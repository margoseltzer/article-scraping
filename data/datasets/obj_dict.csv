24701,quote,let us seek all peaceful way forward
24702,quote,unfortunately weve seen situations in which a small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity and in some cases violence

24726,quote,he could have launched a program to try to rebuild and reopen and reengineer hope in these communities
24727,quote,and instead he became the person who talked about you know the cambridge policeman was wrong and you know ferguson was wrong and why florida was wrong

24943,quote,mckesson said while the federal government has a role to play in reforming police behavior the onus is really on local departments to change their ways
24944,quote,the department of justice could reduce funding to local police departments and they havent really done that aggressivelyin the meantime mckesson said he would continue trying to draw attention to the issue
24945,quote,campaign zero on wednesday launched a new project at useofforceprojectorg  which takes a look at 91 of 100 police departments in the biggest cities in the united states
24946,quote,the report examines the use of force policies of the departments and concludes whether there are basic protections against police violence in the policies
24947,quote,many police departments fail to establish common sense restrictions on police use of force  including deadly force  that would actually benefit the communities they are supposed to protect and serve
24948,quote,according to our findings fundamentally changing use of force policies can dramatically reduce the number of people killed by police in america
