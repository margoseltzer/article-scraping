        "text": "A campground manager in Eastern Mississippi has been fired after pulling a gun on a black couple, including a veteran, while they were having a Memorial Day picnic.\n\n26-year-old Jessica Richardson, and her husband, 28-year-old Sergeant Franklin Richardson ‚Äî a veteran of the Army National Guard who served a nine-month deployment in the Middle East ‚Äî were both at a Kampgrounds of America (KOA) campground at the Oktibbeha County lake in Starkville, Mississippi with their dog on Memorial Day. According to local news outlet WCBI, the Richardsons asked the campground‚Äôs front office attendant if they needed a reservation to picnic at the lake, and were told that no reservation was necessary.\n\nBut during their picnic, the Richardsons were approached by a KOA employee who was displaying a gun. HuffPost reported that a KOA staffer identified the woman as Ruby Howell, the campground manager. Jessica Richardson recorded her encounter with Howell on her cellphone.\n\nThe real owners of the property, fired the campground employee right after this incident. ‚ÄúThe lake belongs to the *Oktibbeha School District*, by Starkville Kampgrounds of America #KOA a camping site.‚Äù #Mississippi Full article here: üëâüèæ https://t.co/sO44PIOJjX pic.twitter.com/N3EZG7DN5z ‚Äî Jimmy ‚úäüèæ (@Jwheels208) May 29, 2019\n\n‚ÄúShe jumped out [of her car] and the gun was pointed at me, my husband, and our dog,‚Äù Jessica Richardson told WCBI. ‚ÄúIt was just pointing at us.

        "text": "STARKVILLE, Miss. (WCBI)- Monday we brought you the story of a viral video showing a campground employee in Oktibbeha County displaying a gun while telling a couple and their dog to leave the property.\n\n‚ÄúYou can feel the intent behind it. I felt it. I felt the heat from it. I felt it in her eyes. I knew exactly what it was,‚Äù said Jessica Richardson.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRichardson said she and her husband were looking to spend the holiday weekend picnicking with their dog, possibly even renting a cabin.\n\nShe said they googled a nearby Kampgrounds of America location and decided to drive there ‚Äî that‚Äôs when things took a turn for the worse.\n\n‚ÄúShe jumped out and the gun was pointed at me, my husband, and our dog. It was just pointing at us. One finger was on the trigger and one finger was on the lever of the revolver,‚Äù said Richardson.\n\nRichardson said that‚Äôs when she pulled out her cellphone. The woman holding the gun identified herself as the property manager, but her choice of words was less than professional.\n\n‚ÄúShe was just like, ‚Äòget, get, you don‚Äôt belong here, you don‚Äôt belong here, you don‚Äôt belong here,'‚Äù said Richardson.\n\nRichardson said the confrontation was shocking.\n\n‚ÄúTime stopped. Everything stopped. I was confused as to what was going on. It‚Äôs not like we posed a threat to anybody out there walking our dog. There‚Äôs nothing harmful about that,‚Äù said Richardson.\n\n‚ÄúThe fact that she used ‚Äòget, get‚Äô like we were a dog. You say get, get to a stray dog that‚Äôs on your porch. That ‚Äòget, get‚Äô got to me more than ‚Äòyou don‚Äôt belong here,'‚Äù said Richardson.\n\nOn the way out, the couple spoke to another campground employee outside the office who turned out to be the woman‚Äôs husband.\n\n‚ÄúI get out and start talking to him. The first thing he says is ‚ÄòOh, you don‚Äôt need a reservation for the lake.‚Äô Then she pulls up flying, hops out the car, then proceeded to yell at my wife ‚Äòget in the car, you need to get back in the car,‚Äô just cussing her out and she‚Äôs not even saying anything,‚Äù said Richardson.\n\nWith signs at the front entrance and two different stories from employees, the Richardsons were confused, horrified and disappointed. The Army National Guard Sergeant recently returned from a nine-month deployment in the Middle East.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of crazy. You go over there and don‚Äôt have a gun pointed at you, and you come back home and the first thing that happens is you have a gun pointed at you. It‚Äôs kind of crazy to think about,‚Äù said Sgt. Franklin Richardson.\n\nWe reached out to the corporate KOA office and they released this statement to us:\n\n‚ÄúKampgrounds of America does not condone the use of a firearm in any manner on our properties or those owned and operated by our franchisees. The employee involved in the incident has been relieved of her duties at the Starkville KOA.‚Äù",
