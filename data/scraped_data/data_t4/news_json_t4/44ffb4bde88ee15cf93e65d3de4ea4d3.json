        "text": "Washington (CNN) The US government is hurtling toward a potential financial crisis , and no one in Washington seems to know how to stop it.\n\nAs lawmakers trade fire over contempt votes and impeachment, there's been no progress toward reaching a budget agreement or extending the federal government's ability to borrow before September, when the money runs out . That's raising the ugly prospect of more than $100 billion in mandatory cuts as well as an unprecedented default on US debt -- a situation that could trigger a worldwide economic catastrophe.\n\nIt's a mess everyone knows is coming, and yet no one seems to have a plan -- at least at the moment -- for averting disaster.\n\n\"It's one of those cartoonish anvil-over-head moments,\" one senior GOP congressional aide told CNN. \"We all look around knowingly like 'Man, we're about to get crushed by this,' but nobody's really sure how to get out from underneath it right now.\"\n\nEven the battle lines aren't totally clear at this point. There's brewing frustration between President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, as well as questions about what House Democrats will agree to.\n\nThe fight over disaster relief\n\nThe latest sign of the dysfunction gripping Congress came this week, when Republicans and Democrats continued to flounder in months-long negotiations over disaster aid for states recently hit by hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires, typically a subject that can easily win bipartisan consensus but has instead repeatedly fallen apart over unrelated issues.\n\n\"If we can't do this, what the heck can we do on something much bigger?\" Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby asked after a phone call with White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney . \"I hope this is not a preview of coming events.\"\n\nThe Alabama Republican said he told Mulvaney that the inability to pass the aid bill was not a good sign for the tougher negotiations ahead.\n\n\"This is the longest I remember I've ever seen something this important not be resolved,\" Shelby added. \"But I said, 'This is small — very important, but small — compared to what we're going to have to face if we don't get some direction.'\"\n\nThe US government has careened from one fiscal and spending crisis to another for nearly a decade. But as last winter's record-breaking shutdown demonstrated, the wild card now is Trump, whose unpredictable negotiating style has at times left Congress flailing. The President has clashed with Democrats for months over including funding for Puerto Rico in the disaster bill, and his administration has further strained talks with attempts to include Trump's requested $4.5 billion for border security, a move vehemently opposed by Democrats.\n\nShelby pointed to the $100 billion in automatic spending cuts that will be triggered come October if Congress can't reach a deal to raise budget caps for discretionary spending -- that is, almost everything outside of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nCongress reached a two-year deal to raise the caps in 2017. If lawmakers don't approve another hike, the budget will have to fall back down to 2011 levels.\n\nDeadlines can drive dealmaking\n\nLawmakers -- and specifically the top Appropriations members in both chambers -- have wriggled out of impossible negotiations before, generally managing to pull proverbial rabbits out of their hats at the last moment. And, despite the winter shutdown, the 2018 budget process was the most successful in decades, with more than 75 percent of the government funded through a regular process before the end of the fiscal year.\n\nUnlike the disaster aid package, the spending and debt ceiling negotiations come with a hard deadline -- and hard consequences for failing to meet it. For Republicans, it would mean dramatic cuts to defense programs, a central GOP priority. Democrats would have to accept equally painful cuts to domestic programs, which have long been their top priority in talks.\n\nDeadlines, said several aides and lawmakers who talked to CNN for the story, have a way of sharpening the urgency for negotiators on all sides, and a default on US debt is generally considered something members of both parties would prefer to avoid.\n\nBut Shelby is worried his colleagues — and the White House — aren't paying enough attention to the dangers ahead.\n\nOne problem: Trump may not realize how damaging a budget crisis and default would be.\n\nShelby, who raised the issue at Republicans' regular policy lunch this week, said he and his staff are working on a document with the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget that lays out the effects plainly for all to see. He told CNN once it is finished, he plans to bring it to Trump directly to underscore the stakes.\n\n\"I told our caucus yesterday that this will be draconian. They probably haven't thought about it much because they think we'll take care of it,\" Shelby told CNN earlier this week.\n\nBut he acknowledged that time is working against everyone.\n\n\"Here it is June coming up, and wow, we've got some mountains to climb,\" he said.\n\nThe three-legged stool\n\nThe talks are playing out in the wake of Trump's tax reform, which increased the deficit. The President -- who long ago proclaimed himself \"the King of Debt\" -- has nevertheless promised to raise defense spending, and White House officials have actively sought ways to increase the military budget without Congress, drawing objections from Democrats.\n\nIn recent months the White House has toyed with letting the automatic budget cuts take effect in the name of fiscal restraint. It was an idea openly broached by White House representatives at meeting of senior GOP staffers earlier this year, two people familiar with the conversation told CNN. They mentioned other ways to secure money to make up for the defense cuts — none of which were considered plausible by staff in attendance, the people said.\n\nMulvaney has also made clear in conversations with congressional Republicans that he objects to removing caps on domestic spending, according to multiple senators and GOP aides -- though Democrats who control the House have made clear that is a non-starter.\n\nCongressional leaders have attempted to jump start discussion. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, announced publicly last month the creation of a bipartisan staff-level working group to formulate a two-year budget deal and expressed optimism an agreement could be reached. It was an idea that came in the wake of a previously unreported meeting between Trump, McConnell and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy -- one that reflected significant unease across the GOP conference about the looming automatic defense cuts, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. The staff-level group, which is made up of the policy directors of the four top leaders on Capitol Hill, has met twice, but it's unclear how much progress has been made.\n\nDemocrats, burned by the shutdown, have called for negotiations to stay on the Hill.\n\n\"I think that the only way we'll get a budget is the way we've gotten one the last two years, if the President stays out of it,\" Schumer told CNN. \"I think if you talk to my Republican colleagues, and they told you what they're telling us, they'd tell you the same thing.\"\n\nBut Shelby, who has clashed with Mulvaney in past negotiations and has a close and effective working relationship with his Democratic Appropriations counterpart Sen. Patrick Leahy, made clear the White House has to stay involved. Shelby's efforts to brief and keep Trump in the loop were considered a key reason the President finally agreed to end the shutdown fight.\n\n\"We've got a three-legged stool,\" Shelby said. \"Democrat House. Republican White House and president. Republican Senate. We've gotta have all those to hold up the stool.\"\n\nLawmakers have until September to keep the government open and head off a repeat of this past winter's meltdown. That partial shutdown left about 800,000 federal employees unpaid over the holidays, as well as an unknown number of government contractors who did not receive back pay. The shutdown, which originated with a fight over funding for a border wall, ended after staffing issues with air traffic controllers caused flight delays in New York and around the country's major airports, creating political blowback for the President.\n\nExtraordinary measures are only a temporary fix\n\nLess discussion seems to be going on around the debt issue. Since the first World War, Congress has tried to limit federal borrowing, and has routinely raised the borrowing limit as the US government debt has grown. The debt limit was suspended in 2015, after Republicans danced with default amid a fight with the Obama administration.\n\nThe limits went back into effect in March, but the US government has been able to use so-called \"extraordinary measures\" to keep paying its bills. Those measures are expected to run out in early fall.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has called for lawmakers to raise the debt limit as soon as possible, but lawmakers have so far been unwilling to give up leverage over hot-button issues like immigration -- though top Democrats have also indicated they're unwilling to risk US creditworthiness.\n\n\"America is not going to welch on its debts and what it owes. So I think we ought not to use that as a political issue,\" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Wednesday. \"But, and this is a big but, we need to avoid a crisis of shutting down the government as happened under the Republican leadership in the last Congress, which bled over to this Congress. As a result, I am urging that we do both in a bipartisan, constructive way.\"\n\nAsked whether that meant he wanted to deal with the debt limit alongside appropriations legislation, Hoyer said he was open to any approach that would get a deal done.\n\nRep. Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican, said Shelby's warning should serve as a wakeup call for both chambers.\n\n\"Senator Shelby is telling everybody in this chamber what they need to know, that we need to get out of partisan gamesmanship and get focused on governing the country: moving Approps bills, taking care of the debt ceiling,\" he said.\n\n\"Both sides seem to think they can leverage these things into something, and I don't think you can,\" Cole added. \"Every time you do, you end up in a government shutdown.\"\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly identify Hoyer as House Majority Leader.",

House Democrats are engaged in their most significant internal battle of their majority. Neither party's congressional leadership knows exactly what President Donald Trump would support or sign, aides on both sides say.\n\nReminder of what's at stake: Congressional leaders are desperately seeking to forestall more than $120 billion in automatic spending cuts, as well as a catastrophic debt default. The preferred method is to strike an all-encompassing two-year budget deal. At this point, after several meetings of top negotiators, things have moved further away from a deal. The internal dynamics of the Democratic caucus laid bare by the immigration funding fight two weeks ago have only served to exacerbate concerns about any path to a final resolution.\n\nBottom line: The House and Senate are in session for a grand total of seven weeks before an end-of-September spending deadline, with a month-long August recess smack in the middle of it. While there is no agreement on a spending deal, or even the process of what's next at the moment, there is agreement on this: things need to start moving, and fast.\n\nScheduling: As of now, there are no meetings scheduled between congressional leaders and top White House negotiators this week, aides say. That could change -- and congressional aides have indicated they would like it to change in order to jump start talks -- but as of now, nothing is on the books.\n\nRead More",

        "text": "(CNN Business) On Saturday, the federal borrowing limit set by Congress kicks back in, freezing US debt at its current level -- a shade over $22 trillion, a record high -- and there's no clear plan in sight for lawmakers to extend new borrowing power.\n\nWhile the US Treasury isn't immediately at risk for default, the situation raises that alarming prospect, which Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell described earlier this week as a \"very big deal.\"\n\nBut White House economist Kevin Hassett, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, downplayed the risk on Friday.\n\n\"I can tell you that if you look back at previous debt limit debates, that they've always sort of worked out in the end,\" Hassett told CNN's Poppy Harlow.\n\nThe ceiling was initially intended to control spending by the federal government, but instead Congress has continued to approve increases to accommodate continued borrowing.\n\nLast year, Congress suspended the limit altogether rather than voting to raise it -- a move aimed at forcing spending cuts, or at least preventing Republicans from having to vote for more borrowing ahead of the midterms. That suspension runs out March 1, but this isn't the first time the US government has run up against the debt limit.\n\nFor years, the United States has been spending more money than it collects in taxes and other revenue, forcing the Treasury Department to borrow money by issuing bonds.\n\nThe modern debt limit was formally established in 1939 as World War II was looming, and it was regularly raised without any political fights until 1953.\n\nThat year, the Senate tried to block Republican President Dwight Eisenhower from raising the limit to build a national highway system. And the politicized debate over the debt limit has routinely resurfaced over the ensuing decades.\n\nIn the 1960s, the issue was raised again for those worried about the expansion of government spending due to federal credit guarantees, new social insurance programs, and the escalation of the Vietnam War.\n\nDebt limit measures were also a feature of congressional conflicts with the Nixon and Ford administrations in the early 1970s.\n\nAnd in 2011, some Republicans threatened not to raise the debt ceiling in a standoff with former President Barack Obama over a government spending impasse. Fears that the US might renege on its payments rattled financial markets and wound up forcing the S&P, a major credit rating agency, to downgrade its rating of sovereign US debt for the first time in history.\n\nAnd as far as immediate prospects today, policy analysts don't expect Congress to be rushing anytime soon to lift the statutory limit.\n\n\"We think there is little appetite for a fight over the debt ceiling, and we expect Congress will raise the debt ceiling in the next several months,\" Brian Gardner, director of Washington Research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote in a note to clients this week.\n\nOnce the deadline passes, Treasury will no longer be able to borrow additional funds to cover its costs. Instead, it will have to employ so-called \"extraordinary measures\" -- a tactic both Democratic and Republican administrations -- have used to continue to pay the country's IOUs.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ahead of the March 1 deadline, formally notifying her that he would need to start taking \"certain extraordinary measures in order to temporarily prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations.\"\n\nThe Treasury will run out of money to pay the nation's bills by the end of the government's fiscal year around Sept. 30, according to a forecast by the Congressional Budget Office this week.\n\nThe Trump administration has not yet released a formal estimate of when it anticipates to run out of money.\n\nA borrowing crunch is different than last month's 35-day government shutdown, which was essentially an accounting problem. Without borrowing authority, the Treasury will run out of operating cash -- at which point, according to the CBO report, \"the government would be unable to pay its obligations fully, and it would delay making payments for its activities, default on its debt obligations, or both.\"\n\nA default would risk the position of US debt as a global safe haven investment and rattle financial markets.\n\nPresident Donald Trump last year suggested he'd be open to getting rid of the debt ceiling altogether as he tried to strike a budget deal with Democratic congressional leaders last year.\n\nWhen asked earlier this week about the economic effect if Congress does not to vote to raise the debt ceiling soon, Powell said it would be a \"distraction\" and create \"a lot of uncertainty\" for what he described as \"a pretty good economy.\"\n\n\"It's beyond even considering that the United States would not honor all of its obligations and pay them when due,\" Powell told senators on Tuesday, while testifying on the state of the US economy. \"It is just something that can't even be considered.\"",

        "text": "Washington (CNN) Months before Mick Mulvaney was picked as President Donald Trump's acting chief of staff, he requested a meeting with Trump to sell himself as the best man to run his chaotic White House.\n\nMulvaney boiled his case down to three main points. First, he reminded Trump that he'd spent the previous two years successfully managing two federal agencies, the Office of Management and Budget and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with almost no dysfunction. Secondly, he said he had demonstrated fierce loyalty to the President.\n\nMulvaney saved what he thought was the most important point for last: he had no plans to rein Trump in, according to a person familiar with Mulvaney's ideas.\n\nThe pitch provides a window into how Mulvaney has approached the job as Trump's third chief of staff. White House aides say Mulvaney has staked out a clear strategy of avoiding friction with the President or his family.\n\nThat's won Mulvaney praise from senior staff and helped him avoid the internal battles that contributed to the eventual downfall of his two predecessors, Reince Priebus and John Kelly.\n\nBut the approach has its downsides. Namely, critics say, Mulvaney has failed to perform what many past chiefs regard as the most important part of the job: focusing the President's time on critical issues, managing the information that reaches his desk, and in the case of Trump, serving as a guardrail against an unpredictable president's most self-defeating instincts.\n\nA senior White House official, who praised Mulvaney's leadership overall, described Mulvaney's approach to dealing with Trump as focused primarily on securing the President's affection, even if it sometimes means obscuring hard truths.\n\n\"If Mick is guilty of anything, it's that he's more of a glass half full kind of guy,\" said John Czwartacki, senior adviser to Mulvaney for strategy. \"It doesn't mean he ever obscures facts but he tends to view the world through an optimist point of view.\"\n\nIn light of the recently released Mueller report, being too deferential to Trump could carry some significant risks. The report lays out numerous occasions of aides refusing to do as Trump instructed, provoking the President's ire but also saving him from potentially incriminating and obstructive behavior.\n\n\"You have to be able to ensure that the President is in many ways protected from himself,\" said Leon Panetta, who spent three years as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and who is also close to former chief of staff John Kelly. \"Otherwise you're not worth a damn if you're not protecting the county.\"\n\n\"You're not hired to be a court jester to a king, you're hired to serve the country,\" Panetta added.\n\nTo others though, that misses the point of Mulvaney's strategy, and the uniqueness of working for this President.\n\n\"Trump has a unique management style and if you get how he operates then you can function better than some of the guys who came in and thought I'm going to get this job and do whatever I want because the world loves me and I was elected to nothing,\" said Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative policy group.\n\nThe anti-John Kelly\n\nMuch of Mulvaney's tenure has been defined by how much of Kelly's management strategies he has rejected. In an interview with The Atlantic, Mulvaney sharply criticized Kelly for cultivating an unhealthy work environment.\n\n\"When I got here, morale wasn't what it needed to be,\" Mulvaney told the magazine. \"I don't think I'm telling any secrets -- John hated the job. And let everybody know.\"\n\nBut Panetta, who has spoken to Kelly in recent weeks, said the former Marine general was simply being honest about the challenges of the job.\n\n\"That job under Trump is a son of a b****,\" Panetta said. \"(Kelly) believes in discipline. He believes you don't accomplish a mission unless you have a disciplined force.\n\n\"It took a while but he realized he was dealing with someone who was totally undisciplined,\" Panetta added.\n\nTrump aides say the most noticeable difference has been the way Mulvaney deals with the President's daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Where Kelly tried to limit their access and influence , Mulvaney has essentially stayed out of their way, a move that many in the West Wing attribute to Mulvaney watching the political damage Kelly did to himself in his fights with Ivanka and Kushner.\n\n\"(Mulvaney) has the benefit of hindsight to know that is going to piss off the President and make enemies of the only staffers in the White House who can't get fired,\" said one White House official.\n\nNot only has Mulvaney not interfered with Ivanka and Kushner's access to the Oval Office, he has allowed them to expand their portfolios.\n\nIn recent months, for example, Kushner along with Mulvaney were among the President's lead negotiators during the government shutdown and have continued talks with Democrats about immigration legislation even after the President escalated his threats to close the southern border with Mexico.\n\nRather than rein them in, aides say Mulvaney has opted instead to use Ivanka Trump and Kushner's unique relationship with the President to his own advantage.\n\nWhile one official described Mulvaney as seeking to \"empower\" the two senior aides for their own benefit, others in the White House see it as a shrewd move designed to keep him in his job longer.\n\nPeace but no progress\n\nRegardless of the motivation, multiple Trump aides describe the mood among staff as unusually content under Mulvaney's leadership.\n\nSeveral say that the infighting and back-biting that characterized the first two years of Trump's presidency has dissipated. While Kelly's attempts to instill discipline and order into the West Wing gained him a reputation as being combative, Mulvaney's under-the-radar demeanor have made him relatively few enemies in a staff more accustomed to the power struggles of Trump's first two years in office.\n\nYet for all the peace, there have been few accomplishments. In the first four months of Mulvaney's tenure, there have been no major policy or public relations successes. And several political missteps. Mulvaney has presided over the longest government shutdown in history, which most polls say the American public blames Trump for , a threat to close the US border with Mexico which likely would have caused catastrophic economic damage, and a near crisis of Trump's making when he -- with Mulvaney's encouragement -- forced health care onto the Republican agenda, over the objections of his party.\n\nParadoxically, as Mulvaney's public image has soured, his standing with Trump has solidified, according to White House officials and sources close to the president.\n\n\"I think he's the perfect fit for the President,\" said Christopher Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax and a longtime friend of Trump. \"He gives the President his space and lets him shine and he protects his back.\"\n\nThough people close to the President say that it is still early in Mulvaney's tenure, Trump is notably more relaxed around the former congressman, who has been careful not to make the President think he is being watched or monitored.\n\n\"He doesn't like people shadowing him all the time,\" said one person close to Trump.\n\nTrump's level of comfort with Mulvaney was on display in recent days, when hours after the Mueller report was released, they dined together along with their wives at Mar-a-Lago, according to multiple sources.\n\nIn his short time as acting chief of staff, Mulvaney has traveled frequently with the President to his Florida club -- making himself a notable, but unobtrusive presence as the President catches up with friends and patrons.\n\nShortly after Mulvaney got the job, amidst a tumultuous period during the government shutdown, Trump -- who is known to blame top aides for rocky periods in his presidency -- quizzed friends and advisers about how Mulvaney was doing.\n\nUpon receiving positive feedback, Trump remarked: \"I think he's good, too. He's better than the other two.\"\n\nPolicy chops\n\nMulvaney also comes to the job with policy expertise that both Priebus and Kelly lacked. Among the three, Mulvaney is also the only to have ever been elected to office. Before joining the administration in 2017, Mulvaney served three terms as a House Republican, focused on cutting government spending. That, along with his time as Trump's budget director, have won Mulvaney a reputation as a policy wonk in what is often a detail-averse White House.\n\nIn meetings with the President, Trump often uses Mulvaney as a walking encyclopedia, asking him to weigh in with facts and information in discussions with lawmakers and allies on policy.\n\nMulvaney has filled the West Wing with like-minded technocrats, many of whom he brought over from the OMB. That's given Mulvaney a core group of loyal allies in the West Wing, as well as a base of policy expertise to help advance the sort of right-leaning agenda that he might have favored during his time as a member of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nMulvaney allies now fill key roles at the helm of the Office of Management and Budget and the Domestic Policy Council, helping him shape Trump's policy on across the board budget cut proposals and on health care.\n\nLast month, Mulvaney, backed by acting Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought and Domestic Policy Council Director Joe Grogan convinced Trump to back a lawsuit by states attorneys general seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, over the objections of Attorney General William Barr and Health and Human Services Secretary.\n\nThough Senate Republicans ultimately convinced the White House to stand down on pushing an overhaul of health care until after the 2020 election, the incident highlighted the unusual power Mulvaney wields over key policy decisions, something Kelly, who never served as a politician or political aide, ever attempted.\n\nIndeed, Trump, lurching from urge to urge, has plunged the White House into conflict with Capitol Hill over health care and the ideas of closing the southern border.\n\nTrump's health care decision forced congressional Republicans head-first into a health care fight they didn't want. And Trump's threats to close the US Mexico-border, which Mulvaney doubled down on in Sunday morning television appearances days after Trump floated the possibility, had to be walked back less than a week later.\n\nMulvaney has not made it his business to dissuade the president in any of these cases.\n\nHe is \"banking that this a president willing to be bold even if it doesn't work,\" another White House official said.\n\nOther aides believe the policy missteps and lack of coordination during Mulvaney's time as chief of staff have less to do with him and more with the president.\n\n\"Mick did go in with eyes wide open. You can't try to limit what the President's going to do,\" said a different official said. \"You can provide options but ultimately, he's going to say and do what he wants.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with comments from Mulvaney's senior adviser for strategy, John Czwartacki",

        "text": "Donald Trump isn't afraid of debt.\n\n\"I'm the king of debt. I love debt,\" Trump told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday, seemingly trying to explain the comfort level he has with debt after a long business career that included four bankruptcy filings by his companies.\n\nTrump made the comment in response to a question about whether it's time to bail out Puerto Rico, which is in the midst of an economic crisis. However, Trump said he opposes the bailout because Puerto Rico has too much debt and needs to cut it down, without help from the federal government.\n\nDespite his \"love\" for debt, Trump is worried about another debt-related issue: how much the U.S. has to pay in interest on its $19 trillion of debt.\n\n\"If interest rates go up one percent, that's devastating,\" the presumptive GOP nominee for president told CNBC on Thursday. \"What happens if that interest rate goes up 2, 3, 4 points? We don't have a country.\"\n\nBut Trump raised eyebrows by suggesting an unorthodox approach towards cutting the national debt.\n\nAsked if the U.S. needs to pay its debt in full or if it could negotiate a partial repayment, Trump said: \"I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal.\"\n\nSuch a renegotiation risks creating financial turmoil because U.S. Treasuries are considered the safest assets on the planet and a major benchmark for valuing other securities. Calling into question their safety could cause borrowing rates to rise and create confusion in the markets.\n\nAt first glance, Trump's endorsement of low rates would seem to make him a fan of Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, under whose leadership rates have continued at near-zero. She is also known as a \"dove\" because of her cautious stance against raising rates.\n\nBut Trump told CNBC that if he became president he would \"most likely replace\" Yellen when her term expires in January 2018. He pointed out that she's \"not a Republican.\"\n\nTrump did call Yellen a \"very capable person\" and said \"people I know have a high regard for her.\"\n\nRelated: Famed investor sounds the crisis alarm\n\nLast year Trump criticized Yellen, who was appointed by President Obama in 2014, for keeping rates low for \"political reasons.\"\n\nBut Trump's seemingly-contradictory call for low rates and also replacing Yellen has observers on Wall Street scratching their heads. After all, Republican-leaning Fed chiefs tend to be hawks, not doves. They prefer to raise interest rates more quickly to ward off inflation.\n\n\"Are we looking at a dovish, deficit building GOP nominee here?\" Michael Block, chief strategist at Rhino Trading, wrote in a note. \"So maybe he wants someone more dovish. Like... an actual bird. Or someone in a large bird costume.\"\n\nRelated: Should investors fear President Trump or Clinton?\n\nTrump also threw his weight behind the idea of spending heavily to revamp America's roads and bridges. It's an idea that many Democrats, including Obama, have embraced as a way to breathe life into the economy while simultaneously investing in the future.\n\n\"The beautiful thing about infrastructure is it puts people to work, immediately puts people to work,\" Trump said.\n\nHowever, some worry that Trump hasn't spelled out a credible way to pay for all that new spending. In fact, on Thursday he reiterated plans to dramatically lower taxes.\n\n\"Deficits would explode in his administration,\" Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments, said in a report on Thursday.\n\nRelated: Everything you want to know about Trump's bankruptcies\n\nThis week influential investor Jeff Gundlach predicted Trump will win the White House -- and boost the national debt in the process.\n\n\"Let's face it, Donald Trump is extremely comfortable with debt,\" Gundlach said at the 21st Annual Sohn Investor Conference in Manhattan.\n\nOf course, dramatically higher government spending with no new revenue to pay for it would likely rile financial markets.\n\nIn other words, the bond market may sell off and rates will go up -- exactly the outcome Trump warned against.",

        "text": "Washington (CNN) Nancy Pelosi was officially elected the new House speaker on Thursday in a majority vote by the House of Representatives on the first day of the 116th Congress.\n\nShe defeated the Republican nominee Kevin McCarthy, winning 220 votes. McCarthy becomes the House minority leader.\n\nAs House speaker, Pelosi will regularly face off against President Donald Trump and will preside over an emboldened and energized Democratic majority that is poised to launch aggressive oversight of the President and his administration.\n\nOne of the most immediate challenges confronting Pelosi as leader of the new House Democratic majority will be the fight over the President's long-promised border wall that triggered a standoff between congressional Democrats and the President and resulted in a partial government shutdown, which is now in its second week.\n\nPelosi also makes history as she reclaims a title she previously held when she served as the first and so far only female House speaker from 2007 to 2011.\n\n\"We enter this new Congress with a sense of great hope and confidence for the future and deep humility,\" Pelosi said in remarks shortly after being elected to the speakership.\n\n\"Our nation is at a historic moment,\" she continued. \"Two months ago, the American people spoke and demanded a new dawn.\"\n\nA small, but vocal, faction of Democrats initially worked to derail Pelosi's bid to become the next speaker following the 2018 midterm elections, but no challenger against her ever emerged and she ultimately succeed in winning over many of her critics.\n\nTwelve Democrats voted for others besides Pelosi, including former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, Rep. Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts, Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, and Stacey Abrams, who unsuccessfully ran for governor of Georgia. Three Democrats voted present.\n\nPelosi has already outlined a plan for Democrats to pass a legislative package later in the day on Thursday to re-open shuttered parts of the government. Contrary to the President's demands for $5 billion for a border wall, however, the legislation does not provide any new wall funding, setting up an early confrontation between the new Democratic majority and the administration.\n\nPelosi spoke about other priorities on the Democratic agenda after her election on Thursday -- describing climate change as well as income inequality as pressing problems that need to be addressed.\n\n\"We will call upon bold thinking to address the disparity of income in America, which is at the root of the crisis of confidence felt by so many Americans,\" Pelosi said.\n\n\"We must also face the existential threat of our time: the climate crisis,\" she added.\n\nIn a nod to the historic nature of her election, Pelosi said she felt \"particularly proud\" to serve as \"the woman speaker of the House of this Congress which marks the 100th year of women having the right to vote.\"\n\nShe added that it is a \"privilege to serve with over 100 women members of Congress, the largest number in history.\"\n\nPelosi's path to the speakership\n\nPelosi always projected confidence that she would reclaim the Speaker's gavel, but faced criticism and pushback along the way.\n\nAt the end of November, she secured the nomination to become speaker by winning support from a majority of House Democrats -- a total of 203 votes in closed-door leadership elections. But she came up slightly short of the total 218 votes typically needed to win the speakership in the final January vote.\n\nTo become Speaker requires the support of a majority of all members of the House who are present and voting, a threshold that could be as high as 218 votes. It would be possible for Pelosi to win with fewer votes, as several previous House speakers have, if some members vote present or decline to participate.\n\nAhead of the final vote, Pelosi deployed her deal-making abilities to win over detractors, and by mid-December, she appeared to have secured the votes necessary to prevail after negotiating an agreement with some of the Democrats who had been lobbying to block her from the speakership. As part of the agreement, Pelosi backed a proposal to enact term limits for the party's top three leaders.\n\n\"I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new Members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,\" Pelosi said in a statement at the time.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments from Thursday.",

Roy Blunt, a Republican from Missouri and member of leadership, told CNN about the odds for an agreement.\n\nThe meeting Wednesday will focus on raising the budget caps for both domestic and military spending. Without an agreement, automatic budget cuts from 2011 would go into effect, a result that both Republicans and Democrats agree could devastate government programs and paralyze the military. Ahead of the meeting, Sen. Dick Shelby, the Alabama Republican and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he called Pelosi on Saturday arguing it was time to \"get together\"\n\nRead More",

Richard Shelby of Alabama, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, wouldn't provide any details about what a new offer might look like but said White House staff would work with congressional staff over the two-week recess when both chambers will be away.

        "text": "President Donald Trump proclaimed Tuesday, despite local politicians' complaints, that “the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump.” | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images White House Trump accuses 'grossly incompetent' Puerto Rican politicians of misusing federal hurricane aid\n\nPresident Donald Trump criticized Puerto Rico's government on Tuesday over federal aid directed to the island territory, pushing an inaccurate figure for the cost of hurricane recovery effort and ripping local leaders as “grossly incompetent” and corrupt.\n\nIn a string of tweets late Monday night and Tuesday morning, Trump falsely claimed that “Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before.” According to The Washington Post, that amount is likely the sum of $41 billion in approved aid and a $50 billion estimate of recovery costs over as much as the next 20 years. Even less than the appropriated $41 billion has actually been spent on the island thus far, the Post reported.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump continued, complaining that Puerto Rico’s leaders only “complain & ask for more money” and writing that they are “grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, & only take from USA.”\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley doubled down on Trump's false claim, telling MSNBC that the island has \"received more money than any state or territory in history for a rebuild.\" He insisted that the president's $91 billion figure was accurate because it is the amount of money pledged to the island.\n\nGidley said he is unsure when the White House will disperse the rest of the already appropriated aid to Puerto Rico and does not have a timeline for that.\n\n\"They can't handle what we have given them already,\" he claimed. \"They are letting food rot in the ports.\"\n\nTrump has previously complained about the cost of the recovery effort in Puerto Rico, which was battered by a pair of hurricanes in the fall of 2017 that left much of the island devastated and without power for months after. The government’s response was widely panned compared to disaster relief efforts in places like Florida and Houston, which were also slammed by powerful hurricanes that year.\n\nThe president has faced accusations that his administration was not prioritizing disaster relief efforts in Puerto Rico as much as in red states like Florida and Texas, claims that were compounded by reports that he planned to divert relief funding for Puerto Rico toward his proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, an idea that faced fierce bipartisan pushback.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe president has also previously clashed with the Democratic mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Carmen Yulín Cruz, whom he called “crazed and incompetent” in a tweet late Monday night after Senate Democrats sunk a disaster relief package as a protest over what they said was inadequate funding for Puerto Rico.\n\nBut, Trump proclaimed Tuesday, despite local politicians' complaints, that “the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump.”\n\n“So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted,” he added. “Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation!”\n\nThe president has since received pushback for his comments that Puerto Rico only takes from the United States, since the island is a U.S. territory. The phrase \"Puerto Rico Is The USA\" began trending on twitter following Trump's tweets.\n\nGidley claimed during the MSNBC interview that accusations that Trump doesn't know Puerto Ricans are actually U.S. citizens is \"absolutely ridiculous.\" Still, Gidley sitestepped questions as to whether Trump believes Puerto Ricans are equal to U.S. citizens living on the mainland.\n\n\"He has actually already traveled to Puerto Rico after this horrific hurricane. He was there,\" Gidley answered when asked about what Trump's actual view of Puerto Rico is.\n\nDuring his interview, the White House spokesman also referred to Puerto Rico as a country, rather than a territory.\n\n\"They have not come to $91 billion with all we've done in that country,\" he said. In response to a follow-up question, Gidley said his mistake in identifying Puerto Rico as a nation separate from the U.S. was a \"slip of the tongue.\"\n\n\"That was a mistake,\" he said. \"A slip of the tongue is not on purpose. It's a territory.\"",

So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted. Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019\n\nWe found that Trump is wrong about the dollar amount the territory has received and wrong when he said it was a record.\n\nHis comments about hurricane aid follow other misleading statements he made related to the 2017 hurricanes Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico. Trump mischaracterized the death toll saying the estimate was \"done by Democrats,\" and he exaggerated the poor condition of Puerto Rico’s electrical grid before the hurricanes.\n\nThe future of aid to Puerto Rico is up in the air after the Senate failed to move forward on legislation. Both parties have pointed fingers at each other for not reaching an agreement after months of proposals.\n\nWhile proposals from both parties have included $600 million for food assistance for Puerto Rico, Democrats want millions more for other needs in Puerto Rico including for the electrical grid, FEMA reimbursement and water projects.\n\nPuerto Rico has not received $91 billion\n\nThe federal government’s recovery website shows shows $40.7 billion has been allocated (Congress appropriated the spending) through December 2018. Of that, $19.4 billion has been obligated (the government has promised to spend the money) and of that $11.2 billion has been spent. The money comes from various agencies and funds including FEMA, U.S. Housing and Urban Development, the Community Development Fund and the Disaster Relief Fund.\n\nA senior administration official told PolitiFact that Trump arrived at the $91 billion figure by combining the roughly $41 billion already allocated with additional estimated future FEMA costs of $50 billion. (The Washington Post’s Fact Checker wrote that the $50 billion was a high end estimate of what would need to be committed under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988.)\n\nThat means the $50 billion is speculative, said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n\n\"It may be spent, it may not, and some of it will be far into the future,\" he said.\n\nHow far into the future? A look at Katrina spending shows it can last for more than a decade after a storm.\n\nThere is still Disaster Relief Fund money being paid out related to Katrina (and Rita and Wilma, also 2005 storms), to the tune of nearly $200 million this year, Ellis said.\n\nSorting out exactly how much the federal government has spent after disasters is tricky. Some hurricanes hit more than one state, and some states receive money for multiple disasters.\n\nComparing how much various jurisdictions have gotten for different disasters is not an apples-to-apples comparison because some disasters create more damage. Comparisons to disaster aid in Puerto Rico versus other storms also omits inflation and that it is more expensive to get disaster supplies to Puerto Rico ,which is located approximately 1,000 nautical miles from the U.S. mainland.\n\n\"Obviously Puerto Rico is not in the continental U.S. so all supplies have to be sent by ship or plane, which increases costs,\" Ellis said. \"You can truck supplies into Louisiana and Texas and Florida. Inflation is a factor -- $1 billion in 2005 is worth more than $1 billion in 2017.\"\n\nFederal officials did not respond to our questions asking how Trump concluded that the $91 billion figure was more than any other disaster. But federal reports show that the government has already spent more on Hurricane Katrina -- and that’s without factoring in inflation. The Congressional Research Service estimated in 2014 that \"Congress provided roughly $120 billion for Hurricane Katrina.\"\n\nIn his attack on Puerto Rico disaster spending, Trump said that we \"cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation!\"\n\nThe federal government pays for disasters in various states and the territory of Puerto Rico, which is a part of the United States. (This is despite the comments by White House spokesman Hogan Gidley on MSNBC who referred to Puerto Rico as \"that country.\" He called it a slip of the tongue.)\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump tweeted \"Puerto Rico got $91 Billion for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before.\"\n\nTrump arrived at that figure by combining the $41 billion already allocated with additional estimated future FEMA costs over the life of the disaster of $50 billion. But that future payment is speculative, and it will be years before we know how much of it is realized.\n\nEven if the $91 billion is the ultimate cost down the road, the federal government already has estimated it spent $120 billion on Hurricane Katrina.\n\nWe rate this claim False.",

        "text": "(CNN) In 2017, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria hit the United States in August and September. The storms were blamed for the deaths of more 3,000 people and caused billions of dollars in damage.\n\nAlthough all three hurricanes were destructive, a new study from online journal BMJ Global Health indicates the US federal response to the hurricane disaster in Puerto Rico was lopsided compared to the response in Florida and Texas.\n\nUsing public data, BMJ created a timeline of staff and funding coming directly from FEMA to those affected by the hurricanes. The study focused on measures of federal spending, distributed federal resources, and direct and indirect storm-mortality tolls. The study says its results show the federal response was faster and \"more generous\" in terms of funding and staffing for Hurricane Irma in Florida and Harvey in Texas than for Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is a self-governing US territory whose citizens are Americans.\n\nAll three hurricanes made landfall as Category 4 storms, and the study indicates its results would make sense if the damage for Maria was less expensive or less altering than those of the other storms. According to CNN reporting, the damage estimate for Maria is $90 billion, $125 billion for Harvey and $50 billion for Irma.\n\nThe combination of direct and indirect storm fatalities also plays a role in understanding the amount of damage inflicted upon the areas, the study says. Hurricane Irma led to 92 deaths, Hurricane Harvey was blamed for 103 deaths and Maria led to 3,040 deaths, according to numbers compiled by BMJ Global Health.\n\nRead More",

        "text": "(CNN) A disaster relief funding package that stalled in Congress this week has exposed strained ties between Capitol Hill and the White House, after one top Senate Republican described \"disagreements\" with a top Trump administration official over the proposal aimed at helping states stricken by recent hurricanes, flooding and wildfires.\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, aired frustrations with the White House's approach to the aid package on Wednesday.\n\nThe comments came after he clashed with President Donald Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, over competing demands for the legislation.\n\n\"Probably in some areas, but we have our disagreements,\" Shelby said when asked whether Mulvaney has played a constructive role in the process.\n\nAfter some thought, he added: \"Constructive role? He's certainly playing a role.\"\n\n\"That's his job, though,\" he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Shelby spoke with Mulvaney on the phone to discuss the disaster relief bill, as well as with Vice President Mike Pence during the GOP Senate lunch.\n\n\"The tone from the Vice President was good. The conversation I had with Mulvaney was candid,\" Shelby told reporters afterward. \"I said, 'Look, this is the longest I remember a big disaster bill that hadn't been resolved.'\"\n\nComplicating matters is an awareness among members of Congress that they won't be passing many major pieces of legislation this year. They see the disaster relief bill as a rare chance to include policy riders and get pet projects passed, which has complicated negotiations and slowed talks.\n\nShelby's personal quibble centers around the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. He has long advocated freeing up money for port maintenance and repairs — something that would help his home state of Alabama — but has faced pushback from the administration and his colleagues on Capitol Hill.\n\nHe said Wednesday that he wants to include the provision in the $17 billion disaster aid bill, and that he had spoken with Mulvaney about it during their phone call.\n\nFor their part, the White House has suggested wrapping in a $4.5 billion request for emergency funding to address an influx of migrants at the southern border, an idea Shelby has pushed back on because it would drive off much-needed support from Democrats.\n\n\"We are looking forward to the House and Senate passing a disaster relief bill to bring aid to those impacted as soon as possible,\" a spokesman for Mulvaney told CNN. \"Other than that we are not in the habit of commenting on private and deliberative conversations with members of Congress.\"\n\nBut the primary reason the bill remains stalled is the divide between the White House, Senate Republicans, and Democrats over how much money to include for Puerto Rico . Democrats want to see more money for the US territory, but Trump has openly opposed the idea.\n\nNegotiators were hopeful for progress earlier in the week, with a GOP offer to include more money for the US territory in the form of block grants and nutrition assistance, along with requirements for how Puerto Rico would be able to spend the money.\n\nBut progress isn't coming easily. It isn't clear Trump would support the additional Puerto Rico funding, even though Senate Republicans largely have no problem with it, and some Democrats have shot down the GOP plan's requirements for how officials would use the aid.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Trump pointed to Democrats when discussing the stalemate during a campaign rally in Panama City, Florida, which was devastated by category 5 Hurricane Michael last fall.\n\n\"Now, we need Democrats in Congress to work with us to pass an acceptable bill, we're getting close,\" Trump said.\n\nOn Thursday night, he tweeted: \"House Republicans should not vote for the BAD DEMOCRAT Disaster Supplemental Bill which hurts our States, Farmers & Border Security. Up for vote tomorrow. We want to do much better than this. All sides keep working and send a good BILL for immediate signing!\"",

        "text": "Washington (CNN) Lawmakers return to Washington this week with a debt limit deadline looming and no clear plan yet to deal with the issue as the clock ticks down.\n\nThe federal government will once again run up against the debt limit when it comes back into effect on Saturday, March 2, at a record high of roughly $22 trillion.\n\nThat could set the stage for a clash between Democrats and Republicans along with President Donald Trump. But despite bipartisan outrage over the size of the national debt, there may not be any significant legislative action from Congress right away.\n\nThat's in part because the United States isn't at risk of an immediate default. The Treasury Department can start taking steps known as \"extraordinary measures\" to prevent that from happening and those measures could last until at least mid-summer. When they run out, the US would reach a point when it would risk default, referred to as the \"X date.\"\n\n\"Not many people are paying attention at the moment,\" said Shai Akabas, the director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \"When the reinstatement goes into effect that will be when people generally start paying attention.\"\n\nTalks on how to address the debt limit are just starting to get underway on the Hill, one congressional Democratic aide told CNN.\n\n\"Conversations on the debt ceiling are at their very beginning phases right now,\" the aide said.\n\nPart of the challenge lawmakers face is finding time to confront issues like the debt limit in the midst of an already hectic schedule.\n\nFor weeks after the start of the new Congress in January, lawmakers had to devote most of their time and attention to working to reopen the government after a standoff between Democrats and the President over border security triggered a partial shutdown. Then, lawmakers had to work to avert a second shutdown, which they ultimately did earlier this month.\n\nThere will also be plenty happening on Capitol Hill this week with issues like congressional reaction to the President's recent national emergency declaration likely to dominate the agenda, as well as Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen scheduled to testify before several congressional committees starting Tuesday.\n\nPotential scenarios for raising the debt limit and costs of getting close to the deadline\n\nIt's not yet clear how lawmakers will ultimately act on the debt limit and there are a number of different scenarios that could play out.\n\nOne potential scenario for raising the debt limit is that lawmakers could try to negotiate a broader agreement involving an increase in the debt limit along with an effort to lift looming budget caps that are set to impact the 2020 appropriations process.\n\nThe new House Democratic majority passed a rule so that if the House approves a budget resolution, that automatically triggers the passage of a separate resolution in the House suspending the debt limit and sending it to the Senate.\n\nBut the suspension would only go into effect if the Republican-controlled Senate and then the President signed off on it.\n\nWhatever happens, there are real risks involved with just getting close to the \"X date.\"\n\n\"Each time we come up against the debt limit, we impose risks and costs that not many people see or even understand, but are really serious to the economy,\" said Akabas of the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nCredit rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit rating of the United States as a result of a fight over the debt limit in 2011 -- in one example of the kind of consequences that can result.\n\n\"If we cross the 'X date' that could have financial ramifications across the world because the US dollar is so important in the global economy,\" Akabas said. \"We don't know what would happen because it's never happened before ... but there's a cost even from coming close.\"\n\nKey House Democrat warns administration against brinkmanship\n\nThere are signs, however, that lawmakers are paying attention to the debt limit fight.\n\nIn a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last month, Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, warned of potential economic fallout if the President decides to \"engage in brinkmanship\" over the debt limit.\n\n\"If the President chooses to engage in brinksmanship on the debt limit, as he did on the shutdown, the market reaction and the cost to our economy would likely be far larger than the 0.02 reduction in GDP that CBO attributed to the shutdown,\" he wrote, referring to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe letter also requested information from the Treasury Department on how and when the administration plans to request that Congress raise the debt limit and what timeline Congress should be operating under to prevent default.\n\nAides to Republican Senate Finance Committee Chair Chuck Grassley have also been in touch with the Treasury Department to discuss the debt limit and the timeline associated with the upcoming expiration of the current suspension.\n\n\"The Chairman's staff is in regular contact with the Treasury Department regarding the debt limit and monitors projections of how long so-called 'extraordinary measures' can be used by Treasury to keep the government below the debt limit once the suspension ends,\" George Hartmann, a spokesman for the Finance Committee chairman, told CNN.\n\n\"We also frequently have discussions with individual member offices on member's thoughts about the debt limit, including thoughts on possible budget-related reforms that could alter the way the debt limit is implemented,\" Hartmann added.",

No policy decision coming from the West Wing ever seems settled, with Trump reversing course at a moment’s notice. “We always say, ‘This is the worst,’” one White House official told us. “But this is really the worst.”\n\nBut walk into Mulvaney’s office, and he’ll tell you everything is fine, even fun! As he sees it, it’s not his place to second-guess the president’s instincts. His job is to “make the president successful and help the president get reelected,” Mulvaney said—and in the meantime, enjoy the perks: unfettered access to the leader of the free world, influence in key policy decisions, and an office with a fireplace down the hall from the Oval. Mulvaney, of course, has an incentive to say all is terrific, all the time, in the White House, in order to appease the boss. Still, he comes across as a guy relishing the ride for as long as it will last. For him, reports that the White House is steeped in more controversies than usual are baseless. From where he sits, legs crossed, jacketless, life in the West Wing is totally serene—and the West Wing becoming a place where Trump has more latitude than ever is exactly the way Mulvaney wants it.\n\nRead: Trump’s guardrails are gone\n\nWhen Trump tapped him for the chief-of-staff gig in December, Mulvaney had already been leading the Office of Management and Budget for almost two years, a job he continues to hold. At first, it looked as if Mulvaney, the president’s third chief of staff in less than two years, wouldn’t last long. His title was acting chief, suggesting that he was merely auditioning for the role while Trump hunted for a permanent replacement.\n\nBut congressional and White House sources, who like others we interviewed spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to talk freely, suggested that Mulvaney actually prefers the qualifier. “He’s always looking to the next thing, and feels ‘acting’ allows him to more fluidly take that next thing when it comes up,” one senior House GOP aide said. Some believe that Mulvaney is interested in succeeding Wilbur Ross as the secretary of commerce, but for now, he’s staying put. “He could fire any of us tomorrow,” Mulvaney said. “So what difference does it make if you’re ‘acting’ or ‘permanent’?”\n\nMulvaney’s first order of business as chief of staff was to loosen the strictures that Kelly had put in place. The retired four-star general had tried in vain to bring some discipline to a freewheeling White House, instituting tighter controls on who was able to see Trump and what information people were able to give him. Even the president’s family members—daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner—were supposed to be subordinate to Kelly in a top-down structure reminiscent of the military culture he knew well.",

On the other side, 29% said it would be unacceptable for the only end to the shutdown to come via a bill that does not include the president's requested funding for the wall.\n\nRead More",

Travelers missed their chance to relive the civil rights leader's legacy and many others were worried they could not visit the sites during the upcoming federal holiday honoring King.\n\nThe historic park will open Saturday for 16 days to ensure people in Atlanta can celebrate King's legacy in advance of the holiday on Monday and travelers attending the Super Bowl game on February 3 have a chance to visit the sites, the park service said.\n\nAn $83,500 grant from the Delta Air Lines Foundation will cover the cleanup, administration, maintenance and operating costs of employees not covered under recreation fee funds.\n\n\"This is yet another example of private organizations stepping up to ensure that our visitors from across the nation and around the world are able to have a meaningful experience at national parks,\" said David L. Bernhardt, acting secretary of the Interior.\n\nIn a statement, Delta CEO and trustee of the Delta Air Lines Foundation Ed Bastian said the group \"felt it was important we do our part to ensure that the historical landmarks be accessible to the public.\"\n\nRelated content Government shutdown: Some parks and monuments may be closed\n\n\"Dr. King was about bringing people together and at Delta, we are about making the world a smaller place,\" he added.\n\nThe Atlanta site includes the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King was co-pastor for years, a visitors' center and the home where King was born in 1929.\n\nThis year, the holiday observed every third Monday in January falls just days after the 90th anniversary of King's birth, January 15.",

She's also talked about imposing a fee on big banks, among other stiffer regulations on Wall Street.\n\nTrump likes to promote himself as the ultimate businessman, but many of his policies appear even more contrary to the traditional U.S. business agenda. He slams free trade and talks of hiking taxes on foreign imports and punishing companies that ship jobs overseas. He wants to deport millions of illegal immigrants and tighten border controls. On top of that, he regularly insults prominent American companies like Ford and Apple.\n\nThe best case scenario for investors\n\nThe best case scenario for business in Valliere's mind is a \"modest Clinton win\" where her zeal for more regulation would be kept in check by a Republican-led Congress.\n\nBut investors need to start thinking about a Clinton blowout -- with Democrats retaking control of the Senate too.\n\n\"Investors would have to contemplate the troika of Clinton, House Speaker Nacy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer -- not a market-friendly scenario,\" says Valliere.\n\nThen there's a scenario of a Trump win, which could cause an avalanche of uncertainty, something the market typically hates.

        "text": "Puerto Rico is dialing 9-1-1 for any help it can get.\n\nThe island was unable to make a $422 million debt payment due Monday. It's another alarm bell of how bad the situation is getting on the island.\n\nGovernor Alejandro Garcia Padilla calls it a \"humanitarian crisis,\" which a step above an economic emergency. He claims he is prioritizing paying Puerto Rico's police and teachers over Wall Street.\n\n\"I had to make a choice. I decided that essential services for the 3.5 million American citizens in Puerto Rico came first,\" the governor said in a speech Sunday.\n\nThis is the third time the island has defaulted on bond payments. The island paid the interest due Monday, but not the principal amount, resulting in a default of about $370 million, Puerto Rico's largest yet.\n\nRelated: Puerto Rico is losing a doctor a day\n\nPuerto Rico is $70 billion+ in debt\n\nPuerto Rico is deep in debt. It owes over $70 billion to creditors. For months, Garcia Padilla has warned that Puerto Rico doesn't have enough money to pay its creditors.\n\nAnother huge payment is due July 1. The island's best hope is that Congress will act before then to provide some sort of relief, such as granting a temporary moratorium on payments until a plan can be worked out.\n\n\"We're very far from the end,\" says Philip Fischer, the managing director of municipal bond research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"It's clear Congress doesn't know how to handle this.\"\n\nRelated: Puerto Rico has become 'dead dog island'\n\nWhat will Congress do?\n\nCongress is in the midst of finalizing an aid package for Puerto Rico. The big sticking point is whether there will be some sort of \"Oversight Board\" overseeing the island's finances for awhile, similar to the model used for Washington D.C. in the late 1990s.\n\nGarcia Padilla and others on the island hate the current proposal. They argue Puerto Rico would lose its democratic rights if the Oversight Board can make decisions that supercede those of elected officials on the island.\n\nThe governor believes the solution is simple: Puerto Rico should be granted Chapter 9 bankruptcy rights -- or something similar -- to make it easier for the island to restructure some of its debts, akin to what Detroit did.\n\nBut many creditors and Republican lawmakers argue that the island has had years of political and financial mismanagement and needs someone from the outside to come in and restore credibility. The island still has not completed its 2014 audit, for example.\n\n\"Congress has a Constitutional and financial responsibility to bring order to the chaos that is unfolding in the U.S. territory,\" Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said last month.\n\n\"Legally, this is very complicated,\" says the long-time municipal bond expert Fischer, who is a lawyer himself.\n\nRelated: I've lost over $200,000 on Puerto Rican bonds\n\nWhat's next for Puerto Rico\n\nThe missed debt payment Monday is on bonds issued by the Government Development Bank, the economic development arm of the island's government. The big fear is that Puerto Rico will default on what is known as General Obligation debt in July.\n\nPuerto Rico owes $1.9 billion on July 1.\n\n\"Our resources are so scarce that we are struggling to pay the fuel supplier for the police patrol cars and emergency response vehicles,\" Governor Garcia Padilla says.\n\nRelated: There's a big sale on Puerto Rican homes\n\nPuerto Rico's missed payments impact its own residents. Many retirees and savers are owners of the bonds. Wall Street hedge funds and other municipal bond funds hold the rest. But so far the overall U.S. bond market has not been negatively effected.\n\n\"It's very serious, but the rest of the bond market is not expecting any contagion from it,\" says Fischer.",

        "text": "A debt-fueled disaster could be coming to the U.S. and China.\n\nThat's what legendary money manager Stanley Druckenmiller warned a roomful of top investors on Wednesday in New York City.\n\nDruckenmiller is very concerned about all the debt Beijing binged on over the past decade. He pointed to China spending trillions of dollars on stimulus projects that led to overcapacity.\n\nChina is in the midst of an \"extremely rare and quite dangerous\" explosion of debt, argued Druckenmiller, whose fortune Forbes estimates at $4.4 billion. He compared the situation with \"subprime mania\" in the U.S. back in the mid-2000s, adding: \"We know how that ended.\"\n\n\"They do not need more debt or more houses. They already have way too much of each,\" Druckenmiller said while speaking at the 21st Annual Sohn Investment Conference.\n\nRelated: Is China fueling a commodities bubble?\n\nDruckenmiller saved his harshest criticism for the Federal Reserve and its ultra low interest rates. He accused the U.S. central bank of shortsighted tactics, borrowing from the future and trying to \"spoon feed\" the stock market.\n\n\"The Fed has no end game,\" he said. \"The Fed's objective seems to be making sure the S&P goes another six months without a 20% decline.\"\n\nDruckenmiller fears the Fed's \"extreme dovishness\" has backfired by removing pressure on politicians to tackle entitlement and tax reform.\n\nRelated: Should investors fear President Trump or Clinton?\n\nDruckenmiller also railed against \"reckless\" behavior from CEOs who spend trillions on share buybacks and mergers and acquisitions instead of investing in the future. He believes the valuations in the market are extremely pricey at a time when global growth is anemic.\n\nGiven that scary forecast, it's not surprising that the only asset class Druckenmiller sounded positive on is gold. The yellow metal, which does well when people are scared, has been on fire this year.",

        "text": "Donald Trump claims America is on the verge of a \"very massive recession.\"\n\nBut don't worry, Trump says he can save the economy and get America out of debt. Just give him eight years in the White House and he'll make America's $19 trillion debt go away.\n\nHow? Trump wants to slash taxes and fix trade deals with China, Mexico and other nations.\n\n\"You have to do a tax cut. Because we're the highest-taxed nation in the world,\" Trump said in a recent interview with The Washington Post.\n\nExperts say: Yeah right.\n\n\"It strikes me as wildly implausible at best,\" says economist Doug Holtz-Eakin, who is president of the right-leaning American Action Forum and a former head of the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nPlans to reduce -- let alone eliminate -- the federal debt typically have three key components: RAISE taxes, cut spending and tweak Social Security and Medicare. Trump is talking about exactly the opposite when it comes to taxes, and he hasn't mentioned any of those other things except some very minor spending reductions.\n\nRelated: How America lost jobs to Mexico\n\nTrump believes the U.S. is on the verge of economic disaster\n\nTrump advises people to get their money out of the stock market.\n\n\"I think we're sitting on an economic bubble. A financial bubble,\" Trump told The WashPost. \"It's a terrible time right now [to invest].\"\n\nIt's not the first time he's made this dire warning. He said the same thing in the fall. He thinks the U.S. economy can't survive the strong dollar, government regulations and buying so many cars and other goods from foreigners.\n\n\"It's precarious times. Part of the reason it's precarious is because we are being ripped so badly by other countries. We are being ripped so badly by China. It just never ends,\" Trump said.\n\nRelated: The U.S. has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs\n\nBut most experts believe the U.S. is NOT on the verge of economic and financial disaster.\n\nThe U.S. stock market is moderately more expensive than usual, but it's not at bubble levels. (The typical valuation metric -- called the price-to-earnings ratio -- is at 17.4. It hit 29 before the dot-com bubble burst. The historic average is about 16, according to numbers guru Howard Silverblatt of S&P Capital IQ).\n\nYes, stocks could go down in the coming months, but that's different from a huge pullback like what happened when the dot-com bubble burst.\n\nSimilarly, the U.S. economy has been growing for almost 7 years. A typical expansion lasts less than 5 years, so, in that sense, the nation is overdue for a downturn. But hardly anyone is forecasting a recession this year and even the gloomiest predictors don't see a \"massive\" slide like what happened during the Great Recession.\n\nRelated: Americans fear a life of 'dead-end crap jobs with crap wages'\n\nTrump's outlandish math on the U.S.debt\n\n\"It's baffling to me that he continues to say things that are ludicrous on the face,\" says Holtz-Eakin, who was John McCain's economic adviser in his 2008 presidential bid.\n\nThe numbers don't add up.\n\nTrump wants to cut taxes, which means less money coming in. On top of that, he won't cut key parts of the federal budget: Social Security or Medicare. Plus he vows to \"strengthen our military\" (Translation: spend more on defense).\n\nWith less money coming in, Trump would actually have to slash over 60% of federal spending.\n\nIt's \"incredibly unrealistic,\" says Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\n\"You would need the tax increases of Bernie Sanders combined with the spending cuts of the House Republican proposal\" to really reduce the debt in a decade, says Goldwein.\n\nRelated: I sent my resume to Donald Trump\n\nAs for Trump's plan to strong arm China, Mexico and other nations into better trade deals, that does little to help reduce U.S. debt. It might bring in a little more in taxes on foreign goods, but it's not going to produce trillions of dollars of new money.\n\nIn fact, many economists think it's Trump's trade ideas that will cause a recession.",

And in fact, no major U.S. company has filed for Chapter 11 more than Trump's casino empire in the last 30 years.\n\n\"I have used the laws of this country ... the [bankruptcy] chapter laws, to do a great job for my company, for myself, for my employees, for my family,\" he said during the first Republican presidential debate on August 6.\n\nTrump claims that successful businesses file for bankruptcy all the time. At the debate he said \"virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business sections, they've used the [bankruptcy] law.\"\n\nBut the facts don't back that comment up.\n\nDespite high profile examples, including General Motors (GM), Lehman Brothers and most of the nation's major airlines, fewer than 20% of public companies with assets of $1 billion or more have filed for bankruptcy in the last 30 years, according to data from Bankruptcy.com and S&P Capital IQ.\n\nTrump has never filed for personal bankruptcy. But he has filed four business bankruptcies, which Bankruptcy.com says makes Trump the top filer in recent decades. All of them were centered around casinos he used to own in Atlantic City. They were all Chapter 11 restructurings, which lets a company stay in business while shedding debt it owes to banks, employees and suppliers.\n\nRelated: Trump - Tax the rich more\n\nHe makes no apologies for having much of his debt wiped out. \"These lenders aren't babies. These are total killers,\" he said at the debate. \"These are not the nice, sweet little people.\"\n\nHere's a look at Trump's bankruptcy track record.\n\n1. Trump Taj Mahal, 1991\n\nTrump's first bankruptcy filing was probably the most personally painful for him. To come up with the funds he needed, he sold a 282-foot yacht, as well as the Trump Shuttle, the airline he operated at the time that flew between Washington, D.C., New York and Boston, according to media reports at the time. He had to give up half of his ownership stake in the Trump Taj Mahal, but he did retain control of the property. His largest creditor was financier Carl Icahn, who held $400 million in bonds. Now Icahn is Trump's pick for Treasury secretary should he be elected.\n\n2. Trump Castle Associates, 1992\n\nIn less than a year he was back in bankruptcy court for his other Atlantic City casinos. This bankruptcy included the Trump Plaza Hotel in New York, the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City as well as the Trump Castle Casino Resort. He gave up half his interest in the New York Plaza to Citibank, but retained his stake in the casinos.\n\n3. Trump Hotel & Casino Resorts, 2004\n\nTrump didn't go back to bankruptcy court again until November 2004, when he filed to shed debt at his various Atlantic City casinos and a riverboat in Indiana. It was another quick trip through bankruptcy court; the company shed $500 million in debt and emerged from bankruptcy the following May. Trump turned over majority control of the company to his bondholders but remained the largest single shareholder, and he once again kept control of the casinos.\n\n4. Trump Entertainment Resorts, 2009\n\nHis most recent bankruptcy came in 2009, after the company missed a $53.1 million bond payment. That was pretty much the end of the road for Trump in Atlantic City. While his name remained on three casinos, he resigned from the board and gave up his remaining stake in the company.\n\n\"I had the good sense, and I've gotten a lot of credit in the financial pages, seven years ago I left Atlantic City before it totally cratered,\" he said during the debate.\n\nThe two Atlantic City casinos that still had the Trump name filed for bankruptcy yet again in 2014. At the time Trump made sure people knew he was no longer running the company, and sued to have his name removed.",

        "text": "Donald Trump told CNBC on Thursday he's for low interest rates unless inflation perks up, and he would probably replace Janet Yellen when her term is up as Federal Reserve chair. \"I have nothing against Janet Yellen whatsoever. I think she's been doing her job, \" the presumptive GOP presidential nominee said in a wide-ranging phone interview with \"Squawk Box. \" \"I don't know her. She's a very capable person. People I know have a high regard for her. But she's not a Republican,\" he added. Trump argued for low rates to keep the national debt of $19 trillion somewhat manageable. Calling himself \"the king of debt\" in his business dealings, he warned that the national debt would be troublesome if the cost of borrowing increases. \"We're paying a very low interest rate. What happens if that interest rate goes up 2, 3, 4 points?\" he asked. \"We don't have a country.\" The U.S. should refinance longer-term debt, he added.\n\n\"We do need money to rebuild the infrastructure of the country,\" he said, railing against spending trillions of dollars in wars in the Mideast while American roadways, bridges, mass transit systems and airports are crumbling.\n\n\"The beautiful thing about infrastructure is it puts people to work, immediately puts people to work,\" he continued, \"But it's got to be done properly, on time and on budget.\" Trump repeated that he would renegotiate the nation's trade agreements, which he contends were hammered out by \"political hacks\" rather than the \"brightest business people.\" Echoing a common theme, he said China is killing U.S. trade by manipulating its currency. \"So I'm not blaming China. I wish our people would think the same way. I blame our leadership. It's incompetent.\" On immigration, Trump said his policies would not shrink the economy. In the campaign, he's talked about tough measures to make sure people come into the U.S. legally. He's also advocated building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump said if he doesn't win the White House, the Supreme Court would be stacked with liberals who would make the United States a \"totally different country\" — like Argentina or Venezuela.\n\nTrump also gave a 40 percent chance that he would choose his running mate from his former rivals in the race for the nomination.\n\nHe said he has a good relationship with John Kasich, but the Ohio governor, who was the last to drop out, is unlikely to be his VP choice. \"I not sure John even wants it.\" Trump said he prefers to pick a running mate with government experience, because as a businessman he has business issues covered and he'd like help in pushing legislation through. Sen. Jeff Sessions, who has endorsed Trump, would make a \"good anything,\" Trump said in response to a question of whether the Alabama Republican would make a good VP choice. Trump said he'd rather run against Democrat Hillary Clinton than against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, saying she's more beatable because she has \"so much baggage.\" \"I'm now watching her fight it out [with Sanders]. She's going to win again because the system is rigged,\" Trump said. \"[Sanders] cannot win, unless she gets indicted.\" He said Clinton should be held legally responsible for using a private email sever during her time as secretary of state, but he claimed she's being protected by the Democratic machine and is going to \"skate away with it.\" He called the process a \"disgrace.\" Trump said he looks forward to the general election debates. With three on the schedule, he said he wishes there were more. Trump called Obamacare a \"total disaster,\" saying the Affordable Care Act needs to be repealed and replaced. \"The country cannot afford it. People cannot afford it. It's good for almost no one.\" He said he'd get rid of a numerous regulations that he claims hurt big companies and small businesses alike. \"Dodd-Frank has to be either eliminated or changed greatly, \" he said, adding that the regulators are running the banks. Trump said he'd also lower taxes, particularly U.S. corporate taxes, which are higher than those of many countries. Responding to a call by the Rolling Stones for Trump to stop using their music, the billionaire said he uses lots of different songs at his rallies. \"I always buy the rights.\" The Stones said they have not given their permission.\n\nAlso Thursday, the Trump campaign named hedge fund veteran Steven Mnuchin as finance chairman for his general election bid. Trump has boasted that he largely self-funded his primary campaign. Trump's remaining two rivals — Kasich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — dropped out of the race this week after their poor showings Tuesday in Indiana's primary. Trump has amassed 1,055 delegates, 182 short of the 1,237 need to clinch the nomination at this summer's convention. June 7 is the final day of primaries, with contests in California, New Jersey and three other states.\n\n\n\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and services.\n\nBy signing up for newsletters, you are agreeing to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.",

        "text": "The titans of finance gathered this week in Manhattan to share trading tips.\n\nIn case you didn't plop down the $5,000 to hear in person, here are some of the biggest takeaways from the 21st Annual Sohn Investment Conference.\n\nTrump will win -- and pile on lots of debt: Donald Trump may have all but wrapped up the GOP nomination for president, but polls and prediction markets suggest he is still an underdog to actually win the White House. But Jeff Gundlach, the so-called king of the bond market, thinks the polls are wrong.\n\n\"Trump's going to win,\" Gundlach declared at the conference, which raised about $4 million for the Sohn Conference Foundation, which aims to treat and cure pediatric cancer.\n\nGundlach suggested life under a Trump administration would likely include more government spending that adds to the country's massive debt.\n\n\"Let's face it, Donald Trump is extremely comfortable with debt,\" said Gundlach, who previously predicted defense contractors would receive a boost from increased military spending if Trump wins.\n\nGundlach also poked fun at the other GOP presidential candidates, all of whom have already been knocked out.\n\n\"I hear Ted Cruz is going to have a news conference in an hour announcing his Supreme Court nomination pick,\" Gundlach joked just a day after Cruz had suspended his campaign.\n\nRelated: Should investors fear President Trump or Clinton?\n\nBetting against Tesla: Jim Chanos famously predicted the collapse of Enron and also bet against China long before it became the popular thing to do. The elite investor revealed on CNBC from the sidelines of Sohn that he's now shorting Tesla (TSLA).\n\nChanos raised questions about Tesla's recent loss of key executives and about the electric car maker's ability to turn a profit.\n\n\"This is a company that can't forecast its deliveries one quarter out,\" Chanos said \"Yet, everybody is confident about what they're going to make in 2020 or 2025.\"\n\nAfter Chanos revealed his negative bet, Tesla reported a quarterly loss and moved its production schedule up by two years. Predictably, Chanos was unimpressed.\n\n\"I have to tip my hat to the guy,\" Chanos joked. \"He doesn't have enough production capability, not enough batteries, not enough executives, so what does he do? He pulls production two years forward.\"\n\nChanos added, \"That's a showman. I love it.\"\n\nRelated: Obama economy is 'amazing,' Chanos argues\n\nNigeria a \"failed state\": Chanos saved his harshest indictment for Nigeria. He said the OPEC nation is \"caught in a macro hurricane\" of plunging oil prices, a war against terror group Boko Haram and corruption.\n\nChanos said Nigeria is \"rapidly running out of foreign currency reserves,\" and warned if oil prices stay low the country is going to have a \"big problem in two or three years.\" That's why he called it a \"borderline failed state.\"\n\nSouth Africa isn't in much better of a position, Chanos argued. He pointed to extremely high youth unemployment, corruption and the country's \"monstrous debt load.\"\n\nThat's why Chanos is betting against MTN Group, a telecom company that relies on both Nigeria and South Africa for most of its revenue.\n\nRelated: Africa's 4 economies are in trouble\n\nBuy Greece?!: Greece has been a poster child for Europe's problems. The country has gone through three bailouts and faced a huge banking crisis just last year.\n\n\"Greece seems to be the financial risk that Steph Curry is to the three-point shot,\" said Richard Deitz, founder of VR Capital Group -- an asset management firm that invests in distressed debt.\n\nBut Deitz believes the worst is over for Greece because the last bailout actually did the trick. The hedge fund manager argues Greek bank stocks and bonds look \"cheap\" and should rise following a successful review of the bailout program.\n\nThat's why Deitz made the case for buying Greek government debt and Greek bank stocks -- especially Alpha Bank. He thinks soon it will \"become quite evident banks are overcapitalized,\" allowing them to return 25% or more of their current capital to shareholders.",

        "text": "(CNN) House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced a deal Wednesday that could likely deliver her the votes to become speaker again -- but only for another two terms, laying out a timeline she had been reluctant to articulate until now.\n\nThe longtime Democratic leader negotiated an agreement with a small group of Democrats who've been lobbying to block Pelosi from the speakership in their push for a new generation of leadership.\n\nThe deal -- which won over seven of her critics -- would essentially guarantee Pelosi two more years as speaker but she could serve no longer than four years in the job.\n\n\"Over the summer, I made it clear that I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new Members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,\" she said in a statement.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Pelosi is backing a proposal to enact term limits for the party's top three leaders. The agreement that would affect Pelosi, as well as her top two deputies, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina -- a trio that's led House Democrats for more than a decade.\n\nThe agreement stipulates that top leaders can serve for only three terms. Another term sought beyond that would require approval by two-thirds of the Democratic caucus, higher than the current simple majority threshold.\n\nThe proposal is retroactive, meaning Pelosi would be entering her third term in 2019. If she did go on to win a fourth term in 2021 with the support of two-thirds of the caucus, it would have to be her last. Pelosi, along with Hoyer and Clyburn, served for two terms in leadership when Democrats controlled the House from from 2007-2011.\n\nClyburn stands with other members of the Congressional Black Caucus who oppose term limits, according to a source familiar with his thinking. As part of the deal, Clyburn would be term limited as whip after this next session of Congress, unless he wins support from two-thirds support of the caucus to serve a fourth and final term.\n\nPelosi announced the incoming Democratic caucus chairman Hakeem Jeffries and the incoming House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern plan to bring it up for a vote in caucus on February 15.\n\nIf the caucus votes against the term limits proposal, Pelosi said she'll still stick by it.\n\n\"I am comfortable with the proposal and it is my intention to abide by it whether it passes or not,\" she said.\n\nWhile the talks at one point also included term limits for lower-level leadership roles and committee chairs, the agreement announced Wednesday only addressed top leadership positions.\n\nPelosi, as she seeks to shore up support for her speaker bid, has been in active conversations with Rep. Ed Perlmutter of Colorado, who helped manage a letter signed by more than a dozen Democrats vowing to not support Pelosi for speaker.\n\nMoments after the deal was announced, Perlmutter, along with Reps. Bill Foster, Linda Sanchez, Seth Moulton, Tim Ryan, Filemon Vela, and Rep.-elect Gil Cisernos announced they would support her.\n\n\"We wish to thank Nancy Pelosi for her willingness to work with us to reach this agreement. We are proud that our agreement will make lasting institutional change that will strengthen our caucus and will help develop the next generation of Democratic leaders. We will support and vote for Nancy Pelosi for Speaker of the House in the 116th Congress.\"\n\nThe speaker vote is set for January 3. While Pelosi won the nomination for speaker last month with than 85% of the caucus behind her, she needs slightly more than that in the full House vote on January 3.\n\nAt that time, she would need a majority of the full House, which traditionally amounts to 218 votes. With 235 Democrats in the House, she can afford to lose 17 of her own and still get to 218. It's expected many of those anti-Pelosi votes will come from freshmen who pledged to oppose her during their campaigns.\n\nIt's still unclear whether the term limits will be officially adopted, as the caucus still has to approve a rule change and many Democrats have already expressed staunch opposition to the idea. On Tuesday, House Democrats held a heated debate over term limits, ultimately deciding to table the discussion until incoming freshmen members can take part in the conversation at the start of the new year.\n\nBroadly, the idea of term limits is a contentious topic among Democrats, where a divide exists between those eager to see a new generation of leaders and those who say seniority and experience matter.\n\nHoyer, who's been in Congress for three decades and served as majority leader when Democrats last held power, passionately decried the idea of term limits this week. Hoyer noted he had repeatedly cosponsored legislation in the past that called for repealing term limits for the presidency.\n\n\"I'm not for term limits. ... Is anybody confused?\" he told reporters on Tuesday, before reiterating it emphatically. \"I. Am. Not. For. Term. Limits.\"\n\nAsked how he feels about Pelosi entertaining the idea of term limits in her negotiations, Hoyer was frank. \"She's not negotiating for me.\"\n\nRep. Cedric Richmond, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, also said he opposed the idea, saying if people don't like a leader, they can just vote them out at the end of a term.\n\n\"This whole thing about these guys needing something so that they can land this damn plane is getting silly,\" Richmond said, referring to the group of rebels. \"Land the plane. Vote for her. And let's please get on.\"",

        "text": "Story highlights Obama, Congress try to avert automatic budget cuts\n\nThe $1.2 trillion in cuts were part of a plan to end the 2011 debt ceiling standoff\n\nCongress was supposed to replace them with other 10-year spending reductions, but failed\n\nHere we go: A new round of confrontation between the White House and Congress over the federal budget is in the offing, this time in a new attempt to avert the looming \"sequestration\" process.\n\nWhat is sequestration?\n\nIt's a series of automatic, across-the-board cuts to government agencies, totaling $1.2 trillion over 10 years. The cuts would be split 50-50 between defense and domestic discretionary spending.\n\nIt's all part of attempts to get a handle on the growth of the U.S. national debt, which exploded upward when the 2007 recession hit and now stands at more than $16 trillion. The sequester has been coming for more than a year, with Congress pushing it back to March 1 as part of the fiscal cliff deal at the end of the last session.\n\nWhy does this seem familiar?\n\nIt started with the 2011 standoff over the U.S. debt ceiling, when Republicans in Congress demanded spending cuts in exchange for giving the Obama administration the needed legal headroom to pay the federal government's obligations to its bondholders. In the end, Congress and the administration agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts. About $1 trillion of that was laid out in the debt-ceiling bill and the rest imposed through sequestration -- a kind of fiscal doomsday device that Congress would have to disarm by coming up with an equal amount of spending reductions elsewhere.\n\nWhat were they thinking?\n\nThe plan was that a special congressional panel, dubbed the \"super committee,\" would find a less painful way to cut spending. It failed in November 2011. That left federal agencies facing what outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called \"legislative madness\" in the form of harsh cuts that no one wanted.\n\n\"For those of you who have ever seen 'Blazing Saddles,' it is the scene of the sheriff putting the gun to his head in order to establish law and order,\" Panetta said in a speech at Washington's Georgetown University. \"That is sequestration.\"\n\nBut for many conservatives, sequestration is a feature, not a bug. It's \"the first chance we have for real savings and deficit reduction,\" the tea party-aligned lobbying group FreedomWorks tells supporters on its website\n\n\"President Obama already agreed to the sequester savings when he signed the debt ceiling bargain into law,\" FreedomWorks says. \"He needs to follow through.\"\n\nWhere will the cuts fall?\n\nMore than $500 billion will be cut from the Defense Department and other national security agencies, with the rest cut on the domestic side -- national parks, federal courts, the FBI, food inspections and housing aid. While the Pentagon has laid out plans ranging from furloughs of hundreds of thousands of civilian workers to combat readiness training and weapons maintenance, the White House budget office hasn't specified which domestic agencies would take the biggest hits.\n\nPanetta says that the $46 billion in spending cuts for 2013 would cut sharply into military readiness -- and the longer the cuts are pushed back, the deeper they'll have to be to achieve the required savings.\n\nSo now what?\n\nCongress put off the sequester until March 1 as part of the last-minute fiscal cliff deal on New Year's Day. Without that agreement, economists warned that the one-two punch of sequestration and the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts could have thrown a still-struggling U.S. economy into reverse.\n\nEven with the fiscal cliff deal, the austerity moves already were slowing the economy, Obama suggested over the weekend. The Commerce Department said a large cut in federal spending, primarily on defense, contributed to the 0.1% decrease in gross domestic product seen in the last quarter of 2012.\n\n\"Washington cannot continually operate under a cloud of crisis. That freezes up consumers,\" Obama said during a pre-Super Bowl interview with CBS. \"It gets businesses worried. We can't afford these self-inflicted wounds.\"\n\nTuesday, Obama urged Congress to pass a short-term deal that puts off the cuts, allowing some breathing room for a long-term deficit reduction plan. But Obama said any deal should include more revenue from ending some tax breaks -- a stance that inflamed Republicans who already had to swallow a tax increase for top earners in the fiscal cliff deal.\n\n\"I don't like the sequester. I think it's taking a meat ax to our government, a meat ax to many programs that will weaken our national defense,\" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. But, he added, \"Americans do not support sacrificing real spending cuts for more tax hikes.\"",

Trump is clearly more concerned about a pet political project than his constitutional role of providing governance to all Americans.\n\nBut he is not alone in his dereliction of duty. The Republican-led Senate is doing nothing to offer its President a face saving way out. And while House Democrats are going through the motions of passing bills to reopen government, they don't seem to be doing much else to break the logjam. Before Trump was President, party leaders had seemed at least open to funding a barrier on the border as part of wider immigration legislation.\n\nTrump urged party leaders Friday to return to Washington and vote for a wall, a barrier or whatever they want to call it -- even \"peaches.\"\n\n\"This is where I ask the Democrats to come back to Washington and to vote for money for the wall, the barrier, whatever you want to call it, it's OK with me,\" the President said during a White House roundtable on immigration.\n\n\"They can name it whatever. They can name it 'peaches.' I don't care what they name it. But we need money for that barrier,\" he added.\n\nThe stalemate represents a crucial first fight between Trump and his Democratic enemies in Washington's new era of divided government.\n\nBut every battle has victims. And right now it's 800,000 government workers who feel insulted, forgotten and anxious about rent, mortgage, car payment and medical bills piling up.\n\nWhile they fret, nothing is happening in Washington this weekend. In fact, members of Congress, who are getting paid, are off until Monday.\n\nThey might notice as they fly home that the nation's transportation system is under strain. Many of those TSA agents who keep travelers safe are working without pay. An airport in Tampa is opening a food bank for employees. And some food inspections are on hold with government shut down.\n\n\"I would beg both Houses of Congress, I would beg the American people to please look around and understand that federal workers, we have a face — we have families,\" Jacqueline Maloney, a federal worker whose paycheck didn't arrive on Friday, told CNN's Brooke Baldwin in an emotional interview.\n\n\"We might be a neighbor, your best friend, your best friend's mom, your aunt, your cousin. We are everywhere.\"\n\nGovernment shutdowns usually end when the political leaders caught in the standoff calculate that the political damage sustained by standing firm begins to outweigh the embarrassment of a climbdown.\n\nWith tales of anger and deprivation of government workers stuck in a terrible situation beyond their control now dominating news coverage, that point may be coming closer.\n\nNeither side however is showing any sign of cracking yet.\n\nIt's on Trump\n\nBut for Trump, there would have been no shutdown. The President, apparently fearing a backlash in conservative media, refused to keep the government open before Christmas unless he got wall funding.\n\nIn the last week, Trump has tried a variety of political stunts to try to shift the blame. He gave an Oval Office address. He stormed out of talks with Democratic leaders . He flew Air Force One to the border to paint an inaccurate picture of hordes of criminals and killers pouring into the country.\n\n\"The only way you will stop it is with a very powerful wall or steel barrier,\" Trump said at the White House on Friday.\n\nNow, as he seeks taxpayer cash to build a wall that he promised Mexico would pay for, the President is offering the fact-bending claims that America's neighbor has already settled up -- in a yet to be ratified new trade deal.\n\nBy any conventional measure, Trump is guilty of putting his own political ego above the interests of the Americans he leads. For all the power of his campaign trail rhetoric among supporters, he's not shifted the political needle at all. He seems oblivious that in divided government, a President can't just demand what he wants.\n\nTrump's supporters argue that there is a genuine crisis on the border and brand as \"fake news\" any argument that a wall along the frontier with Mexico may not be the best way to tackle drug trafficking and ballooning asylum claims.\n\nIn fact, the wall has become such an emotional center of Trump's relationship with his political base — and such a symbol of antipathy towards the President for those who oppose him — that it's become an insoluble issue.\n\nAnd government workers are paying the price.\n\n\"The bottom line is there is no excuse for the political stunt just because the President had made a commitment when he ran for office and afterwards,\" said Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, in a CNN interview.\n\n\"He cannot get it done and deliver for his constituency. He should just stand up and say I tried and let's get on with the next thing,\" said Bloomberg, a possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. \"There's no one issue or one constituency. The President has not been elected to be the representative of a party, or of a small group, he's supposed to be representative of a whole country.\"\n\nSo far, Trump has held off on his threat to declare a national emergency and reprogram Pentagon funds — possibly from disaster relief projects in Puerto Rico and Texas — to finance his wall.\n\nSuch a step might allow him to declare a victory that most people will believe to be hollow. He might be able to sell his supporters on a battle in the courts after an almost certain legal challenge and reap political capital.\n\nBut it would also represent a fundamental flouting of constitutional governance, since a future president, thwarted by Congress fulfilling its core task of deciding how taxpayer money is spent, could choose to go ahead with a favorite political project regardless.\n\nHypocrisy\n\nThe failure of Congress to unpick the deadlock has disgusted some of its most venerable members.\n\n\"How can we resolve this? We owe it to the American people. This is like a circus,\" Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama said earlier in the week.\n\nMcConnell has refused to act on Democratic House bills to open various government agencies, since Trump will not agree to sign them.\n\nFor now, McConnell has no desire to open cracks in the Republican coalition by breaking with a President who has leveraged his devoted base to punish any dissidents in his party.\n\nThere could come a time, however, when clear discomfort among some GOP members, like Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, Alaska's Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Maine's Sen. Susan Collins, begins to make life uncomfortable for McConnell.\n\nThe bitterness of shutdown politics has also revealed a seam of hypocrisy that festers on both sides of the aisle in this fractured political age.\n\nIn 2016, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham signed on to an amicus brief in a Supreme Court case challenging President Barack Obama's use of executive power to shield recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program from deportation.\n\nThe document complained that Obama's move was an attempt to supplant Congress' power and a threat to the constitutional principle of separation of powers. Those norms seem less important to the South Carolinian now Trump is in the White House.\n\n\"Mr. President, Declare a national emergency NOW. Build a wall NOW,\" Graham tweeted on Friday after meeting Trump.\n\nPart of Graham's frustration stems from his belief that Democrats are hypocrites for refusing to contemplate immigration enforcement policies that they have favored in the past.\n\nEarly last year, Democrats and the White House appeared close to a deal that would have given Trump $25 billion in border security in return for a path to citizenship for DACA recipients — undocumented migrants brought to the US illegally as children.\n\nTrump eventually pulled out of the deal.\n\nThe idea of border fencing, or a wall in some areas, has not been so radioactive for Democrats in the past.\n\nIn 2006, Democrats including now-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and then-Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama voted to authorize a secure fence along about 700 miles of the US-Mexico border.\n\nThe project was far from the concrete or steel wall envisioned by Trump.\n\nBut given the symbolic potency of the idea of a wall, it's not clear Democrats — who do not want their first act in the majority in the House to be a concession to Trump, would contemplate any such plan today.",

        "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump 's nominee to become the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told senators Thursday that if confirmed, he \"will not be intimidated into making stupid decisions\" and pledged to provide the best military advice regardless of consequences to himself.\n\nCurrent Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley offered that particularly blunt response during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee where he fielded several questions about how he would function as the President's principal military adviser and handle the pressure of delivering his own opinions in the Oval Office.\n\nIf confirmed, Milley will succeed outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Joseph Dunford, to become the highest-ranking military officer in the country and principal military adviser to the president.\n\nHe would take over the job at a time when the Trump administration faces a myriad of geopolitical threats, including increasing tensions with Iran, as well as, challenges from rivals like China and Russia.\n\nThere are also concerns about the lack of permanent appointees at the Pentagon.\n\nPerhaps the most notable exchange occurred with Milley was asked by Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, whether he would be intimidated by anyone.\n\nMilley answered bluntly: \"Absolutely not. By no one, ever.\"\n\n\"I'll give my best military advice, it will be candid, it will be honest, it will be rigorous and thorough and that's what I will do every single time,\" he said.\n\nKing pressed Milley on the issue, noting that he is confident the four-star general will assert his views, even if they run counter to the opinion of the President, but felt it was important to emphasize that point.\n\n\"I believe that I think it's very important to emphasize, the Oval Office is an intimidating place. The president of the United States is the most powerful leader in the free world and to be willing to say Mr. President you are wrong about this or this is the consequences if it's something that he or she doesn't want to hear is just, there is no more important responsibility in your career that you will have had to make that statement,\" King said.\n\n\"Senator, and I would say it applies to Gen. Dunford and most of us who have seen a lot of combat, we buried these soldiers. Arlington is full of our comrades and we understand absolutely full well the hazards of our chosen profession, we know what this is about and we are not going to be intimidated into making stupid decisions,\" Milley responded.\n\n\"We will give our best military advice regardless of consequences to our self,\" he added.\n\nEarlier in the hearing, Hawaii Democrat Sen. Mazie Hirono asked Milley under what conditions he would resign from his position if his advice and counsel on major policy issues were not being heeded.\n\n\"I think it would be a function of something that was illegal, unethical or immoral. That's what I've been brought up with since I was second lieutenant and that would probably be cause for resignation,\" Milley answered, noting he would expect the same from any US service member, no matter their rank.\n\nThat line of questioning prompted some push back from Republican Sen. Tom Cotton who attempted to draw a distinction between an illegal and unwise order.\n\n\"So what the president should expect from you, what the secretary of defense should expect of you, what the nation expects from you is you always give your professional best military judgment?\" Cotton asked.\n\n\"That's correct. Always,\" Milley said.\n\nAsked if he will \"then implement lawful orders even if you disagree with them personally or think they might be ill-advised,\" Milley answered: \"Absolutely.\"\n\nTrump tapped Milley to be the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs last December. CNN previously reported that he interviewed with Trump for the position on November 14 for more than an hour.\n\nMilley who holds degrees from Princeton University and Columbia University, is known to be liked by Trump. He has commanded units with the 10th Mountain Division and the 101st Airborne and served multiple combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAfter becoming chief of staff of the Army in 2015, Milley helped oversee the army's transition away from large-scale counterinsurgency campaigns in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, focusing instead on near-peer challenges from Russia and China.\n\nHe helped launch the Army's Security Force Assistance Brigades to help reduce the strain on Special Forces units while also ensuring that the army maintained the ability to advise friendly forces combating extremist groups.\n\nMilley was also involved in the launch of Army Futures Command which is tasked with helping modernize the service.",

        "text": "(CNN) President Donald Trump, in a closed door meeting Tuesday with Senate Republicans, again took a swipe at Puerto Rico's fiscal management and the size of its disaster relief in the wake of damaging storms last week -- and he brought a visual aid to try and back up his point, according to senators in the room.\n\nTrump, as part of broader remarks that touched on everything from special counsel Robert Mueller's report and health care to trade and North Korea, went out of his way to point out the totals of disaster relief aid that has been distributed in the wake of a series of storms and hurricanes in 2017. It is an issue Trump has had for months -- mentioning Puerto Rico's finances and total disaster relief in negative terms repeatedly in meetings with lawmakers and staff as they've worked through iterations of the next disaster relief bill.\n\n\"The point was -- are we spending the money wisely?\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican asked. \"I have nothing against helping the people of Puerto Rico, but we have got to spend the money wisely.\"\n\nTrump, senators said, then utilized a chart to showed the difference between what Puerto Rico has received compared to other states like Texas and Florida. At one point, Trump noted that Puerto Rico has received more than $90 billion in aid. Congressional officials asked about the total mentioned by Trump that didn't track with what Congress has provided in aid up to this point.\n\n\"He just talked about the sum total of it,\" Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, told reporters of Trump's Puerto Rico riff.\n\nRead More",

        "text": "San Juan, Puerto Rico (CNN) One year ago, Maria came to Puerto Rico like a chainsaw in the sky, one hundred miles wide.\n\nOn the island, The Maria Generation will remember it as 9/20, a vivid example that few things test a society's values like a massive disaster.\n\nWhile earthquakes and volcanoes give no warning, a hurricane can be a slow-motion stress test of national strength, smarts and cohesion.\n\nWhen the winds die and the clouds part, failure to prepare or respond becomes impossible to ignore. How a country counts its dead and measures its losses will shape the way it braces for the next big, bad day.\n\nMiguel Olivera, a combat veteran, here with his wife Diana Aponte, was down to his last vial of insulin after Hurricane Maria.\n\nAs proof of the chaos that followed Maria, the governor's official body count jumped more than 4,500% in a single day, from 64 to 2,975 . I met dozens on the island who believe that number is too low, even as President Trump tweeted his conspiracy theory that it is too high , inflated by political enemies to make him look bad.\n\n\"There is something evil in him,\" Diana Aponte said when I read her the tweet. \"People are still dying as a consequence of Maria. How could he doubt it? He's heartless. He's worthless.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump pumps his fists after arriving in Puerto Rico last October.\n\nLaid low by the stress of the storm, lack of medicine and generator fumes, Diana's husband, Miguel, died on their 50th wedding anniversary , two months after the storm. She shrugs when I ask if he should be counted as a storm fatality and says she rejected FEMA's offer to pay for Miguel's casket. For her, the bigger issues are respect for the dead and lessons learned.\n\nDiana Aponte looks at a memorial to her husband, who died two months after the storm.\n\nSo in honor of Miguel and all those victims whose names we may never know, here is how human nature supercharged the destruction of Mother Nature in Puerto Rico.\n\nFood and water\n\nOn a good day, you can drive the width of Puerto Rico in under three hours.\n\nAfter Maria brought down countless power poles and hillsides, it could take three days.\n\nSupplies are carried to a makeshift ladder after a bridge collapse in Utuado.\n\nWith over 3 million people running out of food and water , the shattered island desperately needed air support. The Feds would eventually fly a record 5,373 sorties, but many towns furthest from San Juan didn't see help for weeks.\n\nAs a point of comparison, the United States had 22,000 troops, more than 30 ships and some 300 helicopters on the island of Haiti, two weeks after the 2010 earthquake.\n\nBut when I landed at an abandoned airport in Mayaguez one month after Maria, the National Guard was just beginning to arrive, while a handful of volunteer combat vets from the mainland had already fed and watered thousands after flying down on their own dime.\n\nVolunteer first responder Eric Carlson said more people were needed to help after the storm.\n\n\"I think we're up to 30,000 meals, 35,000 meals,\" a weary Eric Carlson told me in baggage claim-turned-bunkhouse. \"And that just with the small trucks we have, and by hook and by crook getting supplies.\"\n\nWhile Carlson was calling for more manpower, Justo Hernandez, FEMA's second in command in Puerto Rico, said that he was set. \"I have 17,000 people on the island,\" he told me. An internal FEMA investigation would later reveal that after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit the mainland, more than half of these people were \"bottom of the barrel\" -- untrained, unqualified and many not bilingual.\n\n\"I don't know how much more we can bring in without actually impacting the economy of Puerto Rico,\" Hernandez said at the one-month mark. \"If I keep on flooding the place with food and water, when is it that the local neighbors are going to open their supermarket?\"\n\nBut in the months that followed, FEMA would flood Puerto Rico with supplies, and the proof can now be found sitting on a runway in Ceiba . We found more than 20,000 pallets, holding millions of bottles of fresh water, going to waste in the sun for months.\n\nStacks upon stacks of bottled water sit near a runway in Ceiba this month.\n\nAfter initially blaming local officials for failing to distribute it, Hernandez admits they simply shipped too much, too late.\n\n\"We are investigating how we got to this stage,\" he told me. \"Because that's a big lesson learned for us.\"\n\nPower\n\nNative Puerto Ricans -- the hearty \"Boricuas\" -- are used to blackouts.\n\nWhile American power stations and transmission lines are usually updated every decade, Puerto Rico's power grid had been neglected for decades before Maria tore it to pieces.\n\nA power tower toppled by the hurricane still lies on top of a house in San Juan, Puerto Rico on November 7, 2017.\n\nWith $9 billion in debt, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) was often derided as a symbol of mismanagement, and the storm did little to change that perception.\n\nWhitefish brought in equipment and specialized workers -- and controversy, too.\n\nThe two-year-old company had only two listed employees, but they had a barge full of journeymen, linemen and equipment impossible to find after Harvey and Irma -- and more importantly, Ramos says, they didn't ask the bankrupt utility for any payment up front.\n\nWhen word got out that the last-minute deal would pay many times the going rate for men and equipment, a public outcry led to the firing of Whitefish and the resignation of Ramos, while the job of rebuilding the grid went to the Army Corps of Engineers. \"It's not something we even planned on doing in any kind of disaster,\" said chief engineer Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite. \"We don't do grid repair.\"\n\nLt. Gen. Todd Semonite references a map of Puerto Rico's electric transmission grid -- the rebuilding of which his organization had to take on.\n\nBefore leaving the island, the fired Whitefish Energy crews managed to repair five transmission lines faster and cheaper than other contractors, PREPA records show, and were given a \"favorable review\" by FEMA's Inspector General and PREPA's new chief, José Ortiz.\n\n\"I don't think we were prepared,\" Ortiz said. \"We didn't realize we needed to have inventory and manufacturers identified for a major catastrophe like this. There was a lot of mismanagement.\"\n\nCar lights are seen in a powerless neighborhood of Utuado, three weeks after the hurricane.\n\nOrtiz says that when the next storm hits, he has mutual aid contracts with 32 contractors already in place.\n\nShelter\n\nWhen Maria hit, there wasn't a single cot or tarp in FEMA warehouses. They'd all been sent to the Virgin Islands in response to Hurricane Irma.\n\n\"Operation Blue Roof\" was supposed to fill some of that gap and provide the one thing most people needed after food and water: shelter from a wet tropical sky.\n\nA contractor helps apply a FEMA tarp to a home in Morovis on December 20.\n\nFEMA distributed nearly 170,000 tarps for self-installation, but in the first three months after the storm, 70,000 people signed up to have a sturdy tarp installed by the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nIn December, 20,000 tarp rolls sat idle in this government warehouse. Another depot had 40,000 more.\n\nThe mission manager blamed difficult working conditions and unsafe structures while, in November, FEMA fired a Florida company called Bronze Star, which had been hired to deliver tarps to the island. \"Formed by two brothers in August, Bronze Star had never before won a government contract or delivered tarps or plastic sheeting,\" the Associated Press reported\n\nFlying over the island today, the blue tarps can be seen everywhere. What are supposed to be temporary fixes are now tattered and fading in the sun as the island struggles to rebuild.\n\nThe ubiquitous blue tarps cover houses visible from the expressway in the town of Canóvanas this week.\n\nHarder to see is the emotional toll brought by approaching storms under broken roofs.\n\nHow it all adds up\n\nAfter CNN sued the Puerto Rico Department of Health to see a mortality database, we could see in black and white how the months-long lack of clean water, shelter and power created a slow motion disaster that only added to the body count.\n\nAfter months of broken water mains and powerless pumps, there was an outbreak of deadly leptospirosis , caused by drinking water tainted with animal waste.\n\nMany Puerto Ricans had no option but to gather water from mountain springs and rivers after the storm, despite the health risks.\n\nDoctors were forced to operate in dark, hot, unsterile hospitals. For some relying on breathing machines or dialysis, running out of generator gas meant the difference between life or death -- which is why the scientists at George Washington University said the old and poor make up the brunt of the 2,975 excess deaths in the six months after the storm.\n\n\"Any time FEMA is the first responder and the primary responder like we were in Puerto Rico, it's never an ideal situation,\" FEMA head Brock Long told me in November. \"But I do believe that we kept that island from complete and total collapse.\"\n\nAlana Rivera, age 10, does her daily homework in her apartment balcony lit by a cell phone light in San Juan, last November.\n\nLocal officials from Vieques to Utuado bristled when I shared his quote. If you want a lesson in self-sufficiency, come to Puerto Rico, they say. Because over a century after becoming property of the United States, they have no choice but to scrape by -- a Caribbean colony, paying taxes without representation in Congress and voting only for presidential primaries.\n\nA FEMA report reviewed by PBS Frontline shows that nine days after their respective storms, Texas and Florida had received twice as much water and four times the food and tarps as Puerto Rico.\n\nPuerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló was hesitant to criticize President Trump or the federal response in the weeks after Hurricane Maria.\n\n\"In terms of the response, in terms of the unnecessary bureaucracy, in terms of the lack of urgency, for example, of the Corps of Engineers, it is likely that being an American territory and being second class citizens is playing a huge role,\" Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told me. Like his father, a two-term governor of Puerto Rico, Rosselló is among the long line of leaders who argue the island deserves statehood.\n\nOver the last century, Puerto Ricans died in American wars, played on American ballfields and stages, and made an awful lot of American medicine.\n\nDo they need their own star on the flag to be treated like Texas or Florida?",

        "text": "President Donald Trump claims that “Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane” and that it received “more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before.” Neither of those statements is true.\n\nAccording to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as of the end of last year, Puerto Rico had actually received about $11.2 billion in disaster relief payments since 2017.\n\nIn all, the federal government has allocated nearly $41 billion, and has obligated about half of it via binding agreements, but as we said, so far just a portion of that — $11.2 billion — has been distributed in Puerto Rico.\n\nTo get to the $91 billion figure, a senior administration official told us Trump is including the total allocation for Puerto Rico — $41 billion — plus an estimated $50 billion in future FEMA costs “over the life of the disaster,” which can stretch decades.\n\n“It is accurate to say that $41 billion has been allocated and there will likely be billions more,” Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us via email. “But to just add up actual appropriations (most of which has not actually [been] obligated, much less cash on the ground) to some future cost estimates seems inaccurate to me.”\n\nThe president is also wrong to say Puerto Rico got “more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before.” The federal government spent more on Hurricane Katrina aid.\n\nTrump’s claim — which he made via a tweet — came as Republicans and Democrats butt heads on disaster aid proposals, with Democrats seeking more aid for Puerto Rico, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017.\n\nPuerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, & all their local politicians do is complain & ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, & only take from USA…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019\n\n….The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump. So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted. Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019\n\nTrump has used this $91 billion figure before. He cited it in a meeting with Republican senators on March 26, and again on March 28, telling reporters, “I’ve taken better care of Puerto Rico than any man ever. We have $91 billion going to Puerto Rico. We have $29 billion to Texas and $12 billion to Florida for the hurricanes.”\n\nWe asked the White House how Trump arrived at the $91 billion figure, and a senior administration official broke it down to us like this: $14 billion in FEMA allocations to date, plus $26 billion in non-FEMA allocations — for a total of $41 billion allocated for Puerto Rico disaster relief.\n\nFor more details, the official pointed us to FEMA’s Spending Explorer website, which allows users to track disaster aid by state appropriated in 2017 and 2018. It tracks spending in three categories: allocated (which means Congress has appropriated the funds), obligated (which means the government has entered a binding agreement to award funding), and outlayed (which means the money has actually been paid).\n\nAs we said, the FEMA calculator shows only $11.2 billion of the $41 billion allocated for Puerto Rico disaster relief has been paid so far. (We should note that not all disaster relief going to Puerto Rico is directly tied to Hurricane Maria. The appropriations also include relief from Hurricane Irma, which was much less severe for Puerto Rico, but which also caused some damage.)\n\nBut to get to $91 billion, the senior administration official told us, the president is also adding $50 billion, the “estimated future FEMA costs over the life of the disaster.” The official referred us to a report from the Washington Post Fact Checker that said the $50 billion was “an internal Office of Management and Budget estimate of the potential liabilities over the life of the disaster that would need to be committed under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988,” which governs federal disaster response in the U.S. The Post added that the estimate “was described as a high-end estimate subject to change year by year.”\n\n“Stafford Act claims can be paid out for decades, and future claims are very difficult to quantify,” a House Appropriations Committee spokesperson told us.\n\nPost-disaster federal funding comes from two main sources, the Disaster Relief Fund and supplemental appropriations, according to Ellis. By the end of 2019, FEMA estimates that a little less than $21 billion will have gone to Puerto Rico from the Disaster Relief Fund as a result of Maria (with another $3.6 billion going to the Virgin Islands).\n\nBy comparison, FEMA to date has spent more than $50 billion from the Disaster Relief Fund as a result of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, including $32.6 billion to Louisiana. Ellis notes that nearly $200 million in Katrina-related disaster aid will come from the relief fund this year, “which gives you an idea of how long these funds trickle in.”\n\nThe appropriated funds are harder to track, Ellis said. In addition to Katrina, there were two other major storms in the U.S. in 2005, Rita and Wilma. And in addition to Maria, Hurricane Irma made landfall the same year in 2017. The funds for multiple storms can go into the same accounts, making it hard to track aid for particular storms.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service estimates that, in all, “Congress provided roughly $120 billion for Hurricane Katrina.” So even if the president’s long-term cost estimate for Puerto Rico pans out, it would still be less than what was spent by the federal government on Katrina.\n\nComparing money allocated after storms also needs to account for the severity of the storms, and how much damage they cause.\n\nAlthough the federal spending for disaster relief in Florida and Texas has been lower, as the president noted, those storms also caused less damage than Maria did in Puerto Rico.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal BMJ Global Health on Jan. 18, “the federal government responded on a larger scale and much more quickly across measures of federal money and staffing to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in Texas and Florida, compared with Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. The variation in the responses was not commensurate with storm severity and need after landfall in the case of Puerto Rico compared with Texas and Florida.”",

Generally, that criterion is a low pressure that drops 24 millibars (a unit of pressure) in 24 hours.\n\nBut that benchmark also is based on the storm's latitude, and at Colorado's latitude, this storm needed to drop only around 18 millibars in 24 hours, which it did, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nTraffic backs up Wednesday in Denver.\n\nStay off the roads, drivers are warned\n\nIn some states, getting from one point to another will be a nightmare.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Nebraska said travel will be almost impossible until Friday morning, using language nearly mirrored by offices throughout the region.\n\nIn South Dakota, the sheriff's departments of Deuel and Hamlin counties asked people to refrain from driving through the area Thursday as the blizzard shut down parts of interstates.\n\n\"Roads are becoming impassable. Unless you are experiencing an emergency, please stay off the roads,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nSouth Dakota Gov.

Jared Polis activated the state's national guard to help stranded motorists.\n\nTemperature plummet precedes flood and fire risks\n\nBy Wednesday, snow was falling. Earlier this week, Denver had been basking in springlike conditions , with 78 degrees Tuesday, a near-record high for that date.By Wednesday, snow was falling.\n\nAnd the Minneapolis/St. Paul area, which also enjoyed warmth this week, could soon see up to 5 inches of snow.\n\nA dog is seen peeking over a chain link fence during a blizzard warning hitting southeast Wyoming on Wednesday.\n\nThe fresh snowfall could lead to additional flooding in the region.\n\nIn South Dakota and western Minnesota, rivers will see moderate to major flooding as additional snow will slow the rate at which waters recede.\n\nThe Red River is experiencing significant flooding because of melting snow, with this new storm likely prolonging the high water.\n\nA United Airlines plane is deiced before taking off from Denver International Airport on Wednesday.\n\nA warmer section of the storm, meanwhile, brings a slight risk of severe thunderstorms Thursday to parts of Illinois and Indiana.\n\nIn Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds urged residents to make preparations for flooding.\n\nSouth of the blizzard, wind gusts and dry conditions will pose wildfire threats Thursday in parts of southern Arizona, southern New Mexico, West Texas and southwestern Missouri.\n\nOn Wednesday, winds gusted as high as 75 mph -- right at hurricane strength -- in New Mexico, CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said.

That vote was 44-49. The second measure that came up for a vote was a relief measure that passed out of the Democratic-controlled House months ago. Republicans criticized that legislation for not providing relief for recent flooding that has devastated the Midwest. That vote was 46-48.\n\nThe failure of both measures will send lawmakers back to the drawing board in search of a compromise that can pass.

The legislation includes $600 million to pay for nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico.\n\nDemocrats opposed the Republican Senate proposal in part, because they argue it does not include enough aid for hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico.

        "text": "President Donald Trump, during a closed door meeting with Republicans last week, reportedly said that Puerto Rico was getting too much storm funding. | Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images white house Senate fails to advance disaster aid package amid Puerto Rico clash\n\nCongress hit a logjam Monday in the months-long quest to deliver aid to disaster-wrought states after President Donald Trump jumped into the fray with complaints that too much federal cash is flowing to Puerto Rico.\n\nThe Senate shot down test votes on two competing plans for delivering at least $13 billion in aid to communities hit by hurricanes, wildfires and catastrophic flooding in recent months. Senators voted 44-49 in rejecting the Republican proposal and 46-48 in shooting down the version the Democratic-led House passed in January.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile it is unclear what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will decide to do now with the stalled bill negotiations are expected to continue behind the scenes as lawmakers work to strike a compromise that would send billions of dollars in relief to many of their states.\n\nThe failure of both proposals came just a few hours after the president demanded on Twitter that Senate Democrats support the GOP plan crafted by Georgia Republican Sen. David Perdue. “They are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural America!” Trump tweeted.\n\nNegotiations around disaster aid hit a snag last week, after Democrats told Republicans they would not back Perdue’s package unless it matched the House-passed plan on money for Puerto Rico, which was devastated by two hurricanes in 2017. Trump, during a closed-door meeting with Republicans last week, reportedly said Puerto Rico was getting too much storm funding.\n\nSenate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said on the Senate floor Monday night that Democrats are “unwilling to help” disaster victims “unless their demands are met.” Congress already gave Puerto Rico billions of dollars last year in aid, much of which the U.S. territory has yet to spend, he said.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer noted in an op-ed over the weekend that the Trump administration has yet to disperse nearly $20 billion of that previous recovery aid to Puerto Rico.\n\nThe one “glaring difference” between the plans the Senate voted on Monday night, Shelby said, is that the Republican version includes money for disasters that have hit this year, including aid for Southern and Midwestern states affected by recent severe flooding.\n\nVoting against the GOP plan put Senate Democrats running for president in a tough position since Iowa is among the states that would benefit from the disaster aid package. All of the Democratic 2020 candidates opposed the Republican plan except Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who was not present.\n\n“To my colleagues across the aisle who have been spending a lot of time in Iowa lately as presidential candidates — if you vote against moving forward ... how are you going to look Iowans in the eye?\" Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) asked prior to the vote.\n\nSenate Democrats plan to introduce new legislation Tuesday, however, that would provide billions of dollars in new disaster funding for communities affected by the Midwest floods and other natural disasters this year, including Iowa, according to a senior Senate Democratic aide. The Senate Appropriations Committee's top Democrat, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), has also filed an amendment to that effect.\n\nThe House-passed version did not include that money because the Midwest storms had not yet hit when the House passed its bill.\n\nDemocrats chided Senate GOP leaders for ditching some of the funding for Puerto Rico that the House included in its version. The feud over aid for the territory has only been exacerbated by Trump’s involvement, given the president’s history of feuding with leaders of the U.S. territory.\n\n“The administration’s response to Puerto Rico can be summed up in two words: cruel, nasty,” Schumer said on the floor Monday night.\n\nThe stall in negotiations comes as some communities have waited months for aid. Recent natural disasters have also complicated the process. Perdue, along with several senators including Democratic Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama, introduced the $13 billion disaster relief package in February. Last week, Shelby introduced an amendment that expanded Perdue’s bill to include eligibility for disaster relief for Midwestern and Southern states. The bill also includes $600 million in nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico.\n\nBut Democrats say it’s not enough. Leahy introduced his own amendment last week that would require that the Department of Housing and Urban Development release grant funds already allocated to the island.\n\nAhead of the vote, McConnell said on the floor that Shelby’s amendment “is the only game in town,\" since it is the \"only bill on the table with any provision for the Midwest flooding and is the only bill on the table that could earn a presidential signature in time to deliver urgent relief on the nutrition assistance needed in Puerto Rico.”\n\nOver the weekend, Puerto Rico’s Gov. Ricardo Rosselló urged the Senate to pass the House-passed bill, which he said, \"provides much-needed support to Puerto Rico in addressing critical infrastructure, education, nutritional, and housing needs on the island.\" He added that the Shelby amendment “falls short of addressing the majority of our most pressing needs.”\n\nFollowing Trump’s tweet, Perdue praised the president for his support and blasted Democrats for the delay.\n\n“It’s unacceptable that Washington’s intransigence continues to threaten the livelihoods of the very people who sent us here to represent them,” Perdue said in a statement. “Every day we continue debating disaster relief is a day people across the country face crippling uncertainty.”\n\nCaitlin Emma contributed to this report.\n\n",

        "text": "\"We have people counting on that,” said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose state has relied on decades of mammoth Army Corps projects to drive much of its economic growth. | Joe Raedle/Getty Images defense Bipartisan blowback hits idea of tapping Army Corps for wall money\n\nElected leaders across the political spectrum expressed unease Friday at the prospect of President Donald Trump paying for his border wall using money siphoned from the Army Corps of Engineers, which could tap billions of dollars targeted to disaster relief or lawmakers’ home-state water projects.\n\nThe reaction came swiftly from politicians as disparate as Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Trump ally, and California Democratic Rep. John Garamendi, who accused the White House of seeking to punish his blue-leaning state. And it served as a reminder that Trump might create as many political headaches as he solves if he tries to bypass Congress by declaring a national emergency in pursuit of the wall — an option he appeared to distance himself from Friday.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Army Corps, which has military leaders but a mostly civilian workforce, oversees congressionally approved projects throughout the country — from reconstructing dams and dredging canals to trying to restore Florida’s Everglades and Louisiana’s swiftly eroding coastal marshes. But its money is not limitless: Its regular civil works budget is about $6 billion a year, slightly more than what Trump is demanding for the wall. And lawmakers throughout Capitol Hill are fierce guardians of that cash.\n\n\"We have people counting on that,” said DeSantis, whose state has relied on decades of mammoth Army Corps projects to drive much of its economic growth. He added that if the administration does tap the Corps’ budget, it should be returned as soon as the federal government is reopened.\n\n“If they backfill it immediately after the government opens, that's fine, but I don't want that to be where that money is not available to us,” he said.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe Corps also has nearly $14 billion of unspent money out of a pot of $17 billion that Congress gave the agency last year for recovery from disasters such as California’s wildfires and hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Administration officials identified $5 billion of that cash as a potential source of wall funding, Garamendi said based on a list his office had obtained — but it would only drain from aid to California and Puerto Rico, he contended.\n\n“Gee, let me think about that for a while: Why would they target California and Puerto Rico?” asked Garamendi, who serves on the House committee that oversees the Corps. “Puerto Rico — the president has had nothing but scorn for Puerto Rico. And for California, he correctly believes that California is at war with him. So maybe it’s payback time.”\n\nGaramendi would not say how he obtained the list of targeted disaster projects but said he was confident it was accurate and had been presented to Trump.\n\nHe said the plan presented to the White House would spare projects in Texas, Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina. Instead, he said, it would steer money away from efforts to raise the height of the Folsom Dam in Northern California and build flood protections along southern San Francisco’s shoreline, among others.\n\n\"The bottom line of it is, these are very real, necessary projects that Congress, over a period of time, has said must be built,” Garamendi said.\n\nGaramendi said another targeted California project — meant to shore up Lake Isabella to withstand damage from earthquakes — sits just upstream of the Bakersfield district of House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nThe White House said Friday that diverting disaster is money not currently on the table.\n\n\"The President met with leadership of the Army Corps of Engineers to discuss methods of construction for the barriers along the southern border, but they did not discuss, and there are no plans to take money from disaster relief funding to pay for any potential projects,\" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said late Friday.\n\nHours earlier, Trump said he’s not rushing to declare an emergency. (And if he did, it might not even end the shutdown.)\n\n“It's the easy way out but Congress should do this,\" Trump said during a roundtable discussion on border security at the White House. He added: “What we're not looking to do right now is national emergency. I'm not going to do it so fast.”\n\nEven after he spoke, the office of Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) sent out a statement essentially warning against messing with his state’s recovery from Hurricane Harvey, a massive deluge that swamped the Houston area in 2017.\n\n“I will oppose any reprogramming of Harvey disaster funds,” Cornyn said in the statement. “We worked very hard to make sure that the victims of Hurricane Harvey — their concerns are addressed and Texas is able to rebuild.”\n\nCornyn wasn’t the only key Republican raising concerns.\n\n\"Of course, I think it’s a bad idea to declare a national emergency,\" said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), a senior appropriator. \"If he can do it here, the next president can do it over climate change, or something.\"\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, were looking for ways to block such any such effort. Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-Calif.), who’s in line to chair a key subcommittee, said her panel would call in the Corps’ top military commander, Army Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, to testify if Trump moved ahead with the plan.\n\n“We are researching both legislative and/or legal options, but I have no conclusion 'cause we don’t know exactly what he’s going to do yet,” House Transportation Chairman Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), whose committee oversees the Army Corps, told reporters.\n\nFederal law allows the Defense secretary to halt funding for “Army civil works that he deems not essential to the national defense” during a national emergency and instead use the funds for “civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense.” But DeFazio argued that the Corps’ budget does not have any fat, pointing out that the agency already faces a $40 billion backlog on projects involving dams, levees, locks for commerce and dredging in ports.\n\n“To take money from the Corps for a wasteful and ineffective wall when they are already underfunded to meet the real needs of the American people is a travesty,” DeFazio said.\n\nTrump wouldn’t be the first president to feel the blowback from lawmakers’ fierce attachment to Corps projects, which affect every congressional district. In late 2007, former President George W. Bush suffered his first congressional veto override after he tried to reject a sprawling bill authorizing billions of dollars in Corps projects.\n\nMultiple news reports this week have also indicated that the Trump administration was weighing the use of an emergency declaration to tap from military construction funds, which are separate from the Army Corps’ civil works budget. But that strategy would raise its own obstacles, including questions about whether it would represent a step toward politicizing the military.\n\nIn recent decades, the emergency use of that money has almost exclusively been to support military operations overseas or to beef up domestic defenses in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. It “has been used a dozen or more times in the past couple of decades, mostly associated with the global war on terrorism and the 9/11 declaration of emergency,” said John Conger, who oversaw military installations in the Obama administration.\n\nIn addition to setting a perhaps troubling precedent, invoking Trump’s military authority for the wall effort could paradoxically complicate efforts to get the barrier built speedily. That’s because military construction projects have a notorious reputation for being bogged down in government bureaucracy — much like the Army Corps’ civil projects, which are rarely noted for blazing speed.\n\nFor one thing, the Pentagon would probably have to conduct a thorough environmental assessment before breaking any ground for the wall.\n\n“Every time you do a military construction project, you have to do an assessment of the environmental implications, and that can be associated with a study that can go for months or years,” said Conger, “and legal challenges to whether you did a sufficient study.”\n\nBob Hale, a former Pentagon budget chief, said tapping the military construction budget could harm readiness.\n\n“We all think of [military construction] as housing and things like that, but a lot of it is very mission-related,” he said. “I mean, building hangars for F-35s ... and many other facilities. My guess is the department will try to avoid delaying those projects if they can.”\n\nAnthony Adragna, Matt Dixon, Connor O’Brien and Wesley Morgan contributed to this report.",

It was largely -- you know, it was largely closed.\"\n\nAs Hurricane Florence approached, President Donald Trump relied on his track record to assure the public his administration is ready.\n\n\"I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success,\" Trump told reporters on Sept. 11.\n\nPuerto Rico recovered full power in August, 11 months after Hurricane Maria. Trump attributed the struggle to the territory’s floundering power system.\n\n\"Puerto Rico got hit not with one hurricane but with two (hurricanes),\" Trump said. \"And the problem with Puerto Rico is their electric grid and their electric generating plant was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in very bad shape. It was in bankruptcy. It had no money. It was largely — you know, it was largely closed.\"\n\n\"And when the storm hit, they had no electricity — essentially before the storm,\" Trump said. \"And when the storm hit, that took it out entirely.\"\n\nWas the power system dead on arrival? Trump is exaggerating. The White House pointed to the power grid’s state of disrepair.\n\nFirst, there’s a difference between the electric grid and generating plants. Plants produce electricity using fossil fuels or renewable energies, while the grid ensures that power gets to the areas that need it.\n\nJorge Carmacho, a senior policy advisor at Urban Ingenuity who assessed the electric infrastructure damages after the hurricanes for the government of Puerto Rico, estimated roughly 30 percent of the generating plants were not operational before the storm hit. He identified two reasons.\n\nOne is non-compliance with Environmental Protection Agency rules, which set limits on fossil fuel burning. The other was maintenance, propagated by unprecedented oversight by Puerto Rico’s recently created Energy Commission.\n\nOne of the main issues they were trying to fix was the grid, which Trump also mentioned. It is run by PREPA, a government utilities program, which is bankrupt, as Trump said. It faces $9 billion of debt.\n\nTrump was right in saying it was in very bad shape. But it wasn’t dead or closed.\n\nBefore the hurricanes hit, all customers were being serviced, according to James Gallagher, executive director of New York State Smart Grid Consortium, which is working to stabilize Puerto Rico’s grid. About 10 to 15 percent of customers lost power after the first hurricane, Irma.\n\nBut coverage was spotty even before the hurricanes. In 2016, for example, a fire resulted in a three-day blackout. The consulting firm Synapse Energy Economics estimated that on average, customers face a power outage every three months.\n\n\"PREPA was in bankruptcy,\" Carmacho said. \"That’s true. But were they pushing electrons to people so they could turn on the lights? Yes. Was it reliable? No. it hasn’t been reliable in 20 years. We might have an outage every three days. That has been the norm.\"\n\nThe bulk of Puerto Rico’s generating plants are located in the southern part of the island, while consumption is mostly in the north. The complex system that transfers energy from one side to the other forms its Achilles heel during climate disasters like this one, according to Marla Perez Lugo, a sociologist at the University of Puerto Rico focusing on energy policy.\n\nUnlike in the United States, where an outage in Ohio can be fixed by connecting to the grid in Illinois, an island electric system relies on reserves, on which Puerto Rico falls short, according to Carmacho.\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump said \"Puerto Rico’s electric grid and their electric generating plant was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in very bad shape. It was in bankruptcy. It had no money. It was largely -- you know, it was largely closed.\"\n\nSome electric generating plants, not the majority, were inoperative before the storm hit due to maintenance work. The grid was servicing all customers but had important vulnerabilities.\n\nTrump's statement is partially accurate.

        "text": "“Trump noted to GOP senators that Texas — also battered by a spate of hurricanes — was awarded $29 billion in aid, while South Carolina got $1.5 billion to recover from storms. Trump then questioned why Puerto Rico was getting $91 billion, according to two people familiar with his comments, indicating that this was too much compared with compensation for states on the mainland.”\n\n— The Washington Post, March 26, 2019\n\nPresident Trump has been complaining about the cost of the recovery effort for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. In a private meeting with Republican senators he tossed out a number — $91 billion.\n\nThe figure is significantly higher than what is known about appropriated funds for Puerto Rico. But administration officials say he has a basis for using it.\n\nLet’s explore.\n\nThe Facts\n\nGetting a full picture on federal government spending for Puerto Rico so far is difficult because it’s spread across different agencies and spending bills. But here’s the best possible estimate we received, as of March 27, after communications with officials in different agencies.\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency: $15 billion obligated ($9.9 billion in outlays)\n\n$15 billion obligated ($9.9 billion in outlays) Army Corps of Engineers: $2.5 billion approved ($3 million in outlays)\n\n$2.5 billion approved ($3 million in outlays) Community Development Block Grants-Disaster Recovery (Housing and Urban Development): $20 billion approved, of which $1.5 billion has been obligated\n\n$20 billion approved, of which $1.5 billion has been obligated Small Business Administration: $1.95 billion for homes/business loans obligated ($1.1 billion in outlays)\n\n$1.95 billion for homes/business loans obligated ($1.1 billion in outlays) Education Department: $710 million obligated ($28 million in outlays)\n\n$710 million obligated ($28 million in outlays) FEMA community disaster loans: $294 million obligated ($128 million in outlays)\n\n$294 million obligated ($128 million in outlays) Various other agencies: $266 million approved (lesser amounts in outlays)\n\nThat adds up to nearly $41 billion in announced funding. But notice words like “obligated” and “outlays”?\n\nHere’s an explanation:\n\nOutlays = money has been delivered\n\n= money has been delivered Obligated = spending has been identified but money not delivered\n\n= spending has been identified but money not delivered Approved = A budget allocation has been made, but money has not been obligated or disbursed.\n\nAbout half of the money scheduled for Puerto Rico comes from the HUD grants. But virtually none of that funding has been spent yet. HUD in July said it had approved spending $1.5 billion but the funds had not been drawn down yet, according to a Government Accountability Office report released this month. About 50 percent has been earmarked for home repair and reconstruction.\n\nA HUD official said Puerto Rico has the $1.5 billion in hand, but has spent just $42,000. “It should take Puerto Rico approximately two to three years to spend the $1.5 billion,” the official said. “Following Superstorm Sandy, the state of New Jersey disbursed $1 billion over the course of two years.”\n\nAnother $8.2 billion of the $20 billion HUD allocation was approved in February but not yet delivered. That still leaves about half of the $20 billion untouched.\n\nIn other words, depending on how you do the math, only about a quarter of the total pot of money has actually been spent on the island — $11.2 billion.\n\nSo how does Trump come up with $91 billion?\n\nOfficials told The Fact Checker that the president was referring to an internal Office of Management and Budget estimate of the potential liabilities over the life of the disaster that would need to be committed under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988. The estimate was described as a high-end estimate subject to change year by year.\n\nCurrently, the estimated Stafford liabilities amount to $50 billion. Adding the $41 billion in announced funding to the $50 billion in Stafford liabilities gets you to $91 billion.\n\nNotice that we said the additional $50 billion was “over the life of a disaster.” That means it’s a long-term figure, beyond the traditional 10-year budget horizon. Indeed, one congressional aide estimated that Stafford payments will continue for 20 years in Puerto Rico. The government is still paying for the damage from Hurricane Katrina almost 14 years after it struck New Orleans.\n\nTexas has been allocated $25 billion, but its estimated Stafford liabilities are much smaller -- just $4 billion, according to the OMB estimate. Together, that adds up to $29 billion.\n\nWhat apparently caught Trump’s attention was the relative scale — with the estimated long-term cost of Puerto Rican repairs potentially three times larger than the cost of Hurricane Harvey in Texas.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nWithout a direct, verified quote, we cannot evaluate the accuracy of the president’s statement. His remarks were interpreted by senators as money already committed or spent. But administration officials said he was talking about future liabilities, especially in relative terms to other recent disasters.\n\nThe president sometimes speaks about future spending as if it’s already taken place. But if he’s comparing various Stafford estimates, it could be reasonable to use 20-year figures as long as he indicated that this did not reflect current obligations.\n\nBut at least now the mystery is solved about the source of the $91 billion number.\n\nUpdate: On March 28, Trump put it this way in remarks to reporters: “We have $91 billion going to Puerto Rico. We have $29 billion to Texas and $12 billion to Florida for the hurricanes.” He did not indicate that he was talking about long-term, 20-year estimates.\n\nUpdate, April 2: In a tweet, the president claimed “Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars.” That’s simply false. As explained above, this is a 20-year estimate subject to change. The island so far has only received about $11 billion.\n\nNo rating\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles\n\nShare the Facts 2019-04-02 13:39:50 UTC Washington Post -1 -1 -1 Washington Post Rating: False Washington Post Rating: \"Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before.\" Donald Trump President https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1113041708730802176 in a tweet Monday, April 2, 2018 2018-04-02 Read More info",

If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 13, 2018\n\nTrump ignores basic facts about reality for Puerto Ricans after Hurricanes Irma and Maria after September 2017. Trump also miscasts the estimate as a Democratic effort when it was created by experts on disaster response.\n\nThere was no \"magic\" to the increase in the death toll estimates. It is based in science.\n\n\"Early after a disaster, death tolls tend to be preliminary,\" said Roberto Rivera, College of Business University of Puerto Rico. \"In the case of Hurricane Maria, indirect deaths are the reason the toll was so high, as suggested by some reports. That's the context that Trump is missing.\"\n\nDeath toll estimates by academics\n\nThe government in Puerto Rico initially reported 16 deaths in September 2017, and raised it to 34 in October and then 64 in December.\n\nBut for months, researchers had said that the government’s official count was an undercount.\n\nPart of a death toll is a count of direct deaths from a storm, such as being struck by a falling tree or drowning in a flood. The more complicated count comes from indirect deaths caused by unsafe or unhealthy conditions, such as someone who relies on a respirator but loses electricity.\n\nUsually, the death toll of an event such as Hurricane Maria is determined through an exam by a medical examiner. But Puerto Rico officials did not have the proper resources to effectively conduct forensic examinations.\n\nWithout complete medical records, researchers were left with other ways to try to come up with an estimate. Multiple studies used different methodologies and time periods, and therefore arrived at different results about \"excess deaths\" — comparing the number of deaths with historical trends during the time period in previous years.\n\nExcess death measurement has been a standard in the measurement of deaths attributable to environmental and climate events since the early 1960s, said Alexis Santos-Lozada, an assistant teaching professor at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nHowever, in some ways the case in Puerto Rico is unique. Before Hurricane Maria, governors and stakeholders were usually the first ones to raise alarm about the number of deaths — as the mayor of New Orleans did after Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\"This was not the case of Puerto Rico, in Puerto Rico we turned to estimates because both the governor and the president minimized the number,\" Santos-Lozada said.\n\nOrigins of the 3,000 estimate\n\nTrump was referring to an estimate published in late August by George Washington University’s Milken Institute. That estimate was higher than some earlier estimates by academics and the New York Times that were around 1,000, but lower than the 4,645 midpoint of a Harvard study.\n\nGov. Ricardo Rosselló contacted George Washington University in December, which led to commissioning the university to do a study.\n\nThe Milken Institute published the first phase Aug. 28 and found a midpoint of 2,975 excess deaths in the six months following the hurricane.\n\nThat number was 22 percent higher than the number of deaths that would have been expected during that period in a year without the storm. Researchers found that lack of communication and training for doctors about how to certify deaths resulted in an undercount.\n\nTrump misrepresents what the Milken Institute study actually concluded about deaths. The study did not include anyone who died for \"any reason, like old age,\" as he said. If that were the case, the number of deaths would have been much higher. The study found that there were 16,608 total deaths during the six months — and approximately 77 percent were at least 65 years old.\n\nThe study didn’t attribute individual deaths to Maria; it tried to determine a number of \"excess\" deaths. In other words, it tried to find how many deaths would have been expected were it not for the but rather came up with a counterfactual: how many deaths would you expect to see each month if the hurricane hadn’t happened and then subtract the actual number to arrive at an \"excess\" number of deaths.\n\nDr. John \"Jack\" Sandberg, an associate professor in the department of global health, told PolitiFact that the contract stipulated that the study would be done with no government interference by officials in Puerto Rico — and none occurred.\n\n\"I did the number crunching on this, no one ever said boo to me about anything,\" he said. \"We are quite shocked that this is having political repercussions.\"\n\nLynn Goldman, the dean of the Milken Institute, responded to Trump's tweets in a Washington Post op-ed.\n\n\"To set the record straight, our study was carried out with no interference whatsoever from any political party or institution,\" she wrote of the study done in collaboration with scientists at the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Public Health. \"We do not know the exact circumstances around each of the 2,975 excess deaths that occurred. Many factors — disruption in transportation, access to food, water, medications, power and other essentials — may have contributed.\"\n\nThe government in Puerto Rico accepted the Milken institute study and raised Maria's official death toll from 64 to 2,975.\n\nThe study's next phase is expected to more closely examine the identified deaths to look at causes through interviews with family members and medical personnel.\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump tweeted that 3,000 people did not die in two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico and that the death toll estimate was \"done by Democrats.\"\n\nTrump tried to cast doubt on an estimate by George Washington University that includes indirect deaths. Studies by other academics or researchers have also concluded that the number of deaths was above 1,000.\n\nThe death toll provided by the government in Puerto Rico did rise after the storm from 16 to 64 in the months following the storm. The government then hired George Washington University to research an estimate and several months later it produced a report estimate 2,975 deaths. None of that is evidence of an estimate created by a Democratic conspiracy to make Trump look bad.\n\nWe rate this statement False.",

        "text": "Republican Sen. Rick Scott started a spat with Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer over which party is to blame for not approving disaster aid for Puerto Rico.\n\n\"We are so close to getting funding to help FL and PR recover after devastating storms. But the Dems keep holding it up. They need to stop making disaster relief a partisan fight! Let’s get this done NOW!\" Scott tweeted March 25.\n\nWe are so close to getting funding to help FL and PR recover after devastating storms. But the Dems keep holding it up. They need to stop making disaster relief a partisan fight! Let’s get this done NOW! https://t.co/4NTXdkDpMd — Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) March 25, 2019\n\nIn subsequent tweets, Scott repeatedly called out Schumer, saying that the Democrats are delaying funding.\n\nAfter Hurricane Sandy @SenSchumer said “We’ve waited 91 long days. We can’t wait any longer.” Well Floridians have waited for 5 months and the Democrats keep coming up with new ways to delay funding for Florida and Puerto Rico. I won’t accept that; families need this funding now! — Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) March 27, 2019\n\n\"Why are Republicans blocking a simple measure that helps Puerto Rico actually access the recovery aid they need, @SenRickScott? Billions of dollars Congress approved a year ago for disaster recovery remain in the U.S. Treasury—not assisting our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico.\"\n\nWhy are Republicans blocking a simple measure that helps Puerto Rico actually access the recovery aid they need, @SenRickScott?\n\n\n\nBillions of dollars Congress approved a year ago for disaster recovery remain in the U.S. Treasury—not assisting our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico. https://t.co/7KBHnzzBjP — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) March 28, 2019\n\nScott replied: \"When was the last time you were in Puerto Rico, @SenSchumer? (Vacations don’t count). I’ve gone 9 times since Maria and support PR getting the funding they need, including the $600 million in $$ you’re currently blocking. Leaders in PR agree that they need this funding now.\"\n\nWe found that the two parties can’t seem to agree how much aid is necessary or appropriate, and that difference is slowing down the whole process.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nDemocrats in the Senate have been lobbying to pass legislation that helps Puerto Rico, but you wouldn’t get that from Scott’s tweets. The big question: Will the Democrats go along with a GOP measure that has some relief for Puerto Rico, or hold out for more?\n\nWhile Scott has bashed Democrats for not supporting a version of disaster relief legislation that he co-sponsored, that ignores the other disaster relief bills in the House and Senate that have moved forward. (Also when he broadly criticizes the Democrats, he ignores that one of the eight senators joining him on his bill is Democrat Doug Jones of Alabama.)\n\nIronically, in one of Scott’s tweets blaming the Democrats, he linked to an Associated Press article that said Trump’s commitment to help Puerto Rico is in question, while Republicans and Democrats support moving ahead with aid.\n\nSchumer’s counterpunch also requires further explanation: His criticism focuses on Republicans who haven’t shown interest in a recent amendment by a Democrat to beef up aid to Puerto Rico.\n\nHere’s what both sides are doing\n\nHere’s a quick recap of the legislative activity: Over in the House, on Jan. 16, six Republicans joined the Democrats to pass HR 268, which included $12.1 billion for recovery from wildfires, hurricanes, and other recent natural disasters. The legislation included $600 million for Puerto Rico in disaster nutrition assistance.\n\nThat same day, the Trump administration wrote a letter calling $600 million for food funding for Puerto Rico \"excessive and unnecessary.\"\n\nThe Republicans wrote their own version of a bill for $12.7 billion for disaster relief in January, amid the negotiations to end the federal government shutdown, but it didn’t move forward.\n\nUltimately the budget deal Trump signed in February to end the shutdown included no disaster relief.\n\nSen. David Perdue, R-Ga., then wrote a bill cosponsored by Scott that included the $600 million for food for Puerto Rico. This version never got a vote.\n\nBut a similar GOP version does appear to be moving ahead. On March 26, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., introduced a GOP version of the January House bill. He too included the $600 million in food assistance for Puerto Rico, calling it \"a key Democratic priority in the bill.\"\n\nThe GOP version includes relief for the midwest from flooding and tornadoes in 2019 that occurred after the House passed its bill.\n\nReported comments from Trump at a private luncheon with GOP senators added more drama to the funding dilemma. Multiple news reports stated that Trump criticized Puerto Rico’s past use of disaster aid, arguing it had received too much.\n\nThe impasse came to a head later in the day when the Senate voted 90-10 vote to move the House legislation forward, with Scott voting in favor.\n\nOn April 1, the Senate is expected to take up the House Democrats’ version and Shelby’s GOP version. The question now is how much money for Puerto Rico will survive in whatever version the GOP-led Senate passes.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said the Puerto Rico provisions were a \"sticking point\" on the negotiations. He told The Hill that if aid to Puerto Rico is reduced, many Democrats would vote against it. That would put Democrats in the precarious position of voting against disaster aid a year before an election, and it’s unclear how many would take that risk.\n\nNews reports said that Democrats gave Republicans a few options to move forward, including an amendment by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., that included additional money for Puerto Rico including to rebuild damaged water systems and ensure resiliency for future storms.\n\nLeahy’s amendment also calls for forcing the federal government to speed up the process to allocate a separate pot of disaster money, including $8.3 billion for Puerto Rico, that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced in 2018 that it would allocate. The hold up is that the federal government hasn’t finalized the rules related to the funding. (When Schumer said billions approved a year ago remain unspent, this is what he was referring to.)\n\nIt’s not only Senate Democrats who have called out the feds to hurry up to loosen the purse strings.\n\nRepublican senators from Texas, Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, and Gov. Greg Abbott sent a letter to federal officials asking that the government take steps to free up $4.3 billion for flood mitigation earmarked for Texas. (Many Texas representatives including Democrats also signed the letter.)\n\nAlmost one year after HUD allocated that funding, \"Texas cannot begin to utilize this important funding because HUD has not published the rules governing their use in the Federal Register,\" the Republican senators wrote.\n\nBack to the vote upcoming April 1.\n\nIt appears that both parties want to pass disaster aid including for Puerto Rico, but it’s unclear where they will land.\n\nWe sent a summary of our findings to Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan expert on the federal budget. He said there’s plenty of blame to go around:\n\n\"It seems like Senate Democrats are going to defeat the disaster supplemental to gain leverage on the disaster supplemental that will emerge like a Phoenix from the flames of current one. You could say that Democrats are holding it up. You can also say that the Republicans are not being as generous as the Democrats want.\n\n\"But there are also hold-ups with previously appropriated disaster funds because of HUD. It is a mess. I don’t know if the president’s criticism is really holding things up. They seem to be on separate tracks.\"",

        "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump, facing a drastically revised death toll in Puerto Rico a year after dual hurricanes devastated the island, offered a still-rosy outlook of his administration's handling of the disaster on Wednesday.\n\n\"I think we did a fantastic job in Puerto Rico,\" Trump told CNN's Jim Acosta during an exchange with reporters at the White House. \"We're still helping Puerto Rico.\"\n\nIt was an optimistic accounting of his administration's handling of the natural disaster, which left much of the US territory without power for weeks and resulted in thousands of deaths.\n\nThe island's governor formally raised the death toll from 64 to 2,975 on Tuesday following a study conducted by researchers at George Washington University\n\nThe study accounted for Puerto Ricans who succumbed to the stifling heat and other after-effects of the storm and were not previously counted in official figures.\n\nTrump has trumpeted his handling of the storm's aftermath, including saying in the days afterward the storm had resulted in a relatively small number of deaths compared to a \"real catastrophe like Katrina.\" Hurricane Katrina, which devastated parts of Louisiana in 2005, killed roughly 1,200.\n\nHe also awarded himself a \"10 out of 10\" on disaster recovery efforts during an Oval Office meeting last year with Puerto Rico's governor.\n\n\"Did we do a great job?\" he asked his guest.\n\nThrough it all, Trump has maintained that Puerto Rico's languishing infrastructure and geography hampered efforts. He said on Wednesday an outdated electric grid and the territory's status as an island continued to the difficulty.\n\n\"Puerto Rico was actually more difficult because of the fact it was an island,\" he said. \"It's much harder to get things on the island.\"\n\n\"The administration killed the Puerto Ricans with neglect. The Trump administration led us to believe they were helping when they weren't up to par, and they didn't allow other countries to help us,\" Yulín Cruz said on CNN Wednesday, later adding, \"Shame on President Trump. Shame on President Trump for not even once, not even yesterday, just saying, 'Look, I grieve with the people of Puerto Rico.'\"\n\nTrump did not respond directly to his critics Wednesday, instead saying he hoped the island doesn't suffer a similar fate this year.\n\n\"I only hope they don't get hit again because they were hit by two in a row,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's comments were reminiscent of former President George W. Bush's comments days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana, when Bush praised his FEMA director Michael Brown during his first visit to the region affected by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\n\"Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job,\" Bush said then.\n\nTrump's comments on Wednesday were not the first time he has praised the federal response in Puerto Rico. And while the death toll was not known when he voiced some of his earlier praise, they did come as disaster relief experts and local officials sounded the alarm about the slow pace of the federal response.\n\n\"Every death is a horror -- but if you look at a real catastrophe, like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering -- nobody has ever seen anything like this,\" Trump said in Puerto Rico less than two weeks after Maria struck. \"Everybody around this table and everybody watching can really be very proud of what's taken place in Puerto Rico.\"\n\nTrump not only repeatedly praised the federal response, but he also struck out at the news media and critics who highlighted the slow pace of some of the recovery efforts and the dire conditions that much of the island continued to face for weeks and months after the hurricane made landfall.\n\nTen days after the hurricane made landfall, Trump lambasted news reports about the troubled situation in Puerto Rico in a series of tweets.\n\n\"Despite the Fake News Media in conjunction with the Dems, an amazing job is being done in Puerto Rico,\" Trump tweeted. \"The Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first R's. Shame!\"\n\nIn another tweet, he lashed out at San Juan's mayor, who had taken to the airwaves to raise alarm about the slow pace of recovery efforts.\n\n\"Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help,\" he tweeted.",

        "text": "(CNN) Though hurricane season runs from June through November, it is during the \"off-season\" when forecasters and researchers refine and improve their forecasting models, methods and techniques, allowing forecasters to enhance the accuracy of storm predictions.\n\nWith the partial government shutdown in its third week , and no end in sight, much of the research and development the National Hurricane Center relies on to improve hurricane forecasts is in jeopardy, along with badly needed upgrades to the main American weather model.\n\n\"It's a tight schedule,\" Eric Blake, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center (NHC) told CNN, \"we try to fit in as many improvements as possible before the next hurricane season.\"\n\nWhile there is no good time for a government shutdown to bring the work of so many federal workers to a halt, according to Blake, \"it is much worse for this to happen during the off-season.\" Blake is the NHC's Union Steward to the National Weather Service's Employee Organization and spoke to CNN on its behalf.\n\nDuring the hurricane season, the forecasters, which are working during the shutdown, would be doing their mission-critical work forecasting active storms in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Oceans. Because of this, research and development is frozen during the hurricane season.\n\nFrom December through early May, however, the center's forecasters work with researchers and scientists at other governmental agencies to tweak and upgrade the models that are used to project the storms -- and many of these workers are currently furloughed.\n\nOne of these agencies is the Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), which, like the NHC, is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).\n\nThe EMC develops and improves weather and climate predictions through numerical models, and right now should be working with Blake and other hurricane forecasters to make adjustments to the models based upon new research and lessons learned from the previous hurricane season.\n\nAnd considering the forecast challenges presented by Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Michael last year, these months are critical to improving the forecast models and implementing new research and techniques.\n\nBut of the 200 people that work on these and other NOAA forecast models at the EMC, and their various government contractors, only one of them is currently working through the shutdown. The other 199 are deemed \"non-critical\" and are furloughed, unable to access their computers to even check on the progress of their models until the government shutdown ends.\n\nAccording to Suru Saha, one of the furloughed computer modelers at the EMC, the longer the shutdown goes on, the less prepared we will be when the next hurricane season begins.\n\n\"This is lost time that cannot be made up,\" Saha told CNN. Saha also serves as the center's union steward to the NWS Employee Organization. \"It's gone and it will effect future operations.\"\n\nBut it isn't just hurricane model upgrades that are being neglected during the partial government shutdown.\n\nThe EMC oversees NCEP's entire suite of global forecast models , including the Global Forecast System model, or GFS model, which is often referred to as the \"American model,\" and is used to forecast everything from nor'easters to tornado outbreaks.\n\nThe American model has come under fire in recent years after falling notably behind the European's model, the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model, in high profile events such as Hurricane Sandy.\n\nThis is a verification report -- basically the report card for models. It shows how each of the models verified over the course of a 31 day period. The European model -- the red dash line with triangles -- has performed the best through the period. The American model -- the black line -- was doing fine and then has become slightly more inaccurate since the 26th of December.\n\nBut the GFS was due to get a significant makeover over the next month, known as the FV3 upgrade\n\nThe update promises to better utilize advances in computing technology and data processing to \"deliver better, more timely forecasts to serve the growing needs of our forecasters and the weather enterprise,\" according to NOAA's website.\n\n\"We're banking on it to do great things,\" Saha told CNN of the upgraded GFS-FV3, \"every system we have have is dependent on the quality of the GFS forecast.\"\n\n\"But all of that is on hold,\" she said. \"I don't see that happening in February.\" NOAA confirmed to CNN that these upgrades are likely to be delayed due to the shutdown.\n\n\"There are improvements scheduled in the next upgrade window that may be delayed due to the shutdown,\" a NOAA spokesperson said, though no time table was given as to how long that delay might be once the shutdown has ended.\n\nIn addition to delays in upgrades, there have been concerns that the shutdown could be resulting in a degradation of the current American GFS model , and thus the forecasts millions of people receive through apps and other forecast systems that rely upon the model's data.\n\nBut the NOAA spokesperson pushed back on these reports, claiming that \"the accuracy of the nation's forecast model is maintained to the same standards as normal ... and the resources [the forecasters] need to perform essential operations are being provided.\"\n\nAs forecast modeling has improved, the accuracy of forecasting where a hurricane will make landfall has improved.\n\nBut even if the forecast models are maintained during the shutdown, it is clear they are not getting better. And that could mean the forecast for a major hurricane in September or October of this year isn't as good as it could be.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has reduced their average forecast track error for tropical systems in the Atlantic from 220 miles to 70 miles since the year 2000, with almost steady improvement year over year. But Blake is afraid that same improvement won't be possible this year.\n\n\"It's going to be more status quo next year,\" Blake said, referring to the lack of research and development and new initiatives that the shutdown is causing.\n\nAnd the shutdown threatens to reduce our country's preparedness for hurricanes in other ways beyond just the forecast.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is set to host a series of meetings over the next several weeks with FEMA for emergency managers and key decision makers along the Gulf Coast and East Coast, that Blake said are designed to familiarize them with important products and services so they can make the best informed decision for their regions.\n\n\"If the shutdown continues and we have to cancel the meetings with FEMA, then that will hurt America's hurricane readiness,\" Blake said, which could potentially place American lives and property at risk.",

Agencies have been strained, in part, by the shift in demographics -- from single adult males to families and children from Central America seeking asylum.\n\n\"Agencies are literally running out of funds,\" the official said.\n\nFacing resistance from Democrats over the billions he requested for the wall, Trump declared a national emergency earlier this year in a bid to secure the funds without lawmakers' approval.\n\nThe budget proposal he unveiled this year also allocated billions for border security.\n\nOn Tuesday, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said a supplemental request was coming that would seek funding for temporary and semi-permanent migrant processing facilities, additional personnel along the border, increased detention capacity and upgrades to \"overtaxed\" information technology systems.\n\n\"Given the scale of what we are facing, we will exhaust our resources before the end of this fiscal year,\" he told a House appropriations subcommittee.\n\nThe request isn't intended to create \"policies to be aggressive on immigration,\" but rather to address the increased flows of migrants, according to a Department of Homeland Security official.\n\nIt also includes a request for additional bed space and transportation funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE is currently averaging around 50,000 people in custody, which is above the current detention funding levels. A DHS official acknowledged that the request for additional beds is likely to get pushback from lawmakers.\n\nThe request is expected to run into problems on Capitol Hill because of serious Democratic concerns over intent on immigration broadly, as well as the still-languishing disaster relief supplemental, which has imploded the last few weeks.",

        "text": "NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Credit rating agency Standard & Poor's on Friday downgraded the credit rating of the United States, stripping the world's largest economy of its prized AAA status.\n\nIn July, S&P placed the United States' rating on \"CreditWatch with negative implications\" as the debt ceiling debate devolved into partisan bickering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid a downgrade, S&P said the United States needed to not only raise the debt ceiling, but also develop a \"credible\" plan to tackle the nation's long-term debt.\n\nIn its report Friday, S&P ruled that the U.S. fell short: \"The downgrade reflects our opinion that the ... plan that Congress and the Administration recently agreed to falls short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilize the government's medium-term debt dynamics.\"\n\nS&P also cited dysfunctional policymaking in Washington as a factor in the downgrade. \"The political brinksmanship of recent months highlights what we see as America's governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less effective, and less predictable than what we previously believed.\" (FAQ: Behind the downgrade)\n\nA Treasury Department spokesman pushed back on the rating change, saying that S&P's analysis was flawed.\n\nA source familiar with the matter said S&P initially miscalculated the growth trajectory of the nation's debt, and then went ahead with its downgrade anyway.\n\nThe source also said S&P didn't give enough credit for the debt-ceiling compromise, which paved the way for more than $2 trillion in spending cuts over the next 10 years.\n\nHowever, one of S&P's explicit criticisms of the compromise was that it didn't address the biggest drivers of the nation's debt -- Social Security and Medicare -- and didn't allow for additional tax revenue. (\"What's wrong with the debt ceiling deal?\")\n\nJohn Chambers, Head of Sovereign Ratings for S&P, told CNN that though S&P didn't have a specific target in mind, the total debt reduction package was not sufficient. Chambers also noted that the plan did not take steps in the near term to boost economic growth.\n\nRating agencies -- S&P, Moody's and Fitch -- analyze risk and give debt a \"grade\" that reflects the borrower's ability to pay the underlying loans.\n\nThe safest bets are stamped AAA. That's where U.S. debt has stood for years. Moody's first assigned the United States a AAA rating in 1917. The country's new S&P rating is AA+ -- still strong, but not the highest.\n\nThe downgrade puts the U.S. debt rating on par with that of Belgium, but below countries like the United Kingdom and Australia. (See who's in the Triple-A Club.)\n\nIn the days after lawmakers managed to strike a debt-ceiling deal, the two other major rating agencies have both said the deficit reduction actions taken by Congress were a step in the right direction.\n\nOn Tuesday, Moody's said the United States will keep its sterling AAA credit rating, but lowered its outlook on U.S. debt to \"negative.\"\n\nEven after a downgrade, the United States will likely still be able to pay its bills for years to come and remains a good credit risk.\n\nA downgrade really just amounts to one agency's opinion. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke articulated that view in April when S&P placed the United States on credit watch. \"S&P's action didn't really tell us anything,\" Bernanke said. \"Everybody who reads the newspaper knows that the United States has a very serious long-term fiscal problem.\"\n\nInvestors have limited options for making safe investments, and Treasuries are effectively as liquid as cash. And other big countries have been downgraded and were still able to borrow at low rates.\n\nAt the same time, some experts warn that a downgrade could gum up the banking system and ripple out onto Main Street. Treasuries are used as collateral in many transactions between financial institutions and grease the skids of lending.\n\nShortly after the downgrade, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and other bank regulators moved to blunt the affect of the action on the banking system. In a joint release, the agencies said they would continue to treat Treasuries and other securities issued by government-sponsored entities (such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) the same as before they were downgraded. Treasuries are often used as collateral for short-term lending among banks and other financial institutions.\n\nConsumers and investors could feel the impact of a downgrade. Interest rates on bonds could rise, and rates on mortgages and other types of loans along with them. (Your stocks, your cash: Will you feel the downgrade?)\n\nGovernment-backed agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may also be downgraded. It's also possible that some state and local governments could also face a downgrade.\n\nAnd investment decisions would become complicated for large institutional investors that are required to hold highly-rated securities.",

        "text": "All the aides who defied Trump have long since departed. Gone, too, are some of the guardrails they erected to keep Trump out of trouble. In their absence, Trump has installed more pliant senior advisers, meaning the nation could see more of the ill-considered and ultimately self-sabotaging behavior that Mueller chronicled in his nearly two-year investigation.\n\nYoni Appelbaum: The Mueller report is an impeachment referral\n\nMueller wasn’t about to charge Trump with a crime, it turns out. But what’s clear from the report is that had White House aides not thwarted Trump, the picture would look worse, and impeachment might seem a more viable path.\n\nIt’s doubtful he sees it that way. Not one for introspection, Trump values loyalty and appreciates flattery. Unwelcome truths are harder for him to absorb.\n\nOne of the odder stories of Trump’s presidency is how his impression of Jeff Sessions darkened. Sessions was the first senator to endorse Trump in the 2016 campaign, and supplied some of the aides who gave heft to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Trump rewarded Sessions by naming him attorney general. But he turned on Sessions—humiliating him with a string of Twitter posts—once the attorney general relinquished command of the Russia investigation and delegated the role to Rosenstein.\n\nTrump was furious about the appointment of a special counsel in May 2017. Told about it by Sessions, Trump said, “This is the end of my Presidency. I’m fucked,” the report shows.\n\nRead: The Democrats’ plan to summon Robert Mueller\n\nTrump blamed Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation because of a conflict of interest arising from his work on Trump’s campaign.\n\nTrump later called Sessions at home and asked him to “unrecuse” himself. He wanted Sessions back in charge so that he could investigate the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, and also resume control of the Russia investigation.\n\nSessions did not respond, the report shows, but neither did he comply and reverse his recusal.\n\nIn an Oval Office meeting in December 2017, Trump again pressed Sessions to reverse himself. “You’d be a hero,” Trump said.\n\nSessions never relented; he stayed out of the Russia probe to the end. Evaluating Trump’s actions, Mueller wrote in the report that “a reasonable inference … is that the President believed that an unrecused Attorney General would play a protective role and could shield the President from the ongoing Russia investigation.”\n\nUnhappy about Sessions, Trump at one point asked a top aide, Robert Porter, to approach Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand and ask her whether she might take over the Justice Department and head the Russia investigation. Porter didn’t go along; he said he was “uncomfortable with the task,” the report shows. Porter believed Trump was looking to install someone at the department who would fire Mueller or end the Russia probe—the same actions Sessions wouldn’t take. Not wanting to be part of such a “chain of events,” Porter never spoke to Brand. And so whatever Trump had in mind for her never came to pass.",

        "text": "Budget Director Mick Mulvaney has said that he is interested in succeeding Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo White House Wilbur Ross leaving? Mulvaney is waiting. Amid the drama around higher-profile Trump officials, the president's 80-year-old Commerce chief may be on the way out.\n\nTo hear Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and his allies tell it, rumors of his demise have been greatly exaggerated.\n\nAdministration officials and close White House advisers say the 80-year-old Ross could be out of a job in a broader Cabinet shake-up as soon as January or as late as mid-2019. Ross, long said to be on thin ice with President Donald Trump, denies either scenario. \"I'll serve as long as the president wants and I have no indication to the contrary,” he told an audience at a Yahoo Finance event on Nov. 13.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut in a sign of Ross’ perceived weakness, at least one influential Trump ally has begun speaking openly about his desire for the Commerce job if and when it becomes vacant: Office of Management and Budget chief Mick Mulvaney.\n\nOver the summer, Trump considered a willing Mulvaney as a potential replacement for his chief of staff, John Kelly. However, in recent days, Mulvaney has abandoned that ambition and told allies and other officials that he is now interested in succeeding Ross, according to several people familiar with the conversations. Trump and Mulvaney have not spoken specifically about the Commerce slot, a Mulvaney ally said.\n\nOther names circulating for the top Commerce slot include Small Business Administration Administrator Linda McMahon; Ray Washburne, a major Republican donor and the president and CEO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation; and Karen Dunn Kelly, undersecretary for economic affairs at Commerce, who is jockeying for the job internally at the department. A Commerce spokesperson strongly denied the notion that Kelly, the Commerce undersecretary, is jockeying for the position.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nAlthough Commerce lacks the high profile of some other departments whose leadership is currently in question — including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense — Ross and his aides have played a critical role in Trump’s high-stakes trade negotiations with China, as well as trade and tariffs involving Canada, Mexico and other nations. His successor would also oversee the crucial 2020 census, which will help determine the future apportionment of seats in Congress.\n\nThe deliberations and back-channel conversations about Ross’ job show the extent to which the White House is currently consumed by personnel machinations as it braces for the onslaught of a Democratic House in January and possible new indictments of Trump associates by special counsel Robert Mueller. Top aides and Republicans close to the White House describe an atmosphere of tension and uncertainty as they monitor the president’s mood and study his Twitter feed for clues about the fates of beleaguered Cabinet officials — including that of Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen, whose long-rumored firing is believed to be imminent.\n\nThe White House’s mood, and its latest internal thinking about personnel changes, were described to POLITICO by eight current and former administration officials and close White House advisers.\n\nThis week has already seen the dramatic ouster of national security adviser John Bolton’s deputy, Mira Ricardel, whose clashes with the office of first lady Melania Trump led the president’s wife to issue a highly unusual public statement calling for her removal.\n\nSeveral top Trump aides are weighing their own fates by looking for other work. Some hope to find refuge in Trump’s 2020 campaign, which will be staffing up in the coming months.\n\nTrump himself has snapped at a handful of top aides and outside lawyers in the past several days. He is unsettled over a flood of bad news — from poor reviews of his weekend trip to Paris to the slow trickle of bad news for Republicans about outstanding midterm races to mounting worry that Mueller may soon drop more bombshell indictments.\n\nEven in an ever-roiling White House that has always tested its staff, the current moment looks particularly dark.\n\n“Morale is [at] a low point,” said one former administration official. “There is all of this uncertainty about who will still be in the White House in a few months and anxiety about what anyone has to look forward to — just the Democratic Congress making everyone’s lives miserable.”\n\nA major wild card now is how and when Kelly decides to leave the administration. He and Nielsen — who served as his top aide when he ran DHS and followed him to the White House — remain close, and he recently berated a senior colleague who questioned her abilities. Several Republicans believe Kelly will exit the administration shortly after she does, meaning that a Trump tweet announcing her exit could also amount to word that the White House’s top staff job will imminently open up.\n\nVice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, Nick Ayers, is seen as a leading contender to replace Kelly. While the 36-year-old Ayers enjoys the support of Trump’s family, including daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, he also has powerful internal detractors who could block his ascent.\n\nMeanwhile, some White House officials say that Mulvaney’s interest in a Cabinet position — following summer talk that he might succeed Kelly — may reflect a belief that the former politician was unlikely to get that job in the first place. The 51-year-old Mulvaney, an ideological economic conservative, served as a South Carolina state legislator and congressman before taking over Trump's budget office in February 2017.\n\nOther Cabinet officials remain under the close watch of the White House, including Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, whose current plight reminds administration sources of former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s before his firing. Trump openly admires Zinke and White House aides do not expect the president to oust him anytime soon. But several aides said they feel exasperated by the half-dozen ethics-related investigations into Zinke’s conduct and worry those investigations could be a drag as Trump revs up his 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nOne White House official said Zinke’s troubles are worse than Pruitt’s ever were because they now include a referral to the Justice Department, which is weighing whether a criminal investigation is necessary.\n\nOn Nielsen, White House aides are so confident Trump will fire her that some have already started to coalesce around her potential replacement: Thomas Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nTrump also needs to tap a new attorney general to replace the fired Jeff Sessions. The job is now held by Sessions’ former chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, a controversial Trump loyalist considered unlikely to win Senate confirmation. In an interview with the conservative Daily Caller published Thursday, Trump said he is “looking at a lot of people” for the post, adding: “I have been called by so many people wanting that job.”\n\nAll these subplots have recently overshadowed the fate of Ross, whom Trump has called “past his prime” and whose influence with Trump over China policy has markedly diminished since the start of Trump’s presidency. That has helped Ross to lay low as his allies and a handful of White House aides seek to cast any near-term Ross departure as voluntary, easing him into retirement.\n\n“Ross has not done anything terribly wrong that caused distrust with the president. The president might not be happy with everyone all of the time, but what happens this week is often forgotten with no grudges held,” said one former senior administration official. “Loyalty in this business is all you got, and Secretary Ross is loyal to the president. That is the difference between him and some of the other Cabinet members.\n\nWhile Trump likes Ross personally — the wealthy Commerce chief was among a select group who joined the president in the White House on election night, for example — he has increasingly relied more heavily on other senior administration officials, like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and National Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow to take the lead on sensitive negotiations\n\nBut another former senior administration official noted that Ross is deeply involved in at least one policy issue that Trump obsesses over: a crucial ongoing report outlining the effects of potential tariffs on imported foreign cars. Trump, against the advice of most in his administration, has repeatedly threatened to slap tariffs of as much as 25 percent on auto imports.\n\n“Wilbur has had ups and downs in his relationship with the president throughout the past two years. At various points he’s been sidelined on trade and other policy processes,” the former official said. “But it’s Wilbur who’s in charge of the report on potential auto tariffs, so it’s unlikely he’s fired if the president is serious about pursuing that path.”\n\nAlthough he is the oldest of Trump’s Cabinet officials, a source close to Ross says the Commerce secretary shows no sign of slowing down and continues to attend the weekly trade meeting in the Oval Office, in addition to taking on a key role with the White House’s workforce initiative.\n\nUndermining that portrait, however, are embarrassing reports that he falls asleep in official meetings.\n\nRoss and his wife, Hilary, are also among the few top Trump officials to really settle into Washington. Unlike Gary Cohn, Trump’s former top economic official — who stayed at the Four Seasons hotel on weeknights and returned to New York for weekends — Ross bought a $12 million house in the tony neighborhood of Massachusetts Avenue Heights, where his wife is known for throwing elaborate dinners and parties.\n\nThe couple are also members of Trump's private Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida and have deep ties in the surrounding Palm Beach community where Trump has wintered for decades — social ties which other Trump officials currently on the hot seat lack, and which make the potential departure awkward for a president who dislikes confrontation.\n\nAs for Mulvaney, a White House official said Trump likes his budget chief and would consider him for another Cabinet role when one opens up.\n\nThe official added that Trump has no immediate plans to remove Ross from the Commerce Department, but acknowledged that Ross, who is turning 81 later this month, is not expected to remain in his post for long.\n\nGabby Orr and Eliana Johnson contributed to this report.",

In fact, January saw a 10-percentage-point increase from December in views of government as the most important problem. The second-most-frequently mentioned problem is immigration -- at 21%, a rate notably higher than December's 16%, and coinciding with the controversy over plans to extend the physical barrier on the nation's Southern border.\n\nGovernment, Immigration Up as U.S. Most Important Problem in January What do you think is the most important problem facing this country today? [OPEN-ENDED] Sep 4-12 , 2018 Oct 1-10 , 2018 Nov 1-11 , 2018 Dec 3-12 , 2018 Jan 2-10 , 2019 % % % % % The government/Poor leadership 29 27 18 19 29 Immigration 12 13 21 16 21 Race relations/Racism 9 6 9 7 8 Healthcare 5 6 11 5 7 Unifying the country 7 6 9 8 5 Economy in general 3 3 4 3 3 Lack of respect for each other 4 5 6 5 3 Poverty/Hunger/Homelessness 4 2 2 6 3 Environment/Pollution 1 3 2 5 3 Gallup\n\nDespite a volatile stock market in past weeks, economic issues received less concern from Americans as the most important problem. While 3% mention the economy by name, a total of 14% of Americans overall cite economic problems. January mentions of economic problems are among the lowest Gallup has ever measured, dating back to 1939. The last time 50% of Americans cited economy-related issues as the most important problem was May 2014.\n\nCan't Get No … Satisfaction\n\nMost Americans remain unsatisfied with the way things are going in the United States. About one in four (26%) say they are satisfied, down from 31% in December and 35% in November.\n\nThis month saw a six-point increase in the percentage of those saying they are dissatisfied, bringing the total to 72%, the highest since November 2017.\n\nHighly educated respondents express lower degrees of satisfaction. For example, 19% of those with postgraduate education and 21% of those with a college education express satisfaction. Meanwhile, 30% of those with a high school education or less are satisfied.\n\nHowever, the starkest differences in levels of satisfaction among Americans are across partisan lines, with Republicans (54%) far more likely than independents (24%) or Democrats (8%) to be satisfied with how things are going in the country.\n\nSatisfaction With U.S., by Party ID In general, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in the United States at this time? Satisfied Dissatisfied % % Republican 54 45 Independent 24 73 Democrat 8 91 Gallup, Jan 2-10, 2019\n\nDisparity in Percentage Very Dissatisfied by Gender\n\nMeasuring the level of dissatisfaction about the way things are going in the U.S. at a more granular level, Gallup asked respondents the degree to which they are either satisfied or dissatisfied. Overall, 7% of Americans are very satisfied, 19% somewhat satisfied, 26% somewhat dissatisfied and 46% very dissatisfied. The percentage very dissatisfied is on the higher end of what Gallup has measured over the past 25 years, but it has been as high as 57%, in October 2011.\n\nThere is an important disparity in satisfaction levels by gender. A slim majority of women express that they are very dissatisfied with how things are going in the United States, while fewer than four in 10 men are very dissatisfied.\n\nHigh Dissatisfaction With the U.S., by Gender Are you very [satisfied/dissatisfied], or just somewhat [satisfied/dissatisfied]? Very dissatisfied % Male 39 Female 52 Gallup, Jan. 2-10, 2019\n\nBottom Line\n\nWith the current government shutdown reaching a record length, half of Americans see either the government or immigration policy -- the issue at the root of the shutdown -- as the nation's top problem. Thus, whether Americans side with the Democrats or Republicans on the political showdown, a large segment of the country considers the issues at stake to be momentous.\n\nMost Americans continue to express dissatisfaction with the way things are going in the country. The last time a majority of Americans were satisfied was in 2004. While most Republicans remain satisfied, independents and Democrats are far less likely to be. Finally, most women say they are very dissatisfied with how things are going in the country.\n\nView complete question responses and trends.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.",

        "text": "Most Border Wall Opponents, Supporters Say Shutdown Concessions Are Unacceptable\n\nPartisan divide on whether shutdown is ‘very serious’ problem\n\nWith the partial shutdown of the federal government in its third week, both opponents and supporters of expanding the U.S.-Mexico border wall overwhelmingly oppose making concessions to end the stalemate.\n\nA new Pew Research Center survey finds that majority of Americans (58%) continue to oppose substantially expanding the border wall, while 40% favor the proposal. Overall opinion on the wall is little changed from last year, but these views have never been more sharply divided along partisan lines: Republican support for the wall is at record high, while Democratic support has reached a new low.\n\nAnd both sides appear to be dug in: Nearly nine-in-ten (88%) opponents of expanding the border wall say it would not be acceptable to pass a bill that includes President Donald Trump’s request for wall funding, if that is the only way to end the shutdown. Among the smaller group of wall supporters, 72% say a bill to end the shutdown would be unacceptable if it does not include Trump’s funding request.\n\nAt a time when there are wide partisan differences on most political issues, the divisions over the shutdown and border wall are especially striking. Democrats and Republicans disagree on whether the border wall would reduce illegal immigration into the U.S. and on the impact of the shutdown on the country.\n\nNearly eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (79%) say the shutdown is a “very serious problem”; fewer than half as many Republicans and Republican leaners (35%) say the same.\n\nThe new survey, conducted Jan. 9-14 among 1,505 adults, finds that none of Washington’s political leaders receives positive approval ratings for their handling of the government shutdown. Just 43% approve of the way Democratic congressional leaders are handling the government shutdown, while smaller shares approve of how Donald Trump (36%) and GOP congressional leaders (also 36%) are handling the shutdown.\n\nTrump’s overall job approval stands at 37%, which is little changed from measures over the past year. Trump’s support among Republicans and Republican leaners remains high (80% approve), while nearly all Democrats and Democratic leaners (96%) disapprove of his job performance. The partisan gap in Trump’s job approval is wider than for any president in more than six decades.\n\nWidening party divide over expanding the border wall\n\nPublic views of a U.S.-Mexico border wall have changed little over the past three years. But the partisan gap has widened, as Republicans have become more supportive of a border wall, while Democratic support has declined.\n\nCurrently, 58% of Americans oppose substantially expanding the wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, while 40% favor the proposal.\n\nSince early 2016, roughly six-in-ten Americans have opposed building or expanding the border wall (in 2016-2017 the question asked about “building a wall along the entire border with Mexico”).\n\nYet partisan differences are now wider than they have ever been. Today, 82% of Republicans and Republican leaners favor substantially expanding the wall along the U.S-Mexico border. Over the past year alone, Republican support for expanding the border wall has increased 10 percentage points (from 72% to 82%). Over the same period, the share of Democrats who favor expanding the U.S.-Mexico border wall has declined from 13% to 6%.\n\nConservative Republicans and Republican leaners (who make up about two-thirds of all Republicans and GOP leaners) overwhelmingly favor expanding the U.S.-Mexico border wall (91% favor). Moderate and liberal Republicans are somewhat less supportive (69% favor).\n\nOverwhelming shares of both liberal Democrats (97%) and conservative and moderate Democrats (89%) oppose expanding the border wall.\n\nAs in the past, opinions about expanding the U.S.-Mexico border wall are divided by race, education and age. Whites (46% favor) are more than twice as likely as blacks (20%) or Hispanics (23%) to favor expanding the border wall.\n\nAnd support for expanding the wall is much greater among older adults. About half of those ages 50 and older (48%) favor substantially expanding the border wall; just 25% of those ages 18 to 29 and 36% of those 30 to 49 say the same.\n\nRoughly a third of Americans (34%) now say substantially expanding the U.S.-Mexico border wall would result in a major reduction in illegal immigration into the U.S., up from 29% two years ago. Two-in-ten say expansion would lead to a minor reduction in illegal immigration, while a plurality (44%) continues to say expanding the wall would have little impact.\n\nNearly seven-in-ten Republicans (69%) now say expanding the wall would lead to a major reduction in illegal immigration into the U.S. – up from 58% who said the same in 2017. Conservative Republicans (79%) continue to be far more likely than moderates and liberals in the GOP to say expanding the wall would lead to a major decrease in illegal immigration.\n\nAmong Democrats, 70% say expanding the border wall would not have much of an impact on illegal immigration into the U.S., which is changed only slightly from two years ago (65%).\n\nAs in the previous survey, whites (39%) are more likely than blacks and Hispanics (22% each) to say the expansion of the wall would lead to a major reduction in illegal immigration into the U.S. By contrast, blacks (64%) and Hispanics (54%) are more likely to say the wall would have no impact.\n\nPartisans dig in on border wall, government shutdown\n\nAmong the public overall, 29% both favor substantially expanding the border wall and say passing a bill that does not include the president’s requested funding would be unacceptable even if it is the only way to end the government shutdown. But a far larger share of the public – about half (51%) – takes the starkly opposite view, expressing both opposition to the wall and saying that a bill that includes funding for wall expansion would be unacceptable, even if it’s the only way to end the shutdown.\n\nThese views largely break along partisan lines: 84% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents both oppose the wall and say funding for it would be unacceptable. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, a smaller majority (63%) both favor the wall expansion and say not funding it would be an unacceptable way to resolve the shutdown.\n\nWithin the Democratic coalition, there is no difference on these views between those who identify as Democrats and independents who “lean” to the party. By contrast, those who identify as Republicans are more likely to favor expanding the wall than those who lean to the GOP (87% vs. 74%). And while 69% of those who affiliate with the Republican Party say a deal to end the government shutdown that does not include Trump’s funding request would be unacceptable, only about half of Republican leaners (53%) say the same.\n\nPublic disapproves of how shutdown negotiations are being handled\n\nMost Americans offer negative evaluations of the way that the nation’s political leaders in both parties – Donald Trump, Democratic congressional leaders and Republican congressional leaders – are handling negotiations over the shutdown.\n\nOverall, just 36% of the public approves of how Trump is handling negotiations over the government shutdown, including 23% who say they strongly approve. About six-in-ten (61%) disapprove of Trump’s approach to the negotiations, including 53% who say they strongly disapprove.\n\nViews of how Republican leaders in Congress are handling shutdown negotiations generally parallel evaluations of Trump. Six-in-ten Americans say they disapprove of the way Republican congressional leaders are handling negotiations, while just 36% say they approve. However, fewer Americans characterize their views of GOP leaders’ handling of negotiations as “strong” approval or disapproval than say this about the president.\n\nPublic views of Democratic leaders’ handling of the shutdown talks are somewhat more positive than views of Trump or GOP leaders. Still, more disapprove (53%) than approve (43%).\n\nIn evaluations of how each is handling shutdown talks, Trump elicits stronger opinions than Democratic and Republican congressional leaders. Overall, 75% of adults characterize their opinion of Trump’s handling of the shutdown negotiations as either strongly disapproving (53%) or strongly approving (23%). By comparison, only about half of Americans offer strong evaluations of how congressional leadership in both parties are handling the negotiations.\n\nPartisans approve their party’s approach to shutdown negotiations, disapprove of other party’s\n\nAmong Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 76% approve of how Trump is handling shutdown talks, including 50% who say they strongly approve of Trump’s approach. In contrast, just 4% of Democrats approve of Trump’s handling of the negotiations, while 93% disapprove (including 87% who say they strongly disapprove).\n\nThe overall pattern is similar in views of Republican leaders in Congress: 69% of Republicans approve of their party’s leaders’ handling of negotiations, while just 10% of Democrats approve.\n\nAnd while about seven-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners (71%) approve of the way Democratic leaders in Congress are handling the shutdown negotiations, just 11% of Republicans say the same.\n\nPartisans differ over whether shutdown is a ‘very serious problem’\n\nAbout six-in-ten adults (58%) say the government shutdown is a “very serious problem” for the country today, while 22% view it as a somewhat serious problem; just two-in-ten say that it is not too (13%) or not at all (7%) serious a problem for the country.\n\nDemocrats are far more likely than Republicans to view the shutdown as a very serious problem for the nation: Nearly eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners (79%) say this, compared with just 35% of Republicans and Republican leaners.\n\nOnly about a quarter of conservative Republicans and GOP-leaning independents (27%) see the shutdown as a very serious problem facing the country, compared with 47% of moderate and liberal Republicans. Ideological differences among Democrats are more modest: 85% of liberal Democrats consider the shutdown a very serious problem, while 73% of conservative and moderate Democrats say the same.",

That deal included a 10-14 year path to citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers, as well as permanent status and full protections afforded to all US citizens.\n\nThat deal could have included a wall, and Sen. Chuck Schumer privately promised as much as $20 billion to Trump in exchange for a path to citizenship for eligible immigrants.\n\nThe proposal had 54 votes in the Senate at the time, but Trump rejected that bipartisan proposal and threatened a veto.\n\nNow, the White House is offering the BRIDGE Act. When it was originally proposed, the bill offered temporary protections while a long term sustainable deal was hatched. Democrats were much more open to a deal back then because they didn't have a majority in the House.\n\nThe bottom line: Trump's latest proposal isn't nearly as good of a deal for either side. For Democrats, it's a temporary solution for DACA and TPS recipients. For the President, it's far less funding for the wall than what he turned down ($5.7 billion vs. $25 billion).",

        "text": "By a wide margin, more Americans blame President Trump and Republicans in Congress than congressional Democrats for the now record-breaking government shutdown, and most reject the president’s assertion that there is an illegal-immigration crisis on the southern border, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.\n\nSupport for building a wall on the border, which is the principal sticking point in the stalemate between the president and Democrats, has increased over the past year. Today, 42 percent say they support a wall, up from 34 percent last January. A slight majority of Americans (54 percent) oppose the idea, down from 63 percent a year ago.\n\nThe increase in support is sharpest among Republicans, whose backing for Trump’s long-standing campaign promise jumped 16 points in the past year, from 71 percent to 87 percent. Not only has GOP support increased, it has also hardened. Today, 70 percent of Republicans say they strongly support the wall, an increase of 12 points since January 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n[ Read full poll results | How the poll was conducted ]\n\nConcerning the allocation of blame, 53 percent say Trump and the Republicans are mainly at fault, and 29 percent blame the Democrats in Congress. Thirteen percent say both sides bear equal responsibility for the shutdown. That is identical to the end of the 16-day shutdown in 2013, when 29 percent blamed then-President Barack Obama and 53 percent put the responsibility on congressional Republicans.\n\nA predictable partisan divide shapes the blame game, with 85 percent of Democrats citing Trump and Republicans as the cause and 68 percent of Republicans pointing the finger at congressional Democrats. Independents fix the blame squarely on the president and his party rather than on the Democrats, by 53 percent to 23 percent. Women blame Trump and Republicans by a margin of 35 points, and men blame the president and the GOP by 13 points.\n\nThe deep partisan divide over who bears responsibility for the partial shutdown and over the wall itself is likely to have contributed to the length of the standoff. Neither the president nor Democratic congressional leaders have shown any willingness to compromise. Republicans in Congress continue to show support for Trump’s positions.\n\nLast week, the talks broke down during a contentious meeting at the White House at which Trump walked out when told by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that she would continue to oppose the wall in border security negotiations, even if the government was reopened. As of this weekend, there is still no clear path ahead to end the shutdown.\n\nAt this point, most Americans say they are not feeling the effects of the shutdown. Eighteen percent say they have been inconvenienced, including 7 percent who say it has been a major problem.\n\nIf the shutdown continues for several months, as the president has threatened, 38 percent of Americans say they would consider that a crisis, 41 percent say it would be a serious problem but not a crisis, and 18 percent say it would not be a serious problem.\n\nPartisan differences also shape the choices ahead. Of the 54 percent of Americans who oppose the wall, 27 percent say Democrats should continue to resist Trump’s demands for $5.7 billion for a barrier, and 23 percent say Democrats should compromise with the president.\n\nOf those 42 percent who support the wall, 24 percent say Trump should continue to demand the level of funding he has asked for, and 16 percent say he should strike a deal with the Democrats.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, Democrats appear somewhat more conciliatory than Republicans. The poll finds that 42 percent of Democrats who oppose the wall say congressional Democrats should refuse to budge even if it extends the shutdown; 37 percent say they should compromise with Trump. Among Republicans, 58 percent both support the wall and say Trump should continue to demand funding, compared with 22 percent who say he should compromise to end the shutdown.\n\nTrump has threatened repeatedly to declare a national emergency to break the stalemate and to order the start of construction of a wall, although on Friday, he retreated from his previously aggressive rhetoric by noting that he is not ready to take such a step now.\n\nThe president faces sizable opposition from the public were he to do so. By more than 2-1 (66 percent to 31 percent), Americans say they oppose invoking an emergency to build a border wall. The poll finds 51 percent say they strongly oppose such a declaration. However, two-thirds of Republicans would support the president’s decision to use those powers.\n\nIn his nationally televised address he delivered from the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump asserted that there is a humanitarian and security crisis at the border because of illegal immigration. Nearly half of all Americans (47 percent) say there is a serious problem at the border but decline to call it a crisis. Just under a quarter (24 percent) label the current situation a crisis.\n\nAlmost half of all Republicans (49 percent) say the situation at the border is a crisis, and 43 percent say it is serious but not a crisis. Among Democrats, just 7 percent say the situation amounts to a crisis, and 52 percent say conditions are serious. Roughly one-fifth of independents agree with Trump’s characterization, and about half say things are serious but are not a crisis.\n\nThe Post-ABC poll was conducted Jan. 8-11 among a random national sample of 788 Americans reached on cellular and land­line phones. The overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.\n\nEmily Guskin contributed to this report.",

        "text": "January 14, 2019 - U.S. Voters Back Dem Plan To Reopen Government 2-1, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; More U.S. Voters Say Trump TV Address Was Misleading\n\nPDF format\n\nTrend Information\n\nSample and Methodology detail\n\n\n\nAmerican voters support 63 - 30 percent a Democratic proposal to reopen parts of the government that do not involve border security while negotiating funding for the Wall, according to a Quinnipiac University National Poll released today. Every party, gender, education, age and racial group supports this idea except Republicans, who are opposed 52 - 39 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nVoters oppose 63 - 32 percent shutting down the government to force funding for the Wall, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University National Poll finds. Again, Republicans are the only listed group supporting the shutdown, 67 - 24 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GOP is losing the battle as 56 percent of American voters say President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are responsible for the shutdown, while 36 percent say Democrats are responsible.\n\n\n\n\n\nVoters remain solidly opposed to a wall on the Mexican border, 55 - 43 percent, and reject every argument for the Wall. The 55 - 43 percent opposition compares to 54 - 43 percent opposition in a December 18 survey, just before the partial government shutdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican voters are negative in every question about the wall, saying:\n\n59 - 40 percent that it is not a good use of taxpayer dollars;\n\n55 - 43 percent that the wall would not make the U.S. safer;\n\n59 - 40 percent that the wall is not necessary to protect the border;\n\n52 percent say the wall is against American values as 41 percent say the wall is consistent with American values.\n\nThere is a security crisis along the Mexican border, American voters say 54 - 43 percent, and voters say 68 - 26 percent there is a humanitarian crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"'Mr. President, it's on you,' voters say about the government shutdown, blaming President Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans more than Democrats,\" said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And while they believe there is both a humanitarian and a security crisis along the southern border, they absolutely don't think a wall will solve the problem,\" Malloy added.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican voters support 61 - 32 percent a bill to fund new border security measures without funding the Wall. Republicans are the only listed group opposed to this idea, 57 - 36 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump's TV address to the nation last week was \"mostly misleading,\" 49 percent of American voters say, while 32 percent say it was \"mostly accurate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVoters are divided on the response by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as 38 percent found it \"mostly accurate\" and 39 percent found it \"mostly misleading.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican voters believed Pelosi/Schumer more than Trump 46 - 36 percent, including 48 - 33 percent among independent voters.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly 2 percent of voters say the TV address changed their mind, while 89 percent say it did not change their mind about building the Wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When it comes to the televised arguments for and against the need for a border wall, President Donald Trump flunks the fact meter, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer don't fare much better,\" Malloy said.\n\n\n\n\n\nVoters disapprove 65 - 32 percent of President Trump using emergency executive powers to fund the Wall.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy a narrow 49 - 44 percent American voters trust Democrats in Congress more than Trump on the issue of border security.\n\n\n\n\n\nVoters say 63 - 29 percent that undocumented immigrants are not more likely than American citizens to commit crimes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican voters say 73 - 16 percent, including 57 - 28 percent among Republicans, that immigration is good for the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom January 9 - 13, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,209 voters nationwide with a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points, including the design effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts gold standard surveys using random digit dialing with live interviewers calling landlines and cell phones.

        "text": "(CNN) During the longest government shutdown in US history, President Donald Trump has been losing support among those who may be his strongest supporters -- white Americans who don't have college degrees.\n\nAmong this group, only 45% said they approved of the job Trump is doing as President, according to a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS. That is the lowest level of support among this subgroup by 1 percentage point in CNN's surveys and a dip from a poll conducted in early December, before the partial shutdown, when 54% of whites without college degrees approved of his job as President and 39% disapproved.\n\nThe dip is notable since among whites who hold college degrees, Trump's ratings are largely unchanged in the last month and remain sharply negative -- 64% disapprove and 32% approve.\n\nThis trend is backed up by a new Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday. Approval for the President remained somewhat stable between its mid-December poll and now among whites without college degrees (down from 56% to 53%), but disapproval increased from 37% to 43%. That is going from a net 19% positive approval to a net 10% for Trump, a 9-point loss.\n\nThe January CNN poll f ound a majority of Americans placed most of the blame for the government shutdown on Trump (55%) over the Democrats in Congress (32%). Trump has tried to push back from his December claim that he would be proud to shut the government down.\n\nRead More",

        "text": "(CNN) How does the US federal government shutdown affect you? Not every federally funded agency, program and service will grind to a halt -- just those considered nonessential.\n\nSo if you had plans to visit any national parks, monuments or museums, some will be closed.\n\nHere's a look at how they might be impacted:\n\nNational parks\n\nZinke's decision to leave open as many park gates as possible means about two-thirds of the 417 national parks are still open to the public, according to the National Parks Conservation Association, an advocacy group.\n\nOpen-air parks, with their hiking trails and sprawling scenery, will largely remain open but will have limited services as about 21,000 of the park service's 24,000 staff members will be furloughed. Law enforcement personnel considered essential will be working, but rangers, gift shop and restroom staff will not, for example.\n\nPhotos: Yellowstone: Our first national park Photos: Yellowstone: Our first national park Yellowstone: Our first national park – Yellowstone National Park was the nation's first national park, established by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872. It's predominantly in Wyoming but also touches Idaho and Montana. Check in next week for Arches National Park Hide Caption 1 of 9 Photos: Yellowstone: Our first national park Yellowstone: Our first national park – Old Faithful Geyser may be the most-famous \"resident\" of Yellowstone National Park, but park ranger Dan Hottle says there is much more to see at the 2.2 million-acre park. Hide Caption 2 of 9 Photos: Yellowstone: Our first national park Yellowstone: Our first national park – Meet our Yellowstone National Park ranger, Dan Hottle, and his 4-year-old son, Calder, shown here at Joffe Lake near the park's headquarters in Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyoming. Hide Caption 3 of 9 Photos: Yellowstone: Our first national park Yellowstone: Our first national park – Grand Prismatic Spring is Hottle's favorite spring in the park, and it's in Midway Geyser Basin about five miles from Old Faithful. When the light is right, hike up one of the mountains surrounding the spring and you'll see the steam change colors because of the spring's bacteria. Hide Caption 4 of 9 Photos: Yellowstone: Our first national park Yellowstone: Our first national park – There's a good chance of spotting wolves on the drive to the Lamar Valley, Hottle says. He likes to stop at a pullout about halfway to the valley and hike into the woods, where he can sometimes see a wolf or its pack. (Hottle found this wolf in his backyard.) Hide Caption 5 of 9 Photos: Yellowstone: Our first national park Yellowstone: Our first national park – Rangers plead with with visitors to pull off the road to shoot pictures of bison (shown here in the Lamar Valley) or other wildlife that call Yellowstone home. Travelers have been known to stop their cars in the middle of the road to look at the view, or worse: look sideways to admire the nature while driving. Hide Caption 6 of 9 Photos: Yellowstone: Our first national park Yellowstone: Our first national park – In elk mating season, which starts around September, the bulls come down from the mountains and gather up as many cows (female elk) as they can into harems. Shown here is a harem of 27 cows resting in Mammoth Hot Springs near the town post office. Visitors are cautioned to stay at least 25 yards away from the elk, which have been known to ram cars and trap people. Hide Caption 7 of 9 Photos: Yellowstone: Our first national park Yellowstone: Our first national park – Hottle recommends that hikers travel in groups of at least three, stay on designated trails, carry bear pepper spray and make noise as they hike to avoid surprising bears (mother bears can attack when surprised). He and his family have hiked \"every inch\" of Electric Peak, a nearly 11,000-foot mountain. Hide Caption 8 of 9 Photos: Yellowstone: Our first national park Glacier National Park – Hottle also loves visiting Glacier National Park in Montana, a nine-hour drive by car. \"There's a wildness about Glacier that makes it even more dangerous and adventurous than Yellowstone,\" he said. Glacier's Wild Goose Island is shown here. Hide Caption 9 of 9\n\nYellowstone National Park said the park was still accessible but government-run operations and facilities are closed. \"Visitors can also access commercial services in the interior of the park (e.g. at Old Faithful) only as long as concessioners provide funds for road grooming,\" it said on its website.\n\nRocky Mountain National Park said it was still accessible but with limited services and visitors would be entering at their own risk. \"Park visitors are advised to use extreme caution if choosing to enter Rocky Mountain National Park, as National Park Service personnel will not be available to provide guidance or assistance. Emergency services will be limited,\" it said.\n\nMount Rushmore National Memorial said NPS facilities were closed but concession facilities were operating, including parking, food and beverages and restrooms.\n\nThe US Fish and Wildlife Service, which has 566 refuges and 38 wetland management districts, said refuges requiring the presence of a federal employee or contractor would be closed.\n\nThe Rocky Mountain Arsenal NWR tweeted that First Creek Trail and perimeter trails would remain open, but it later said the majority of the refuge would be inaccessible due to an approaching storm and the inability to maintain roads and provide safe public access.\n\nBuildings\n\nThe National Park System also includes buildings such as Ford's Theater in Washington, where President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, and Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. Those buildings will be closed.\n\n\"We welcome your visits and pray/advocate for an expedient, humane conclusion to the government shutdown,\" the center said.\n\nThe King Center is open! Although the Center is within the King Historic District and #MLK National Historic Park, it is a separate entity. We welcome your visits and pray/advocate for an expedient, humane conclusion to the government shutdown. #CHIP #DACA #MLK50Forward #Atlanta pic.twitter.com/YORnz4Ual7 — The King Center (@TheKingCenter) January 20, 2018\n\nThe Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum said it would continue to operate normally -- though no National Park rangers would be on site. \"While the Memorial is an affiliated site of the National Park Service, it is privately owned and operated by the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation,\" it said.\n\nThe Manhattan Project tweeted: \"Some @MnhtnProjectNPS areas may be accessible, however access may change without notice, and there are no NPS-provided services,\" it said.\n\nNASA has closed off tours.\n\nOpen for business\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement Sunday that the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island would reopen Monday.\n\nThe state is using its tourism budget to fully fund personnel and operational costs at $65,000 per day, Cuomo said.\n\n\"The Statue of Liberty is a symbol of freedom and opportunity for all, and it is a gross injustice that this administration's dysfunction caused it to shut down,\" he said. \"New York State will not allow the vitriol of Washington to close the Statue of Liberty.\"\n\nThe Smithsonian said in a tweet that \"its museums, research centers, and the National Zoo\" will be open Monday.\n\n\"The Smithsonian can use prior year funds still available to us to do so. We will update our status beyond Monday as soon as we know,\" the tweet said.\n\nUpdate: The Smithsonian, including its museums, research centers & the National Zoo, will be OPEN Monday, Jan. 22.\n\n\n\nThe Smithsonian can use prior year funds still available to us to do so. We will update our status beyond Monday as soon as we know. #governmentshutdown — Smithsonian (@smithsonian) January 20, 2018\n\nPresident Lincoln's Cottage in Washington, D.C. tweeted that it would be open despite the shutdown.\n\nIt even offered federal employees a discount, saying: \"Federal employees, all this week we're running a deal. Bring your federal ID/business card and tickets are $12.50 #GovShutdown.\"\n\nFederal employees, all this week we're running a deal.

That deal included a 10-14 year path to citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers, as well as permanent status and full protections afforded to all US citizens.\n\nThat deal could have included a wall, and Sen. Chuck Schumer privately promised as much as $20 billion to Trump in exchange for a path to citizenship for eligible immigrants.\n\nThe proposal had 54 votes in the Senate at the time, but Trump rejected that bipartisan proposal and threatened a veto.\n\nNow, the White House is offering the BRIDGE Act. When it was originally proposed, the bill offered temporary protections while a long term sustainable deal was hatched. Democrats were much more open to a deal back then because they didn't have a majority in the House.\n\nThe bottom line: Trump's latest proposal isn't nearly as good of a deal for either side. For Democrats, it's a temporary solution for DACA and TPS recipients. For the President, it's far less funding for the wall than what he turned down ($5.7 billion vs. $25 billion).",

        "text": "Hillary Clinton unveiled her big plan to curb the worst of Wall Street's excesses on Thursday. The reaction from the banking community was a shrug, if not relief.\n\nWhile Clinton proposes some harsher regulations, she stops far short of what more populist Democrats like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren want to do to Wall Street.\n\nSanders and Warren think the big banks should be broken up. Clinton does not. It's a big divide in the Democratic party.\n\n\"We continue to believe Clinton would be one of the better candidates for financial firms,\" wrote Jaret Seiberg of Guggenheim Partners in a note to clients analyzing her plan.\n\nClinton's big push is for more accountability on Wall Street. But she does that by proposing a tweak to what is currently in place, not a major overhaul like Sanders.\n\n\"To prevent irresponsible behavior on Wall Street from ever again devastating Main Street, we need more accountability, tougher rules and stronger enforcement,\" she wrote in an opinion piece for Bloomberg Thursday.\n\nRelated: Bad sign for Hillary: Bernie is selling more shirts\n\nHillary Clinton's plan for Wall Street\n\nShe has four major initiatives:\n\n1. Go after more bad guys. Clinton would give prosecutors more time to go after banks or people for financial wrongdoing -- from five to 10 years. She would also push for bank CEOs and other top executives to have more of their bonus money paid out over time. That way those bonuses could be scaled back if bad practices come to light.\n\n2. Tax (some) high-frequency traders. More and more trading is done by speedy computers used by high-frequency traders. There's a big debate about how helpful or harmful they are. Clinton is proposing a tax only on high-frequency traders who cancel a lot of orders -- the financial world's equivalent of a fake out.\n\n3. Keep Dodd-Frank in place and enhance the Volcker rule. Clinton is very clear that, unlike many Republican candidates, she would keep the financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank. She would also strengthen the Volcker rule by ending a provision that allows banks to invest up to 3% of their capital in hedge funds. Clinton thinks that encourages too much risky behavior.\n\n4. Crack down on \"shadow banking.\" This is a term often used for hedge funds and other non-bank players in the financial world. Their influence is growing and Clinton wants to put them under more regulation.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton: Workers should get bigger piece of company profits\n\nWall Street is comfortable with Clinton approach\n\nAmerica's largest banks and financial firms would likely have to make some changes under Clinton's plans, but they have been doing that since Dodd-Frank was passed in 2009.\n\n\"To us, [Clinton's] overall plan demonstrates an understanding of the financial system that we have not previously seen on the campaign trail,\" Seiberg wrote.\n\nPart of the reason Wall Street has some comfort with Clinton is because of her advisers. When it comes to financial issues, she has often turned to Gary Gensler, a former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair, and former Congressman Barney Frank, the co-author of Dodd-Frank. The financial world knows both of them well.\n\nWall Street also takes comfort because of the record of President Bill Clinton. He turned out to be very moderate on economic and financial issues, and stocks soared under his tenure.\n\nClinton's rivals want to go much further\n\nSanders and Warren, who isn't running but casts a shadow over Democratic policies about Wall Street, argue that banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) are still \"too big too fail.\" Former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, a 2016 contender, is in their camp as well. O'Malley criticized Clinton's plan for \"falling short.\"\n\nThey think the only way to ensure those banks never need a taxpayer bailout again is to make them smaller by reinstating a law know as the Glass-Steagall Act, which Bill Clinton abolished in the 1990s when he was president.\n\nIn short, the Glass-Steagall Act prevents banks from doing both Main Street type activities like lending to people for their homes and small businesses, and Wall Street type activities like trading. Having that wall in place kept banks more focused and smaller.\n\nClinton doesn't want to bring back Glass-Steagall, but she does propose a \"risk fee\" on the largest financial institutions. The details are thin, but she implies that any bank with assets over $50 billion would have to pay some sort of penalty.\n\nWhile Clinton looks moderate compared to some of her colleagues, she is distancing herself from Republican rivals.\n\nOn the GOP side, numerous candidates including Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio have said they will repeal the Dodd-Frank law because it is too harsh on banks and stifling the economy.",

        "text": "The probability of the Federal Reserve hiking rates today is 0%. So what about the rest of the year?\n\nFed Chair Janet Yellen keeps telling the world that any further rate hikes will be \"data dependent.\" Watch the numbers on wages, jobs, inflation, financial markets and China. The rosier it looks, the more likely the Fed will raise rates.\n\nBut there's one big factor this year that the Fed rarely mentions: the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe Fed has a lot of power over the economy and stock markets. How the economy fares could sway the election outcome. Former President George H. W. Bush pins his 1992 election loss on former Fed chair Alan Greenspan.\n\nRaising rates too soon can also rattle the stock markets. It can also crush consumer and business confidence. Any economic pullback would likely hurt a Democrat's chances to win the White House. That's the reason why Donald Trump has blasted the Fed for manipulating interest rates to help Obama.\n\nYellen bristles at any suggestion of such impropriety.\n\n\"I have never seen political views in any way influence the policy judgments that are made inside the Federal Reserve,\" Yellen said in March when asked about it.\n\nRelated: Has the Federal Reserve messed up?\n\nBut the question remains: would the Yellen Fed, which is already cautious, really pull the trigger to raise rates before Election Day? After April, five Fed meetings remain this year: June 15, July 27, September 21, November 2 and December 14. Four of those occur before voters go to the polls.\n\nBeyond what Trump says, a lot of eyebrows were raised when Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed's committee that sets interest rates, donated $2,700 to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The Fed didn't comment for this story.\n\nTrump blasts the Fed for bias\n\nTrump, in an interview with The Hill in the fall, accused Yellen of keeping rates low because \"Obama doesn't want to have a recession-slash-depression during his administration.\"\n\nExperts who have watched the Fed for years (or served on it) say Trump is off on this one.\n\n\"There's no definitive evidence that suggests the Fed is putting its thumb on the scale\" to help any particular party or candidate, says Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and political science professor at George Washington University.\n\nThe history of the Fed\n\nBut President George H. W. Bush disagrees.\n\n\"I think that if the interest rates had been lowered more dramatically that I would have been re-elected president because the [economic] recovery that we were in would have been more visible,\" Bush told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThere are even more questions around Richard Nixon. White House transcripts reveal heated conversations between Nixon and then Fed chair Arthur Burns. Nixon pressured Burns to pump more money into the economy, which the Fed did heading into the 1972 election.\n\nThe Fed has raised and lowered rates many times during election years. There are always economic reasons for the actions, making it hard to argue political bias was a decisive factor.\n\nThe influence of Election 2016 on the Fed could be more subtle.\n\nRelated: Americans give the economy a \"C\" grade\n\nPressure to hold rates low?\n\n\"I wonder if there's a subconscious bias,\" says Tim Kane, an economist at the Hoover Institution.\n\nHe notes that the economic talk on the 2016 campaign trail from both parties has been overwhelmingly negative. It creates pressure on the Fed to keep rates low to boost the economy. The current key interest rate bandwidth is at a mere 0.25% to 0.5%.\n\nHeading into 2016, the Fed implied it would raise rates four times this year. That's already been scaled back to just two.\n\nRelated: U.S. weekly jobless claims hit 42-year low\n\nFed defends its independence\n\nThe Fed has long defended its independence from politics. The building may be located on Constitution Avenue in Washington D.C., just a few blocks from the White House and Congress, but the Fed argues it acts based on economic data, not polling data.\n\nBloomberg first broke the news of Fed governor Brainard's contribution to the Clinton campaign. She has given the highest donation possible for an individual.\n\n\"When I was appointed [to the Fed], I chose not to participate in politics in any way,\" says Mark Olson, who served on the Fed's policy setting committee from 2001 to 2006, and is now chair of Treliant Risk Advisors.\n\nWhat Brainard did was legal and her political leanings aren't a surprise since she worked in the Obama administration. But Olson, a Republican, says the expectation is for Fed members not to do anything to create a perception of bias, especially political bias.\n\nRelated: Helicopter money: central banks' last resort\n\nJune move?\n\nIf caution and perception are the guiding principles of the Yellen Fed, it could be difficult for the Fed to act too close to the election. That raises the stakes even more for a June move.",

        "text": "Donald Trump argues that America loses big time on trade.\n\n\"The great American middle class is disappearing. One of the factors driving this economic devastation is America's disastrous trade policies,\" Trump wrote in a new op-ed in USA Today.\n\nHe says he'll use his deal making skills to turn America back into a winner in trade with China, Mexico and others.\n\nBut business leaders and economists from both sides of the aisle warn Trump's idea to slap hefty fees on Chinese and Mexican imports -- as much as 45% -- would be disastrous for the economy.\n\nHere's a rundown of Trump's key arguments on trade. Exit polls show the issue is winning Trump votes. He hopes it will lead to victory in Ohio in a close matchup with Governor John Kasich.\n\nRelated: Donald J. Trump ties and suits are made in China\n\n1. Trump's claim: Trade is killing jobs\n\n\"The American worker is being crushed\" by trade, Trump says. As proof, he cites research from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute that found America has lost 900,000 jobs to Mexico since the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in late 1993.\n\nThe job losses are the subject of a huge debate. Other research by the right-leaning U.S. Chamber of Commerce says 5 million U.S. jobs have been created because of NAFTA.\n\nRegardless, this discussion ignores the impact of technology and innovation on traditional middle class jobs.\n\n\"Trade is a factor, but technological change has been more important,\" says Robert Lawrence, professor of international trade at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Computers and robots are replacing manufacturing jobs. The predictions are that even more positions -- including \"highly skilled\" ones -- will be replaced by robots in the coming years.\n\nTrump says \"I am the only candidate in this race who will bring our manufacturing jobs back,\" but he doesn't seem to be addressing the real cause of the decline in manufacturing jobs: machines.\n\nRelated: Is trade really killing middle class jobs?\n\n2. Trump: Ohio has lost 100,000 jobs to trade\n\nIn his op-ed, Trump argues that states like Ohio have been especially hard hit by trade. \"An Economic Policy Institute analysis found that Ohio has already lost more than 100,000 jobs to Trans-Pacific Partnership countries,\" he writes.\n\nHere's the catch: Ohio has a 4.9% unemployment rate, meaning the state is basically at full employment. While it's true that some jobs have been lost, others are being created. For example, Ohio has benefited from America's energy boom and a resurgence of steel jobs to make the pipes to transport natural gas.\n\nRelated: How Donald Trump could cause a recession\n\n3. Trump's plan: The art of the (trade) deal\n\nTrump solution is to renegotiate trade agreements (the U.S. currently has 20 free-trade deals in place) and put taxes (known as tariffs) on Chinese and Mexican imports.\n\nThe idea is to make Chinese and Mexican goods more expensive so companies will start manufacturing in the U.S. again.\n\nThe problem is China and Mexico aren't likely to send Trump a thank you note. They would probably retaliate by putting taxes on U.S. goods coming into their countries. It could cause a global trade war.\n\n\"His plan to put on a 35% tariff on goods imported would sink this country into a recession. It would penalize global companies that are trying to be competitive globally,\" HP Enterprises (HPE) CEO Meg Whitman, a prominent Republican, said recently.\n\nThe American Action Forum, a right-leaning think tank, estimates that Trump's tariffs on China would cost Americans an average of $675 per person a year. (The Mexico tariff would cost over $100 a person).\n\nRelated: The Trump business that failed in two years\n\n4. Trump says stop the TPP trade deal\n\nTrump has a big warning about the future: \"The situation is about to get drastically worse if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is not stopped. One of the first casualties of the TPP will be America's auto industry, and among the worst victims of this pact will be the people of Ohio.\"\n\nHe points out that his rivals for the Republican nomination -- Gov. Kasich, Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio -- all support TPP.\n\nTPP is a trade agreement that's been years in the making. It would create a free trade zone around the Pacific Ocean, bringing together 12 countries that account for 40% of the world's economy. China is not part of the agreement, so the deal could help contain China's economic influence.\n\nThere's a lot of debate about whether TPP will help or hurt U.S. jobs and businesses. Much like with NAFTA, there will likely be some industries that benefit and some that are hurt. The U.S. auto industry is actually expected to be one of the winners from the deal.\n\nRelated: Why Americans are so angry in 2016\n\nThe bottom line\n\nBashing trade is helping Trump win votes. But both Republican and Democratic experts warn his plan to \"fix\" trade deals could cause an economic war that leaves Americans even worse off.",

This time, Donald Trump claims that if he is elected president, he will get Apple to make its gadgets in America.\n\n\"We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,\" Trump said Monday at a speech at Liberty University in Virginia.\n\nThere are a few nuances to the issue that Trump is missing.\n\nThere actually is a lot of America in Apple products\n\nIPhone and iPad displays are made by Corning in a Kentucky factory. The processors are made by Samsung in Austin and GlobalFoundries in Malta, New York.\n\nThe cell and Wi-Fi radios are made in Fort Collins, Colorado, by Avago Technologies.\n\nAnd Texas Instruments makes iPhone power management chips in Richardson (Texas, obviously).\n\nOf course, there are plenty of Chinese companies that make other parts of the iPhone. But Apple claims it works with 8,000 different U.S. suppliers from 31 states for its products.\n\nChina is the location of the final step: the assembly of the iPhone and other Apple (AAPL) products.\n\nEven then, Apple does some production in the United States. Some of its iMacs are assembled in California, and all of its Mac Pros are put together in a facility in Austin.\n\nSo Apple is already building many of its damn computers in this country.\n\nIt's not possible to assemble all Apple products in the United States\n\nApple isn't going to shift all of its manufacturing to the United States. That's not going to happen any time soon, no matter who is elected president.\n\nApple has said that it directly employs thousands of its own workers in China, and about 700,000 assembly workers at manufacturing contractors like Foxconn (HNHPF) put together Apple products, according to the most recent data. It would be almost impossible to bring those jobs to the United States.\n\nUnlike U.S. plants, Foxconn and other Chinese manufacturing operations house employees in dormitories and can send hundreds of thousands of workers to the assembly lines at a moment's notice. On the lines, workers are subjected to what most Americans would consider unbearably long hours and tough working conditions. And they make about $17 a day, according to the Fair Labor Association.\n\nThen there's the issue of engineers and skilled workers. Apple executives claim there aren't enough American workers with the training necessary to oversee its complex manufacturing process.\n\nIt's not just Apple. A constant gripe of U.S. technology companies is that American schools don't produce enough engineers with the skills they're looking for.\n\nThe China issue came up in the 2012 campaign too, when President Obama and Mitt Romney sparred over the issue.",

In October he told The Hill that he thought Americans were \"being forced into an inflated stock market and at some point they'll get wiped out.\"\n\nSo what do the experts think?\n\n\"I agree with them that the market is very richly valued. At some point there will be an adjustment,\" says Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network.\n\nBut McMillan believes it's too extreme to call it a bubble. The U.S. economy is still in decent shape, he says, and valuations aren't wildly high.\n\nRelated: Oil hits new 2016 high\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates to historically low levels -- near 0% -- at the end of 2008 to try to jumpstart the economy after the financial crisis. Only as recently as December did the Fed raise interest rates a tiny bit: 0.25%.\n\nLow rates encourage people to put more money into the stock market since they earn so little interest by saving their money in the bank.\n\nTrump has suggested that Fed chair Janet Yellen is trying to help President Obama's economic track record.\n\n\"Janet Yellen for political reasons is keeping interest rates so low that the next guy or person who takes over as president could have a real problem,\" Trump said.\n\nRelated: Janet Yellen disagrees strongly with Bernie Sanders\n\nExperts say America is NOT in a bubble\n\nYellen dismisses assertions that the U.S. is in an economic or financial bubble.\n\n\"This is an economy on a solid course, not a bubble economy,\" Yellen said last week.\n\nThe stock market hit its highest level in 2016 this week. It's not far from its all-time high that occurred in May of last year.\n\nMost investment and economic experts think Cruz and Trump are far too gloomy. Stock prices are higher than they're historic norm, but they aren't at extremes like the dot-com bubble.\n\nIn order for the stock market to undergo a dramatic decline of 20% or more, it usually takes one (or more) of three shock factors: the economy falling into recession, a mistake by the Fed or oil and other commodity prices spiking.\n\n\"Right now we don't have any of those three aggravating factors,\" says McMillian.\n\nHillary Clinton viewed as best for the stock market\n\nInvestors believe Hillary Clinton would be the best for the stock market, although Trump is a close second.\n\nEarlier this month, E*Trade and CNNMoney polled 907 investors with at least $10,000 in online brokerage accounts. Twenty-eight percent said Clinton would be best for stocks. A quarter felt Trump would be the ideal for the market. Only 8% thought Cruz would.",

        "text": "The United States and 11 other nations have finally reached a long-sought agreement on a controversial free-trade pact.\n\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, would knock down tariffs and import quotas, making it cheaper to import and export, and open new Asia-Pacific markets to American companies. Negotiations have been going on for years.\n\n\"We have successfully concluded the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\" U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said Monday.\n\nCritics say the trade deal will shift more jobs and business operations overseas, as U.S. businesses seek to benefit from lower wage workers in developing economies.\n\n\"Wall Street and other big corporations have won again,\" said 2016 hopeful Bernie Sanders. \"It is time for the rest of us to stop letting multinational corporations rig the system to pad their profits at our expense.\"\n\nProponents say it will make it easier for U.S. businesses to sell overseas, opening up overseas markets the way the U.S. market is already open to imports from these 11 other countries. And they say that the growth of U.S. exports will produce well-paying jobs at home.\n\nThe TPP is a central focus of President Obama's trade agenda, and something he has pushed for since the start of his presidency. The agreement must be approved by Congress and the other countries' legislatures before it can take effect.\n\nThe countries taking part -- Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the U.S. and Vietnam -- together make up 40% of the world's economy.\n\nThe U.S. and Japan -- the first and third largest economies in the world -- have anchored the talks.\n\nChina, the No. 2 economy, is not part of the TPP. Proponents hope an agreement could neutralize some of China's power in global trade. But there is also the expectation that China and other major Pacific nations, such as South Korea, could eventually be brought into the free trade zone.\n\nIn a statement, China's Commerce Ministry described the deal as \"significant,\" and expressed hope that the TPP \"will promote other free trade agreements within the region.\"\n\nTrade deals are always political and business lightning rods because they create winners and losers. The North American Free Trade Agreement, put in place in 1994, still sparks fierce debate.\n\nThe TPP is no different. Froman, the U.S. trade chief who led the latest round of talks, said the negotiators were still hammering out the deal's language at 5 a.m. ET Monday, just hours before the announcement.\n\nOne contentious issue has been how long pharmaceutical companies should be allowed to control information about the medicine they develop. The U.S. pushed for longer terms, but other countries like Australia want shorter ones.\n\nDrug companies say longer periods of exclusivity over research encourages investment in developing cures. But longer terms can also keep cheaper versions off the market. The potential for compromise over this issue was reportedly a final key to a deal.\n\nAmong the TPP's leading backers are the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the powerful business lobby that isn't often on the same side of big issues as Obama.\n\nObama says the TPP would make American companies more competitive, create jobs in the U.S. and add billions to the global economy. Froman said it removes 18,000 tariffs that U.S. businesses now face when trying to sell their products overseas.\n\n\"TPP represents 18,000 tax cuts,\" he said Monday.\n\nNike (NKE) has said it would create 10,000 U.S. jobs if an agreement is finalized.\n\nEarlier this year, Obama pushed a bill through Congress that gives him \"fast track\" authority, also known as trade promotion authority. The fast track process is designed to make it easier for a president to get congressional approval of trade pacts and was seen as a big opening on future passage of the TPP.\n\nHowever, the TPP has met with harsh criticism -- from both sides of the political aisle.\n\nDemocrats and labor unions, led by the AFL-CIO, say it could hurt American workers because they believe it will make it easier for U.S. businesses to shift jobs overseas.\n\nCritics have also wanted details about the negotiations, which have been done in private, to be made public. Wikileaks has published draft documents that were otherwise top secret.\n\nThe TPP has also been a headline issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump blasted it in a tweet on Monday: \"The incompetence of our current administration is beyond comprehension. TPP is a terrible deal.\"\n\n-- CNN's Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.",

The rest were split between John Kasich, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio (who has since dropped out of the race).\n\nRelated: Would 'President Donald Trump' be good or bad for stocks?\n\nIt didn't matter how much money they have invested, more people across all asset levels ranging from $10,000 to more than $500,000 said Clinton.\n\nBut more men said Trump would be better for investors than the Democratic front-runner, by about 3 percentage points. Nearly 25% of men said Trump would be better for the stock market than any other candidate, but only 15% of women agreed.\n\nRelated: Are Trump and Sanders hurting the economy?\n\nWhy would investors think Clinton would be better for the stock market? They don't like uncertainty, and she appears to be \"a little bit more of a known entity than the other candidates,\" said Scott Kolman, a finance lecturer at San Diego State University.\n\nWhile Trump supporters consider him to be a successful businessman, others don't know what to expect if the \"outsider\" wins the White House.\n\nAnd historically, Democrats have been better for stock market performance. The S&P 500 gained an average of 9.7% annually under Democrats since 1945, compared to 6.7% under Republican presidents.\n\nSome, like UCLA economist David Shulman, believe a Hillary win has already been priced into the market.\n\nRelated: How Hillary Clinton's tax plan would hit the rich\n\nTo Shulman, Trump and Sanders would be the worst for markets because they promise to enact a \"fundamental change\" in policy.\n\nTrump has threatened to start a trade war with China and Mexico, slapping fees on imports to make them more expensive. Sanders talks of breaking up the big banks and creating new taxes.\n\nRelated: What we know about Trump's money\n\nStill, we don't know how much of their stump speeches would come to fruition if they win the oval office. Some don't believe the election will have much of an impact on stocks at all.\n\n\"Both will impact the market to some extent, but long term I don't see either Trump or Clinton influencing it as much as some may think,\" said CFP Andy Tate.",

        "text": "Americans' confidence in the economy is sinking.\n\nIt's at its lowest level so far in 2016, according to the weekly survey known as the Gallup U.S. Economic Confidence Index.\n\nIn fact, people's perceptions of the economy haven't been this poor since late August when stock markets around the world were crashing and there were fears China might be slipping into a deep downturn.\n\nIt was clear why people were anxious in August. It's not so clear now. The U.S. stock market has rebounded and is within striking distance of new records. Hiring remains strong and home prices are rising.\n\nYet Americans don't see brighter days ahead: 60% say the economy is \"getting worse,\" according to Gallup.\n\n\"My biggest concern is that we continue to bleed momentum,\" says Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel. The U.S. economy only grew 0.5% in the first three months of the year -- far below the 2% average in recent years.\n\nRelated: U.S. economy only grows 0.5% in Q1\n\nBlame Election 2016?\n\nSome blame the U.S. presidential candidates for their negative rhetoric and making people feel worse about the economy -- and their futures -- than the reality. Voters of both parties overwhelmingly cite the economy as their No. 1 concern in exit polls.\n\nDonald Trump doesn't just bash the economy, he portrays it as a \"loser.\"\n\nEven the Democratic presidential candidates have been talking down the economy. Hillary Clinton says right on her campaign website, \"Our country is standing again, but we're not yet running.\" Bernie Sanders goes further, proclaiming the economy is rigged and the middle class is \"collapsing.\"\n\nBut there is likely something deeper going on than politics. After all, Gallup's economic confidence measure started to really dip in mid-March. By then, the candidates had been slamming the economy for months.\n\nRelated: Americans give the economy a \"C\" grade\n\nEconomic reality check is hitting\n\nHere's an economic reality check: Incomes for the lower middle class and middle class still aren't showing much sign of a pickup. In 2014 and, especially, 2015, people were told not too worry: more people were getting jobs and the economy was gaining momentum. Raises would soon follow.\n\nBut that isn't happening at a healthy pace. As a result, Americans appear to be more cautious on how they spend their dollars.\n\nRetail spending fell 0.3% in March. And gas prices, while still incredibly cheap, have crept up 13 cents a gallon in the past month, another red flag for consumers.\n\n\"Optimism is waning now. People aren't pessimistic, but more realistic,\" says Piegza.\n\nRelated: How I went from middle class to homeless\n\nAmerica needs a spring and summer bounce\n\nHow Americans feel about the economy actually matters a lot -- for Election 2016 and for what happens to growth the rest of the year. That's why the consumer confidence gauges are getting more attention than usual.\n\nIt's not just Gallup showing a dip. The Conference Board asks people what they think will happen to U.S. business in the next six months and the results show that they are less optimistic. The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Expectations is also down 10% from last April.\n\nThese aren't massive dips. Confidence isn't as low as it was in the worst of the Great Recession, but the downward trend is concerning.\n\nThe United States often goes through a winter slump that is followed by a spring and summer bump. Getting that boost will depend largely on whether Americans feel good enough about their finances to go out and spend at restaurants, shops and tourist sites.",

        "text": "Hillary Clinton has often said she wants the rich to pay their \"fair share.\" Translation: More.\n\nAnd the bevy of tax proposals she's put forth so far would certainly raise the tax burden of the country's highest earners, according to a new analysis from the Tax Policy Center.\n\nBut figuring out their taxes also would be made more cumbersome.\n\n\"[Clinton's plan] would make the tax code more complex,\" said TPC director Len Burman.\n\nUnlike the tax proposals of Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, Clinton's proposals would not overhaul the current tax code drastically.\n\n\"It's not major reform,\" Burman noted.\n\nBut Clinton's plan also diverges notably from those of her Republican opponents, including Donald Trump, in another key way: It wouldn't explode the nation's debt. The Tax Policy Center estimates that the proposals she's put forth so far would reduce deficits in the first decade by $1.1 trillion and by another $2.1 trillion in the next decade.\n\nThe caveat: The Tax Policy Center analysis could not account for a yet-to-be-released Clinton proposal to cut taxes for low- and middle-income filers, which her campaign has said is forthcoming.\n\nHere are some key highlights from her plan to date:\n\nRaise income taxes on the wealthiest\n\nClinton's plan would make the tax code even more progressive than it is today.\n\nShe would impose the so-called Buffett Rule, requiring those with adjusted gross incomes over $1 million to pay a minimum of 30% of their income in taxes.\n\nOn top of that, she would impose a 4% surcharge on adjusted gross income over $5 million.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump's big tax cuts come at a big cost\n\nClinton would also limit the value of certain deductions and exclusions to 28%. That would reduce the benefit of those tax breaks for anyone in tax brackets higher than 28%.\n\nThese measures individually and combined would make figuring one's tax liability harder. For instance, filers would need to compare their tax bill under both the regular code and the Alternative Minimum Tax to what they would owe under the Buffett Rule, and pay whichever is highest.\n\n\"Tax preparation software makes such calculations manageable, but they would still make the already murky individual income tax even more opaque,\" the TPC analysis noted.\n\nHigh-income investors subject to higher capital gains taxes\n\nCapital gains are a big source of wealth for very high-income filers -- defined as those making more than $400,000.\n\nUnder today's tax code, they pay a 20% tax on realized gains from investments held more than a year. Clinton would preserve that rate, but only for investments held at least six years.\n\nUnder her plan, realized gains on investments held less than six years would be taxed on a sliding scale.\n\nInvestors would pay the ordinary income tax on investments held less than two years. Currently, that's only the case for investments held less than one year.\n\nThe top capital gains tax rate would then fall by about 4 percentage points each year thereafter until it reaches 20% in year six.\n\nOn top of the new capital gains tax rates, Clinton would preserve the current 3.8% in Medicare surtaxes that investors owe if their gains exceed a certain threshold.\n\nInvestment fund managers would pay more\n\nClinton wants so-called carried interest to be taxed as ordinary income.\n\nCarried interest is a portion of investment profits paid to managers of hedge funds, venture capital funds, and other private equity funds.\n\nCurrently those profits are taxed as capital gains at 20% (or 23.8% if the managers also owe the Medicare surtax). In either case, that is well below the 39.6% top rate individuals pay now on ordinary income.\n\nWith the Medicare surtax, investment managers would face a top rate of 43.4% on their carried interest under Clinton's plan.\n\nBig estates would face higher tax rates\n\nMoney and assets left to heirs would be taxed more heavily if they come from a big estate.\n\nClinton would tax estates worth more than $3.5 million ($7 million for married couples.) That's below today's estate tax exemption level of $5.45 million ($10.9 million for couples).\n\nShe would also raise the top estate tax rate to 45% from 40%.\n\nHow much more would the rich pay?\n\nThe report estimates that the top 1% of households would see their tax burden go up by more than $78,000 on average, reducing their after-tax income by 5%.\n\nThe top 1% are defined as households making more than $730,000, an amount that includes both taxable income and non-taxable income, such as tax-free bonds, 401(k) contributions and health insurance subsidies.\n\nAll told, the top 1% would pay more than three-quarters of Clinton's tax increases.\n\nThe vast majority of tax filers would see little change in their after-tax income -- at least under the plans she's unveiled so far.\n\nEconomic effects unclear\n\nClinton's higher tax rates on top earners may discourage their incentives to work, save and invest, the TPC analysis notes.\n\nBut the potentially negative economic impact may be offset depending on how lawmakers use the additional revenue raised.\n\nIf it's used to pay down debt, that could reduce interest rates, thereby increasing incentives to invest and supporting growth. Or the money could be spent in ways that stimulate the economy over the long run, such as on needed infrastructure projects.",

        "text": "Washington (CNN) Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, seems reluctant to take a firm position on an issue dividing her party: whether President Obama should have fast-track trading authority for the immense trade deal he has been negotiating, the Trans-Pacific Partnership . With some progressive voters eyeing her with some skepticism, and facing a challenge (such as it is) from candidates on her left, she is being advised to tack in that direction.\n\nPresident Obama has been pushing hard for the deal, while Democrats in the House of Representatives on Friday revolted and voted against a key part of the legislation. One told me, \"there was a very strong concern about the lost jobs and growing income inequality,\" adding, pointedly: \"Ms. Clinton should take notice.\"\n\nShe clearly did. After first dodging the issue, on Sunday in Iowa, Clinton said that \"the President should listen to and work with his allies in Congress, starting with (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi, who have expressed their concerns about the impact that a weak agreement would have on our workers, to make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible. And if we don't get it, there should be no deal.\"\n\nClinton said, \"there are some specifics in there that could and should be changed. So I am hoping that's what happens now -- let's take the lemons and turn it into lemonade.\"\n\nBut as members of the Obama administration can attest, Clinton was one of the leading drivers of the TPP when Secretary of State. Here are 45 instances when she approvingly invoked the trade bill about which she is now expressing concerns:\n\n\"First and foremost, this so-called pivot has been about creative diplomacy:Like signing a little-noted treaty of amity and cooperation with ASEAN that opened the door to permanent representation and ultimately elevated a forum for engaging on high-stakes issues like the South China Sea. We've encouraged India's \"Look East\" policy as a way to weave another big democracy into the fabric of the Asia Pacific. We've used trade negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership to find common ground with a former adversary in Vietnam. And the list goes on.\"\n\n\"We also discussed the Trans-Pacific Partnership and we shared perspectives on Japan's possible participation, because we think this holds out great economic opportunities to all participating nations.\"\n\n\"...let me offer five big-ticket agenda items that we absolutely have to get right as well. This starts with following through on what is often called our pivot to the Asia Pacific, the most dynamic region in our rapidly changing world. Much of the attention so far has been on America's increasing military engagement. But it's important that we also emphasize the other elements of our strategy. In a speech in Singapore last week, I laid out America's expanding economic leadership in the region, from new trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership to stepped-up efforts on behalf of American businesses.\"\n\n\"...We are welcoming more of our neighbors, including Canada and Mexico, into the Trans-Pacific Partnership process. And we think it's imperative that we continue to build an economic relationship that covers the entire hemisphere for the future.\"\n\n\"And with Singapore and a growing list of other countries on both sides of the Pacific, we are making progress toward finalizing a far-reaching new trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The so-called TPP will lower barriers, raise standards, and drive long-term growth across the region. It will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment. Better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions, including for women, migrant workers and others too often in the past excluded from the formal economy will help build Asia's middle class and rebalance the global economy. Canada and Mexico have already joined the original TPP partners. We continue to consult with Japan. And we are offering to assist with capacity building, so that every country in ASEAN can eventually join. We welcome the interest of any nation willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP, including China.\"\n\n\"...we need to keep upping our game both bilaterally and with partners across the region through agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP. Australia is a critical partner. This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment.\"\n\n\"Our diplomats work side by side at regional organizations to address shared security challenges and hammer out new economic agreements, and we congratulate Australia upon becoming a new nonpermanent member of the Security Council. Our growing trade across the region, including our work together to finalize the Trans-Pacific Partnership, binds our countries together, increases stability, and promotes security.\"\n\n\"That means finalizing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will lower trade barriers, raise labor and environmental standards, and drive growth across the region. And it includes, of course, working closely together at the upcoming East Asia Summit to advance a shared agenda.\"\n\n\"That means pushing governments to support high-standard trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, to drop harmful protectionist policies. It means playing by the rules, respecting workers, and opening doors qualified women. And most of all, it means doing what you do best: build, hire, and grow.\"\n\nPRIME MINISTER KEY: \"Secretary Clinton and I discussed the broad range of issues in the Asia Pacific region as we look towards the APEC summit in Russia in around 10 days time. New Zealand warmly supports the United States rebalancing towards the Asia-Pacific and we welcome the opportunities to cooperate further. In that context, we discussed our ongoing efforts to negotiate, alongside a number of other countries, a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.\"\n\n...\n\nSECRETARY CLINTON: \"I'm also very committed to expanding investment and trade in the region, in pursuit of sustainable economic growth. Later today, I'll meet with local pearl vendors from here in the Cook Islands who are running their businesses while also protecting marine resources.\"\n\n\"We've also made workers rights a centerpiece of a new far-reaching trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We are working with Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and others in these negotiations.\"\n\n\"So we're working on expanding it through a far-reaching, new regional trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would lower trade barriers while raising standards on everything from labor conditions to environmental protection to intellectual property. Both of our countries will benefit. And in fact, economists expect that Vietnam would be among the countries under the Trans-Pacific Partnership to benefit the most. And we hope to finalize this agreement by the end of the year.\"\n\n\"Domestic and international businesses alike continue to face rules that restrict their activities, and that, in turn, deters investment and slows growth. So we are encouraging the Government of Vietnam to keep on the path of economic and administrative reform to open its markets to greater private investment. And through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, we're working with Vietnam and seven other nations to lower trade barriers throughout the region, as we ensure the highest standards for labor, environmental, and intellectual property protections. Vietnam was an early entrant to the TPP, and we're hoping we can finalize the agreement this year. And the economic analysis is that of all the countries that will be participating -- Australia, Canada, Mexico, others -- of all the countries participating in the TPP, Vietnam stands to benefit the most. So we're hoping to really see this agreement finalized and then watch it take off.\"\n\n\"We also discussed the opportunity to strengthen our economic relationship, and the United States welcomes Japan's interest in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which we think will connect economies throughout the region, making trade and investment easier, spurring exports, creating jobs. The TPP is just one element of our increased focus on the Asia Pacific, but it is important that we recognize that the Japanese-American relationship is really at the cornerstone of everything we are doing in the Asia Pacific. We are not only treaty allies; we are friends and partners with common interests and shared values.\"\n\n\"Finally, we discussed the maturing economic relationship between our countries as well as our shared commitment to enhanced development, trade, and investment. We would like to see the Philippines join the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade community. The foreign secretary raised the Philippines' interest in seeking passage of the Save our Industries Act, and we have conveyed that message to the United States Congress.\"\n\n\"Now President Obama and I have said many times that this will be America's Pacific century, and we are focused on the broader Pacific. But remember, the Pacific runs from the Indian Ocean to the western shores of Latin America. We see this as one large area for our strategic focus. That's why we're working with APEC; that's why we're creating the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We recognize the mutual benefits of engagement between the Americas and the rest of the Pacific.\"\n\n\"As part of that same trip last November, the President built momentum for a new far-reaching trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership that we are negotiating with eight other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. This agreement is not just about eliminating barriers to trade, although that is crucial for boosting U.S. exports and creating jobs here at home. It's also about agreeing on the rules of the road for an integrated Pacific economy that is open, free, transparent, and fair. It will put in place strong protections for workers, the environment, intellectual property, and innovation -- all key American values. And it will cover emerging issues such as the connectivity of regional supply chains, the competitive impact of state-owned enterprises, and create trade opportunities for more small-and-medium-sized businesses.\"\n\n\"Big or small, we're standing up for an economic system that benefits everyone, like when our Embassy in Manila worked with Filipino authorities on new intellectual property protections or when our negotiators ensure that the new Trans-Pacific Partnership requires that state-owned enterprises compete under the same rules as private companies.\"\n\n\"This is a very consequential relationship. The multidimensional growth of our relationship with Singapore is an example of the importance that the United States sets on strengthening our engagement in the Asia Pacific. We are working together on a full range of issues, including moving forward on a high-quality trade agreement through the Trans-Pacific Partnership process.\"\n\n\"The minister and I also discussed a number of bilateral and regional issues and reviewed the close and ongoing collaboration between Japan and the United States in the aftermath of last March's earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear crisis. We discussed Japan's recent move to pursue consultations on joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations to resolve longstanding trade concerns in order to deepen the economic ties to the benefit of both our countries. I also urged that Japan take decisive steps so that it accedes to The Hague Convention on International Parental Child Abduction and address outstanding cases.\"\n\n\"Now let me describe briefly four ways that we want to work with you: first, by lowering trade barriers; second, by strengthening the investment climate; third, by pursuing commercial diplomacy; and fourth, by supporting entrepreneurs. We're excited about the innovative trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. That would bring economies from across the Pacific, developed and developing alike, into a single trading community, not only to create more growth, but better growth.\"\n\n\"Together we hope to deliver an array of benefits to the people, including more foreign investment to create new jobs, a more streamlined court system that can deliver justice and protect local businesses, better services, and more resources to fight poverty. Over time, these steps will better position the Philippines to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which we hope will dramatically increase trade and investment among the peoples of the Pacific.\"\n\n\"There is new momentum in our trade agenda with the recent passage of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement and our ongoing work on a binding, high-quality Trans-Pacific Partnership, the so-called TPP. The TPP will bring together economies from across the Pacific, developed and developing alike, into a single 21st century trading community. A rules-based order will also be critical to meeting APEC's goal of eventually creating a free trade area of the Asia Pacific.\"\n\nOne of America's great successes of the past century was to build a strong network of relationships and institutions across the Atlantic -- an investment that continues to pay off today. One of our great projects in this century will be to do the same across the Pacific. Our Free Trade Agreement with South Korea, our commitment to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, are clear demonstrations that we are not only a resident military and diplomatic power in Asia, we are a resident economic power and we are there to stay.\"\n\n\"We are working to encourage trade through the Trans-Pacific Partnership and through APEC, whose leaders the President will be hosting this fall in Hawaii. Together, we are strengthening regional institutions like the East Asia Summit and ASEAN. And as Secretary Panetta will explain, our military relationship is deepening and becoming even more consequential.\"\n\n\"That is the spirit behind the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the so-called TPP, which we hope to outline by the time of APEC in November, because this agreement will bring together economies from across the Pacific—developed and developing alike—into a single trading community.\"\n\n\"The United States is pushing forward on comprehensive trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and our free trade agreement with South Korea. We are also stepping up our commercial diplomacy and pursuing a robust economic agenda at APEC. India, for its part, has concluded or will soon conclude new bilateral economic partnerships with Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, and others. The more our countries trade and invest with each other and with other partners, the more central the Asia Pacific region becomes to global commerce and prosperity, and the more interest we both have in maintaining stability and security. As the stakes grow higher, we should use our shared commitment to make sure that we have maritime security and freedom of navigation. We need to combat piracy together. We have immediate tasks that we must get about determining.\"\n\n\"We looked ahead to the East Asia summit where President Obama will participate for the first time, and the United States will send our largest, most senior delegation ever to the Pacific Island Forum in New Zealand later this year. We talked about developments in Fiji, and both New Zealand and the United States agree that the military junta must take steps to return Fiji to democracy. And we agree on the importance of pursuing negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will provide a free trade agreement for nine countries across the region, including both of ours. We're making steady progress on this. We hope to be able to have the negotiations complete by the time we all meet in Hawaii for APEC toward the end of this year.\"\n\n\"And both of us understand the benefits of deeper economic integration and fair trade. Minister Rudd was very influential in helping us to work toward a greater, more relevant involvement in the Pacific-Asian institutions, such as joining the East Asian Summit. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is exploring ways to expand opportunity, is critical, and APEC and ASEAN are two other organizations where we work together.\"\n\n\"We will be hosting the 2011 APEC summit in Hawaii later this year. We are pushing to advance economic integration, remove trade barriers, and make sure that our national regulations line up in a way that encourages trade. We are also working hard on the trans-Pacific partnership, a cutting edge regional free trade agreement that would eventually cover an area responsible for over 40 percent of global trade.\"\n\n\"As countries step up on the global stage, they will make essential contributions to helping all of us meet some of those most important challenges. Mexico, for example, made a crucial contribution to the fight against climate change through its remarkable leadership in Cancun last year. Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina in the G-20; Chile and Mexico in the OECD; Chile and Peru in the Trans-Pacific Partnership; and along with Mexico in APEC, these are all helping to build a foundation for balanced global growth, a transparent global economy, and broad-based opportunity. \"\n\n\"The United States is also making important progress on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will bring together nine APEC economies in a cutting-edge, next generation trade deal, one that aims to eliminate all trade tariffs by 2015 while improving supply change, saving energy, enhancing business practices both through information technology and green technologies. To date, the TPP includes Brunei, Chile, New Zealand, Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, Peru, Vietnam and the United States.\"\n\n\"We are taking steps to ensure that our defense posture reflects the complex and evolving strategic environment in the region and we are working to ratify a free trade agreement with South Korea and pursuing a regional agreement through the Trans-Pacific Partnership to help create new opportunities for American companies and support new jobs here at home. Those goals will be front and center when we host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in Hawaii later this year.\"\n\n\"Now, we've seen how bilateral trade benefits both sides. Our challenge now is to broaden those benefits. That means we have to look for even more opportunities to increase trade and investment between us. And it means that we work harder to broaden the benefits of trade even beyond our two countries. Australia is an important partner in negotiating the ambitious new multilateral trade deal called the Trans Pacific Partnership. Over time, we hope to deliver a groundbreaking agreement that connects countries as diverse as Peru and Vietnam with America and Australia to create a new free trade zone that can galvanize commerce, competition, and growth across the entire Pacific region.\"\n\n\"To continue this progress, we are both pressing ahead on something called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It's an ambitious multilateral free trade agreement that would bring together many more nations of the Pacific Rim. Australia and the United States are helping to lead those negotiations and we're also working through APEC, which the United States will host in Hawaii in 2011. We see that as a pivotal year to drive progress on internal economic changes that will open more markets and make sure that any growth is more sustainable and inclusive. And finally, we believe that the United States and Australia have been at the forefront of organize the entire region for the future.\"\n\n\"We are looking for ways to broaden and deepen our economic ties and build on the strong foundation we already have. And we think that the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a very exciting opportunity. This multilateral free trade agreement would bring together nine countries located in the Asia Pacific region -- New Zealand and the United States, Australia, Chile, Singapore, Brunei, Peru, Vietnam, and Malaysia. By eliminating most tariffs and other trade barriers, and embracing productive policies on competition, intellectual property, and government procurement, we can spur greater trade and integration not only among the participating countries, but as a spur to the entire region.\"\n\n\" Well, let me say that we discussed at some length, both the foreign minister and I and then the prime minister and I, the way forward on trade. We are very committed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and New Zealand, again, is playing a leading role. And we want to expedite the negotiations as much as possible. So we are exploring ways that we can try to drive this agenda. I am absolutely convinced that opening up markets in Asia amongst all of us and doing so in a way that creates win-win situations so that people feel that trade is in their interests.\"\n\n\"That is why the United States is very pleased by Malaysia's decision to join the negotiations for the Trans Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership. This regional trade agreement will promote shared success by expanding markets and building a level playing field for workers in every country that participates.\"\n\n\"Finally, we are pleased that Malaysia joined last month's negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That is a pact that would expand markets and create a level playing field for people in every country that does participate. I know there are tough issues to work out, as there always are with these agreements, but Malaysia's leadership in this region for greater economic growth is absolutely essential.\"\n\n\"And I think we have tremendous opportunities here. But I know when I leave tomorrow, the work to make those opportunities into realities falls to all of you. So I know a lot is expected of you, but we're going to be doing even more in Malaysia. We have a lot of plans for educational exchanges. We have some very exciting work on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, enhancing trade and investment (inaudible) that will promote closer cooperation.\"\n\n\"So in our meetings with your government officials and even in my conversation with the prime minister earlier today, we of course talked about our bilateral relationship but we also talked about the role that Malaysia is playing in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a new free trade agreement that will enhance market access, but also working to support Afghanistan and the people there with training and medical services.\"\n\n\"I n trade, our two countries have already made great progress. Fifteen years ago, our bilateral trade was about $450 million. Last year it was more than $15 billion. And the foreign minister and the prime minister and I talked about how to expand this trade relationship, including through the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The United States, Vietnam, and seven other countries finished a third round of negotiations on the TPP this month and we hope that Vietnam can conclude it in internal process and announce its status as a full member of the partnership soon.\"\n\n\"We are also pressing ahead with negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an innovative, ambitious multilateral free trade agreement that would bring together nine Pacific Rim countries, including four new free trade partners for the United States, and potentially others in the future. 2011 will be a pivotal year for this agenda. Starting with the Korea Free Trade Agreement, continuing with the negotiation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, working together for financial rebalancing at the G-20, and culminating at the APEC Leaders Summit in Hawaii, we have a historic chance to create broad, sustained, and balanced growth across the Asia Pacific and we intend to seize that.\"\n\n\"On the economic front, we've expanded our relationship with APEC, which includes four of America's top trading partners and receives 60 percent of our exports. We want to realize the benefits from greater economic integration. In order to do that, we have to be willing to play. To this end, we are working to ratify a free trade agreement with South Korea, we're pursuing a regional agreement with the nations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we know that that will help create new jobs and opportunities here at home.\"\n\n\"And I am very much supportive of Vietnam's participation as a full member in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As Vietnam embarks on labor and other reforms, the American businesses that are investing in Vietnam can provide expertise that will aid Vietnam's economic and infrastructure development.\"\n\n\"In addition, the United States is engaging in the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations as a mechanism for improving linkages among many of the major Asia-Pacific economies. And to build on political progress, we must support efforts to protect human rights and promote open societies.\"",

        "text": "Donald Trump says that he'll \"bring the jobs back\" from countries like China and Mexico. Bernie Sanders makes a similar, bold claim too.\n\nIt's possible, but it comes with a big downside: \"Consumers would definitely face higher costs,\" says Bill Watkins, an economist at California Lutheran University.\n\nLow-income Americans would take the biggest hit because they spend a high share of their income on clothes, shoes and toys -- things that rely mostly on cheap labor to make.\n\n\"It's the lower and middle class people who will face the higher costs that are associated with trade restrictions,\" says Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial.\n\nHere's how the candidates could bring jobs back to the U.S. and the risks that they run.\n\nRelated: Bernie Sanders: GE is destroying the moral fabric of America\n\n1. The Trump Tax: slap taxes on China and Mexico\n\nThe idea: Trump has said he would threaten a range of high taxes -- as much as 40% -- on imports from China and Mexico. That would make cars and clothes made overseas more expensive, and less attractive, for Americans.\n\nThe hope is that costs increase so much that it makes more sense to build them in America.\n\nRisk and costs: There's no guarantee that slapping a tax on Chinese or Mexican products would make companies bring jobs back. Experts say companies will likely move jobs to the next country with the lowest labor costs like Vietnam.\n\n\"The only way to guarantee production comes back to the U.S. is if it imposes tariffs on every other country and that's a trade war,\" says Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics.\n\nTrade wars are expensive. The United States raised tariffs in the early 1930s on European countries to protect U.S. jobs. Then Europe did the same to America. Global trade plummeted and tariffs worsened the Great Depression.\n\nRelated: GE to Sanders: We're not popular with socialists\n\n2. Make Americans more productive\n\nThe idea: Trump or Sanders could pursue policies that make American workers more productive. That is, Americans would need to produce more cars per hour or t-shirts per hour than they already do.\n\nThat would give employers more bang for their buck to justify moving jobs back to the United States.\n\nRisk and costs: Making workers more productive requires major investments in equipment, job training programs and education. Paying for those investments is costly and could mean higher taxes for Americans.\n\nIt's no quick fix -- improving worker productivity can take several years.\n\nThis strategy holds major long-term benefits for American workers, experts say, but political patience could chip away at it.\n\nRelated: Trump's economic plan: fix U.S. trade\n\n3. Bring China to the negotiating table to talk currency\n\nThe idea: Many, including Trump, have long claimed that China keeps its currency extra cheap so that its exports look more attractive to international buyers. It also makes U.S. exports more expensive for Chinese buyers.\n\nRisks and costs: Striking a currency deal with China may have unintended consequences. Let's say China let's its currency float freely like the U.S. dollar. China's currency could actually go down - that's what happened when it last loosened its grip.\n\nThat would make it even more expensive for American companies to export things to other countries. When American exports decline, American workers tend to lose their jobs. Between October and February, U.S. manufacturing was in a recession and employers slashed thousands of jobs.\n\n\"This will reduce our exports and thus cost jobs in other sectors,\" says Alan Deardorff, an economist at the University of Michigan. \"Bringing back the jobs we've 'lost' will cost us many of the jobs we've gained in other sectors.\"\n\nRelated: $75 a day vs. $75k a year: How we lost jobs to Mexico\n\n4. Pay subsidies to U.S. companies that bring jobs back\n\nThe idea: A quick fix that would compensate firms for taking on higher labor costs and bringing jobs back.\n\nRisks and costs: Paying Corporate America isn't politically popular and would likely require Americans to pay more up front.\n\n\"Taxes would be needed to pay for them,\" says Deardorff.",

How's that for a twist?\"\n\nWith a decade of stagnant wage growth as corporate profits soar to new heights, Americans are feeling the burn (and the Bern). They're taking out their anger on Big Business, the piñata of choice during the campaign season.\n\nEconomist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the America Action Forum and former campaign adviser to John McCain, said the candidates -- even President Obama -- are responding to an increasingly angry electorate.\n\n\"People are saying, 'I'm not getting a raise,'\" he said. \"Sanders is saying the system's rigged, and Trump is saying the same thing. If we were getting healthy wage increases, maybe that message wouldn't stick as well.\"\n\nObama vs. Pfizer\n\nThe Treasury Department issued new regulations last week that were designed to crack down on corporate tax avoidance. The new rules effectively smacked down Pfizer's plans for a $150 billion merger with Allergan -- a deal that Obama has been criticizing for months.\n\nObama called the kind of deal Pfizer sought \"unpatriotic,\" because it shifts a company's headquarters overseas for the sole intent of paying a lower tax bill.\n\nCompanies have argued that America's tax code is archaic and Congress should act to fix it. There's bipartisan support for tax reform, but little action so far.\n\nSanders vs. General Electric\n\nSanders told the New York Daily News that GE is \"destroying the fabric of America\" by shipping jobs to Mexico, shutting down American factories and working hard to minimize its tax bill.\n\nThat earned Sanders a sharp rebuke from General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt: \"We've never been a big hit with socialists.\"\n\nTrump vs. Ford\n\nTrump has repeatedly criticized Ford for its investments in Mexico, called Ford's latest plans to invest there \"an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nFord plans to spend $1.6 billion on a new facility that will employ 2,800 workers, and the company says it is not cutting U.S. jobs as a result.\n\nTrump said the NAFTA trade deal needs to be renegotiated.\n\nClinton vs. Oreos\n\nHillary Clinton, Trump and Sanders have all spoken out against Mondelez International's (MDLZ) plan to cut 600 jobs at a Chicago Oreo cookie factory, and move many of those positions to Mexico.\n\nIn response, Clinton last month proposed clawing back tax incentives from companies that receive U.S. tax benefits and then shift jobs overseas.\n\nCruz vs. TPP\n\nTed Cruz does not support the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a landmark trade deal that Obama struck with 12 Pacific Rim countries.\n\nRepublicans typically support such deals, and Obama got the deal done mostly with help from the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nCruz isn't alone in his dislike for the TPP: Clinton, Sanders and Trump have also all denounced the agreement.\n\nTrump vs. Bezos\n\nTrump has often criticized Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos for buying the Washington Post in order to avoid taxes and influence the government to set laws that are favorable to Amazon.\n\nThough Trump was wrong on his facts (Amazon does pay taxes), the company does benefit from the lack of an Internet sales tax in many states.\n\nIn December, Bezos responded by offering to send Trump into space on his Blue Origin rocket.\n\nObama vs. Halliburton\n\nPresident Obama's Justice Department, which has been relatively friendly to corporate mergers, sued to block the proposed merger of Halliburton and Baker Hughes.\n\nThe deal would have merged two of the three largest providers of oilfield services in the world. The Obama administration said the deal would have hurt the U.S. economy and global competition.",

        "text": "A planned free trade area spanning Europe and the U.S. is supposed to make everyone richer and create lots of jobs. So why is it proving so unpopular?\n\nThe Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP, would cover more than half of the world's economic output and 800 million people.\n\nTalks began in June 2013, and will resume in Miami on Monday. Having just struck a deal with 11 countries on a Pacific free trade zone, President Obama wants to wrap up negotiations with Europe before he leaves office.\n\nSupporters say the deal will facilitate trade between the world's two biggest economic blocs and create more than a million jobs. The European Commission says it would be worth 545 euros ($620) to each European citizen every year.\n\nYet nearly 3.5 million Europeans have already signed a petition against the deal, and hundreds of thousands marched in Berlin Sunday to voice their objections.\n\nHere's why people hate it:\n\n1. Secrecy\n\nOpponents are furious that the talks are being held in secret. The draft deal has been kept under wraps -- which in itself is not unusual for big trade agreements.\n\nBoth sides say they are being as transparent as possible, but campaigners argue that without the draft being made public, they have little chance to influence the final outcome. They're angry that some big companies are being given more of the detail, and thus have a chance to shape the deal according to their needs.\n\nWikiLeaks has offered a reward worth 100,000 euros ($114,000) for the TTIP documents.\n\n2. More power for business\n\nEuropean labor unions and pressure groups argue the deal will give too much power to big U.S. corporations.\n\nTTIP could make it easier for them to sue governments over laws they claim hurt their business. Critics say this could unleash a wave of attacks on environmental and public health protections, and allow corporations to bypass traditional judicial systems.\n\nThey're worried about secretive arbitration tribunals overruling elected governments, and cite as examples Philip Morris' (PM) suit against Australia over plain packaging laws on cigarettes, and Swedish energy company Vattenfall's action against Germany over its decision to phase out nuclear power.\n\nEurope says it doesn't want the agreement to include these powers, and is pushing for a reform of the existing international tribunal system, but it's unclear at this stage whether the U.S. will compromise on that point.\n\nRelated: Trans-Pacific trade pact is done, finally\n\n3. Public sector\n\nEuropeans love their public services like healthcare, education, and transport.\n\nThey're worried that opening these sectors to U.S. companies could lead to more privatization. The European Commission says these sectors will not be included in the agreement, but leaks from the negotiations suggest the U.S. is pushing hard for access.\n\n4. Health and safety\n\nThe deal seeks to remove trade barriers and make regulations on both sides of the Atlantic more compatible. But many in Europe are worried that could lead to a softening of Europe's existing regulations on food safety and environmental protection, which are often a lot stricter than in the U.S.\n\nActivists claim TTIP could dilute Europe's strict rules on genetically modified foods and pesticides, and reverse bans on some chemicals in cosmetics.\n\n5. Jobs could move\n\nUnions say the deal could lead to job losses in Europe, because companies might be tempted to move work to the U.S. because of more relaxed labor laws. Increased competition could also lead to job losses in some sectors.\n\nEuropean officials argue that more trade means more jobs, even if some are moved from one industry to another.",

People who lent Puerto Rico money and now expect to be paid are being portrayed as greedy vultures.\n\nBut Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt crisis isn't just a battle between New York hedge funds and a cash-strapped little island.\n\nAbout 30% of the debt is held by middle class Puerto Ricans like Teresa and Julio Garcia. Another 15% is held by other \"average Joe\" Americans who invested in bond funds.\n\n\"The government says the bonds are in the hands of vultures. That's not true,\" says Teresa, a life-long Puerto Rican. \"I'm not a vulture.\"\n\nThe Garcias are retirees. They gush about their grandchildren. And they love Puerto Rico. Teresa was born in the city of Ponce -- \"the most beautiful place,\" she claims.\n\nWhen the Garcias used their life savings to buy about $500,000 worth of Puerto Rican bonds in 2005, they thought it was a safe -- and patriotic -- investment. The bonds were AAA rated and backed by the government.\n\nWhat seemed like a win-win is now a nightmare for the Garcias. They've lost over $200,000.\n\nMany Puerto Ricans face a triple whammy of pain: their bonds are worth a lot less, their taxes are going up and their home values are plunging because of a mass population exodus from the island.\n\nIn a special investigation, CNNMoney met with numerous Puerto Rican bondholders. Their stories put a face on the crisis. The government's latest proposal to pay bondholders roughly half what they are owed would hurt hedge funds, but also regular people.\n\nRelated: There's a big sale on Puerto Rican homes\n\nJoaquin Garcia de la Noceda is 57. He's not sure he'll ever be able to retire because of the Puerto Rican bond crisis.\n\nIn 2001, he invested about $200,000 in the bonds. He says his initial investment has fallen 60%.\n\nDe la Noceda is a locksmith, not an investment expert. His financial advisor recommended buying the bonds. Now the advisor claims, \"This is something that no one anticipated.\"\n\n\"People say the rich will pay Puerto Rico's debt, but I am not rich\" says de la Noceda, who just finished paying for his daughter to attend university and is assisting his 96-year-old mother.\n\nHe and his wife run a locksmith businesses. The island's crisis is hurting that too. Companies are closing because of a prolonged recession, and the government is delaying payments that it owes businesses.\n\nDe la Noceda used to get paid within about a month of doing a job. Now it typically takes 60 to 90 days, even if he is doing work for a private company.\n\nRelated: How to build a $100 million company out of mud\n\nPeople of all ages bought the bonds. One was tech entrepreneur Carlos Melendez.\n\n\"I will never buy Puerto Rican bonds again,\" he told CNNMoney. He views his investment as \"basically a write off.\" At age 40, he's lucky he didn't invest too much in the bonds and has time to save more.\n\nMelendez is exactly the type of person Puerto Rico needs right now. He grew up on the island and has a law degree. Fluent in English and Spanish, he became a tech expert and worked in Minnesota for a big U.S. firm for awhile but moved back to the island.\n\nIn 2003, he co-founded the software company Wovenware, which now has 32 employees. Wovenware's offices are in San Juan's Santurce neighborhood -- the island's equivalent of Brooklyn. It's a hip area that's one of the few places visibly growing and improving.\n\n\"We decided to stay and make it work. Someone has to stay,\" says Melendez.\n\nRelated: Puerto Rico's brain drain crisis\n\nCarlos Alberto Ponce de Leon will turn 68 in March. He's still working -- running a small business now -- because his retirement fund has lost 60% of its value.\n\nAn engineer, de Leon worked for many years at the island's power electric utility (known as PREPA). He'll never forget going to a seminar at PREPA for people who were about to retire. He claims the folks who ran the seminar advised workers to invest in Puerto Rican bonds.\n\nThey would be \"secure\" and \"conservative.\" They came with a good interest rate and special tax exemptions. Plus the workers would be \"doing this for Puerto Rico,\" much like people who U.S. bonds during World War II.\n\nHe invested several hundred thousand dollars in 2001 and added more in the following years.\n\n\"I cannot recover 40 years of work. This represents the savings of my life,\" he told CNNMoney. Today de Leon hardly ever goes out to eat. He drives a 1986 car and his work van is from 1996.\n\nRelated: Check to see if you have the right investment mix\n\nMaria Milagros Rodriguez worked all her life to build a very successful furniture business in Puerto Rico.\n\nAround age 55, she went to UBS, one of the big banks on the island. Her financial advisor there told her to put some money into Puerto Rican bonds and some in a fixed income fund. It turns out that fund was also heavily invested in Puerto Rican bonds.\n\n\"I cry every day,\" she told CNNMoney. She has lost over $1 million. Rodriguez estimates that she has about 36% of her initial investment left. That's how much a firm recently offered her to buy her stake.\n\n\"We have worked hard and honestly. They have robbed us of what we have,\" says Maria.\n\nShe and her husband Gabriel are focused on their children and grandchildren. Her daughter has health issues, so she is trying to support her and the little ones.\n\n\"I don't spend. I give it all to my grandchildren,\" says Rodriguez.\n\nRelated: John Paulson: Why I invested billions in Puerto Rico\n\nThe Garcias have been married for almost half a century. They finish each other sentences. Both worked all their lives, Teresa as a chemist for Pfizer and Monsanto and Julio as an accountant for the government.\n\n\"All of our savings were invested with UBS in Puerto Rican bonds. We were expecting that with Social Security and our bond earnings, we would have enough money to be OK and secure,\" says Julio Garcia, age 77.\n\nThe value of their bonds has dropped in half. Fortunately, they did have other investments, but the majority of their retirement savings was in Puerto Rican debt. Today they receive about $1,000 less than what they expected each month.\n\nIt means they don't go out to movies or dinner much. They save to see their grandchildren in Arizona. Their children moved there because there weren't any jobs on the island for them.\n\n\"I have been many places -- Europe, Canada, the U.S., other islands. Still, I find Puerto Rico so beautiful. It's so sad to see Puerto Rico go down hill like this,\" says Teresa, who will soon turn 70.",

On Monday, Puerto proposed cutting that nearly in half to $26.5 billion.\n\nSo far, Puerto Rico's creditors are not impressed.\n\n\"It's frustrating, and it doesn't feel like a credible offer,\" a person close to major creditors told CNNMoney.\n\nThe crisis is likely to end up in a lengthy court battle unless Washington politicians step in. Congress is holding another hearing on Puerto Rico this week. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan promised to do something to aid the island by the end of March.\n\nPuerto Rico's governor has repeatedly said the island can't pay back all of the money it owes to creditors. Governor Alejandro García Padilla says the island is in a \"death spiral\" that is turning into a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe island is now struggling to pay teachers and is delaying payments to companies such as the vendor that supplies food to its prisons.\n\nPuerto Rico is so short of funds that it already defaulted twice, once in August and once in early January.\n\nRelated: Puerto Rico defaults for a 2nd time\n\n\"I don't think this plan is going to get very far,\" says David Tawil, president of Maglan Capital. His firm used to own Puerto Rican debt, but sold its last holdings in 2014. \"I don't see anywhere in the capital structure to make money now.\"\n\nMany Puerto Ricans are worried about the island's sagging economy. They are migrating to the mainland United States in large waves not seen since the 1950s \"West Side Story\" era.\n\nOn the creditor side, while some of the debt is owned by hedge funds, a lot is held by regular people who either bought the bonds or invested in funds such as the Franklin Double Tax-Free Income Fund (FPRIX) that own a lot of the Puerto Rican debt.\n\n\"We encourage the commonwealth to try again and to remember that a majority of the debt is held by individual investors, many of whom are seniors and retirees,\" says Matthew Kandrach, a representative of Main Street Bondholders, a coalition of Puerto Rican bondholders.\n\nRelated: Puerto Rico has a brain drain problem\n\nPuerto Rico's government argues the only way to keep paying school teachers and police and get the economy growing again is the trim the debt. At the moment, about 36% of the government's adjusted revenues go to debt payments. The island says it can't afford to pay more than 15%.\n\nThe proposal is for creditors to voluntarily exchange their current bonds for new bonds.\n\n\"A crisis of this magnitude must be addressed in concert, otherwise we risk our ability and the opportunity to escape the spiral of a stagnating economy, endless deficits and increasing debt,\" said Victor Suarez, Puerto Rico's secretary of state.\n\nPuerto Rico currently owes creditors $49.2 billion in debt backed by taxpayers. Under the island's plan, creditors would receive $26.4 billion of new bonds guaranteeing payment. Then they would get $22.7 billion of \"growth bonds\" that would only be paid if Puerto Rico has sufficient revenues to do so.\n\nOverall, the island has about $70 billion in debt, but some of that belongs to the troubled utility company or other government entities.",

The family rushed him to a local hospital in Coamo. The emergency room doctors recommended that his uncle be taken immediately to a neurologist.\n\nThen the Maldonado family was told only two neurologists were on duty for an entire island of 3.5 million people. It was a holiday weekend.\n\nRelated: Puerto Rico in Crisis\n\nHis uncle died several days later.\n\n\"Don't get hurt in Puerto Rico, especially on a holiday or a Sunday,\" says Maldonado. Occasionally, he drives by the hospital where his uncle died. There are always people waiting. The family has taken to calling the lines \"the walking dead.\"\n\nRelated: Puerto Rico has become 'dead dog island'\n\nIn 2014, 364 doctors left the island never to return, the Puerto Rican Surgeons and Physicians Association says. Last year, 500 doctors packed up. Most moved for more lucrative positions in the mainland U.S.\n\nThe island is in a financial crisis of its own -- it doesn't have enough money to pay back over $70 billion in debt. On Wednesday, the House Committee on Natural Resources is holding another hearing to determine what to do. There's been a lot of attention on whether to allow Puerto Rico to declare bankruptcy (or something like it).\n\nBut the deeper problem is that the island has been in an economic crisis for a decade. That's why doctors -- and other professionals -- are fleeing. Puerto Rico has lost over 10% of its population in the past decade. Jobs just aren't there and home values are plummeting.\n\nOn top of that, Medicare reimburses doctors far less in Puerto Rico than other states.\n\nRelated: I've lost over $200,000 on Puerto Rican bonds\n\n\"I have a hard time recruiting. We can't compete with institutions in the U.S.,\" says Dr. Fernando Luis Joglar. He's a vascular surgeon and president of the American College of Surgeons Puerto Rico Chapter.\n\nHe gets offers all the time from hospitals in the mainland United States. Many come via letter or postcard. His wife leaves them out on the kitchen table for him to see when he arrives home.\n\nShe doesn't even have to say it out loud, why are they still in Puerto Rico?\n\nFor Dr. Joglar, it's because his family is there and he worries what will happen if he leaves. His specialty is a lot like neurology. There are only a handful of vascular surgeons left who operate on veins and arteries. If he goes, he believes corpses will pile up.\n\n\"The recession is getting worse. It's effecting private hospitals. They're closing,\" says Dr. Joglar.\n\nRelated: Puerto Rico might CUT its minimum wage\n\nCongress has promised to take some sort of action to aid the island in its time of crisis, likely before a huge debt payment is due to creditors in July. There's a push to give Puerto Rico more federal Medicare and Medicaid funding in the final bill. But the initial \"discussion draft\" legislation didn't include any additional health care money.\n\nGovernor Alejandro García Padilla has gone as far as to declare a \"humanitarian crisis\" on the island. His office notes that Puerto Rico \"receives less than half the federal healthcare funding of any of the 50 states.\" The Zika virus outbreak has only stressed the island's medical system further.\n\n\"If they don't stop the bleeding now, this is going to get super ugly by the end of the year,\" says Maldonado. He's trying to convince his 80-year-old mother to move back to New York City with him.",

        "text": "Looking for a real estate steal? Try Puerto Rico.\n\nWhile most of the U.S. freezes in February, Puerto Rico is 80 degrees. The island is home to one of the world's best beaches, according to TripAdvisor.\n\nAnd it's a buyer's market right now. You can get a 3-bedroom home near the beach for under $100,000.\n\nHedge fund billionaire John Paulson has been scooping up real estate there. He predicts it will be the \"next Miami.\"\n\nSo what's the catch? For sale signs are everywhere in Puerto Rico. People are fleeing the island because it's been in a prolonged economic crisis. The situation is reminiscent of what Detroit was like when it filed for bankruptcy in 2013.\n\n\"So many houses are empty here,\" says Joaquin Garcia de la Noceda, a locksmith in San Juan, the island's capital.\n\nRelated: John Paulson: Why I invested billions in Puerto Rico\n\nJoaquin listed his 96-year-old mother's home in San Juan for $100,000. Hardly anyone looks at it even though it's in San Juan and has three bedrooms and two bathrooms.\n\nThe home is one of many bargains in Puerto Rico. It was appraised at $215,000 not long ago, and his mom paid $177,000 for it in 2009.\n\nFew want to buy with the island in crisis mode. More than 1 in 10 people can't find jobs and the government is deep in debt. Since Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, many are simply packing up and moving to Florida, Texas and other states.\n\nThe island has lost over 10% of its population -- roughly 440,000 people -- in the past decade. The exodus appears to be accelerating since the island defaulted for the first time ever in August.\n\n\"People are literally leaving their homes empty with the keys in the house,\" says retiree Maria Milagros Rodriquez. They let the bank deal with it.\n\nRelated: I've lost over $200,000 on Puerto Rican bonds\n\nPuerto Rico's foreclosure crisis\n\nMaria owns a gated home in San Juan with 5 bedrooms, a pool and a big garage. Homes on her block sold for over $1 million only a few years ago. Now people are lucky to get $400,000.\n\nIf Puerto Rico were a state, it would currently rank second in the U.S. for homes in foreclosure, according to RealtyTrac. It only lags behind New Jersey.\n\nThe plight is evident on Maria's block. The home next to hers is empty and she knows of two other vacant properties a few houses down. There are no \"for sale\" signs yet because most of the homes are in the process of being repossessed by their banks.\n\nPuerto Rico has more foreclosures now than the national average at the peak of the housing crisis in 2010, says Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac.\n\nAnd it's only likely to get worse. More and more homes are entering the foreclosure process. It's another blow as the the island tries to deal with its recession and $70 billion in debt.\n\nRelated: Puerto Rico wants to erase half its debt\n\nBargain buyers are starting to come\n\nThe \"beachfront bargains\" are starting to attract buyers.\n\nPaulson isn't the only one looking for deals. Wealthy investor Nicholas Prouty bought an apartment building out of bankruptcy in 2012. People warned him it would take a decade to sell the condos. He's already sold all 312 apartments.\n\nWho's buying them? He told CNNMoney the typical purchaser is a single Puerto Rican woman in her early 30s with a graduate degree.\n\nThey pay $160,000 for a one-bedroom and $230,000 for a 3-bedroom. The apartment building -- known as Ciudadela -- is located in the heart of San Juan and has its own security force and private trash collection.\n\nThe project has been so successful that Prouty is working on two more buildings.\n\n\"The prices are excellent on real estate here,\" says Prouty, who has even re-located his own family from Greenwich, Connecticut to Puerto Rico.",

        "text": "Leopoldina Roubian feels like her phone rings as often as a 911 emergency call center.\n\nShe and her friends rescued over 1,100 abandoned animals in Puerto Rico last year, mostly dogs.\n\nPeople leave animals in boxes on her doorstep. They call her when they see stray dogs, who are all over -- on beaches, in parks and by the roadside. And then there are the puppies left to die in vacant houses or dumpsters.\n\n\"This last year has been horrible,\" says Roubian, known to most as \"Leo\" or just \"dog lady.\"\n\nMany animal lovers have heard of Puerto Rico's \"dead dog beach,\" a stretch of sand and jungle on the island's southeastern side where people dump their dogs. But the truth is Puerto Rico has become \"dead dog island,\" Roubian says.\n\nRelated: I've lost over $200,000 on Puerto Rican bonds\n\nThe financial crisis has made it worse\n\nThe problem is getting worse as Puerto Rico's economic crisis deepens. Roubian never leaves home without pet food because she finds strays daily. Her property has become a makeshift shelter. She lives with over 20 dogs and sometimes pigs, cats and horses too.\n\nNo one knows exactly how many strays Puerto Rico has, but a 2010 documentary about the plight is called \"100,000\" for a reason.\n\n\"If people care, they dump the dog in areas like Rincon [a popular surfing town] where people and tourists are around,\" says Roubian. But many don't care -- or don't have the money to care. They leave dogs by the road or in the trash.\n\nPeople who flee the island...leave their dogs\n\nPeople are literally fleeing Puerto Rico because the island's economy is so bad. One in 10 people is out of work. The island's government has run out of money and is $72 billion in debt.\n\nOver 10% of the population has booked a one-way ticket out (mostly to Florida, Texas and elsewhere in the mainland U.S.) in the past decade. Sometimes people just leave their homes and lock their dogs inside, never to return.\n\nRelated: Sato Project saves pups from 'Dead Dog Beach'\n\nVolunteers say the island's no-kill shelters are full and that animals taken to many facilities are put down. That's why nonprofits such as Barks of Hope (which Roubian spearheads) and her partners ARF (Animal Rescue Foundation) and Defensa Animal de Rincón try so hard to rescue animals first.\n\nRelated: There's a big sale on Puerto Rican homes\n\nMachismo culture makes the dog problem worse\n\nRoubian is a fairy godmother to Puerto Rican animals. But she has tough love for humans who don't care for their pets.\n\n\"Your dog is beautiful. Why does it have balls?\" she frequently asks people on the streets.\n\nPart of the reason the dog crisis is so bad is that Puerto Ricans don't spay or neuter their dogs. It's a machismo thing. Puerto Rican men don't want to cut off a dog's manhood. The trouble is when dogs get abandoned on the streets, they breed and breed and breed.\n\n\"Puerto Rico has so many problems,\" laments Ivette Cruzado, an engineer and professor who spends her spare time volunteering with ARF in the surf city of Rincon. \"This is a stubborn culture.\"\n\nNot enough veterinarians in Puerto Rico\n\nThe government is also at fault, volunteers say.\n\nVeterinarians are willing to come help -- for free. They offer to treat and neuter strays, but technically, they are forbidden from operating under Puerto Rican law.\n\nThe vets would need a license issued by a Puerto Rican board. The process is cumbersome and there are no longer any veterinary schools on the island.\n\n\"Maybe they think it would take business away from Puerto Rican doctors, but these animals aren't going to any vets at all,\" says Denise Gilbert, who moved to Rincon, Puerto Rico with her family several years ago. She has adopted 12 dogs and 15 cats.\n\nA simple stroke of a pen by the Puerto Rican government to accept veterinary licenses from other U.S. states or grant temporary permits to visiting doctors could make a big difference, Gilbert says.\n\nFormer governors -- both liberal and conservative -- told CNNMoney they were aware of the problem but it fell to the bottom of the \"to do\" list. The current government has made some efforts to partner with the Humane Society, but the problem is vast.\n\nRelated: Who is behind one of the biggest scams in history?\n\nDogs fly from Puerto Rico to New York\n\nAs word has spread about Puerto Rico's stray dogs -- including many pure bred Shih Tzu and Maltese -- people in New York, New Jersey and elsewhere have started to step up and adopt the animals. Or just get the animals to no-kill shelters.\n\nVolunteers like Roubian and Gilbert often wake up at 3 a.m. to drive dogs to the San Juan airport on the other side of the island so they can board morning flights to New York.\n\nAmerican Airlines (AAL) flies dogs under 50 pounds to New York and other locations for about $50 to $80, a dramatically reduced rate.\n\nMany American Airlines workers have embraced the cause. They clean the kennels the dogs are transported in and return them to the Puerto Rican volunteers so they can be used again.\n\nVolunteers wish other airlines like United (UAL) and JetBlue (JBLU) that fly those routes would offer discounts as well. United and JetBlue didn't respond to CNNMoney's request for comment for this article.\n\nRelated: Why I put billions in Puerto Rico\n\nHow to resolve the crisis\n\nCNNMoney spoke with numerous volunteers in Puerto Rico who rescue animals. All of them had a similar wishlist, primarily made up of three things:\n\n\n\nMore families willing to adopt the animals A requirement for Puerto Ricans to neuter their dogs The Puerto Rican government to lift its restriction on veterinary licenses\n\nRoubian's average veterinary bill is around $5,000 a month. She never turns away animals, but she dreams of the day when this crisis ends and she gets happy phone calls again.\n\n\"I don't know what it is about Puerto Rican dogs, but they are the best,\" Roubian says as her latest adopted pup, a Chihuahua, licks her face.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting a Puerto Rican dog or supporting the rescue efforts, you can learn more about Barks of Hope here, Defensa Animal here or Animal Rescue Foundation here. These three groups partner together.",

The island owes about $1 billion to creditors on January 4.\n\nGovernor Alejandro García Padilla said Wednesday that the island will make all payments except for $37.3 million. He claims the debts that will go unpaid were never guaranteed by Puerto Rico and the creditors should know this.\n\nIt will be the second default in the island's history. The first default occurred in early August.\n\nPuerto Rico is trying to figure out how to deal with about $73 billion in debt. Governor Padilla has called it a \"death spiral\" for the island. The economy is in recession and people are migrating to the mainland U.S. at a rate not seen since the 1950s \"West Side Story\" era.\n\n\"We're out of cash,\" Governor Padilla recently told CNN.\n\nPuerto Rico blames Congress\n\nThe governor blames Congress for failing to act in time to aid Puerto Rico. He wants the ability to renegotiate with creditors in an \"ordered process.\"\n\nHe believes Puerto Rico should have the same Chapter 9 bankruptcy rights that all 50 states have. It could help force creditors to the bargaining table similar to what happened in Detroit's bankruptcy.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has said he plans to take action to help Puerto Rico sometime in the first quarter of 2016, but that was too late to prevent the default now.\n\n\"No amount of lobbying can change the math or the facts -- there isn't enough money to provide essential services to the people of Puerto Rico, repay our existing obligations and grow our economy, which is the only way the Commonwealth will ever be able repay our creditors,\" said Melba Acosta Febo, head of Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThere was concern that the default would be much larger, but Puerto Rico was able to make all of its general obligation bond payments, the debt that has the most legal protections and is held by many mutual funds and even some Puerto Rican residents.\n\nWhat's next for Puerto Rico?\n\nThe Obama administration supports giving Puerto Rico Chapter 9 bankruptcy rights, but it is up to Congress to act. A Treasury Department spokesman called the island's situation a \"dead end\" with Puerto Rico now resorting to \"shifting funds from one creditor to pay another.\"\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Puerto Rico warned that there isn't a lot more the island can do to find money to pay its debts in 2016. Unless bondholders negotiate new terms, Puerto Rico said it will not be about to avoid default \"even on our public debt.\"\n\nThe next payment of about $200 million is due in February. Puerto Rican officials say that payment will be made.\n\nAfter that, the major hurdle is a May 1 payment.\n\nRelated: Puerto Rico's brain drain: Fewer children in schools\n\nRelated: Why Walmart is suing Puerto Rico\n\nCNNMoney's Patrick Gillespie contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Gold's glittering year keeps getting brighter.\n\nThe precious metal hit a new milestone on Monday, climbing above $1,300 an ounce for the first time since January 2015. Gold is now up 22% this year, crushing stocks, bonds and most other major asset classes.\n\nThe recent gold strength shows how the 2016 rally has really been fueled by two distinct stages. The first was a flight to safety as turmoil erupted on Wall Street and around the world, highlighted by the U.S. stock market's worst start to a year ever.\n\nGold prices calmed down a bit as U.S. stocks staged a massive comeback and turned positive on the year. But gold is once again on the rise, lifting the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD) nearly 6% over the past month. The S&P 500 is virtually unchanged since then.\n\nSo what's fueling this latest rally? This time it's the U.S. dollar. A weak dollar is good for gold because it makes the metal less expensive for foreign buyers and reinforces gold's role as a good store of long-term value.\n\nRelated: Mining stocks soar...can it last?\n\nThe U.S. dollar has plunged 2% against a basket of currencies over the past week. That decline has helped lift gold more than 4% over that span. After years of strength, the greenback has lately been dented by the Federal Reserve scaling back its once-ambitious plans to raise rates and near-zero economic growth in the U.S.\n\n\"We had gone through such extremes of dollar strength. It was just time for the dollar to come back,\" said Axel Merk, founder of Merk Investments.\n\nThe dollar took a big hit against the Japanese yen just last week after the Bank of Japan shocked investors by declining to launch new stimulus efforts.\n\nGold has also been helped by a bit of renewed turbulence in the stock market. Last week the Dow suffered its worst week since February and the Nasdaq is in the midst of a seven-day losing streak.\n\nTodd Salamone, senior vice president of research at Schaeffer's Investment Research, said in a recent blog post that \"now might be the time\" to sell gains in the stock market and increase exposure to gold. He cited the \"potential for sideways action\" in stocks over the next several weeks.\n\nNo matter the cause, the gold rally has been huge for gold mining stocks like Newmont Mining (NEM). Shares of Newmont have spiked 90% this year.\n\nRelated: Silver is even hotter than gold these days\n\nBut is it too late to get into gold given the recent spike?\n\nEven the gold bulls at Capital Economics concede they are \"a bit wary of the strength of the current\" commodity rally and warn that a pullback could be coming. They point to the possibility the Fed will resume its rate hike plans and the U.S. dollar strengthens.\n\nHowever, Capital Economics still thinks gold can end the year around $1,350 an ounce before rising to $1,400 by the end of 2017.\n\nMerk is also staying bullish on gold, in part because he believes the U.S. stock market is in the midst of a bear market rally.\n\n\"If I'm correct and we do have the S&P 500 plunge down, gold could do very, very well,\" he said. \"If policymakers do everything perfect and equity markets end happily ever after, we could have seen the highs in gold.\"",

        "text": "Remember the massive plunge in commodity prices last year? For some investors in China, it already appears to be a distant memory.\n\nSteel and iron ore prices have buoyed in recent weeks. Other commodities -- including cotton and even eggs -- are also reported to have seen startling surges on Chinese futures exchanges. The moves have prompted some experts to worry that a new bubble is forming.\n\nHigher iron ore prices, for example, have \"triggered speculative trading in iron ore futures in China,\" said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific Chief Economist at IHS Insight. But the rally \"may falter due to continued excess supply in world iron ore markets,\" he warned.\n\nThe situation is making Beijing a little worried. China's top securities regulator last week ordered commodities futures exchanges to bring speculative trading under control, although the statement posted on its website didn't provide details on how.\n\nRelated: China plans to cut 1.8 million coal and steel jobs\n\nIt's no surprise officials are concerned, given China's long history with asset bubbles. As China's property market was on the wane a few years ago, people started piling into stocks, fueling last year's meteoric rise and spectacular crash that sent shock waves around the globe. Lately, investors have gone back to real estate, and now, commodities.\n\nSome of the recent boost for raw material prices has been backed by real demand, said Biswas, pointing to a flurry of demand as housing construction ramps up again in China and the government steps in to support infrastructure spending. But a glut of supply for both iron ore and steel continues to put a drag on the price increases.\n\nBeijing's recent efforts to prop up growth by pumping more money into the economy may be having unwanted side effects, some experts say.\n\n\"Growing regulatory concerns over speculation in commodities are another example of how throwing more credit at China's economy creates more problems than it solves,\" said Andrew Colquhoun of Fitch Ratings. \"Risky and speculative activity intensifies when credit growth is strong, as it currently is.\"\n\nChina rose quickly in recent decades to become the world's second-largest economy, consuming lots of raw materials to build roads, bridges, factories and skyscrapers.\n\nBut as the country grew at its slowest pace in a quarter century last year, construction faltered and demand waned for copper, steel and other materials. Commodities markets, and the countries that depend on them, took a huge hit.\n\nRelated: Cheap Chinese steel claims another victim\n\nExcess supply in industries like steel has hurt companies around the globe. Beijing has been accused of dumping its unwanted metal on other markets.\n\nIn March, Tata Steel said it was forced to explore a sale of its entire U.K. operations because of plummeting prices.\n\nEarlier this year, things got so bad that the Chinese government announced that it would ax 1.8 million coal and steel jobs and cut production in efforts to tackle overcapacity. Economists applauded the effort then as a painful move in the right direction, since much of China's commodities sector is made up of notoriously inefficient state-owned enterprises.\n\nBut the recent rise in steel prices and the Chinese government's stimulus efforts may mean priorities are more likely to shift away from cutting overcapacity, Macquarie's China economist Larry Hu wrote in a research note.",

        "text": "It was less than four months ago that China was sneezing and the rest of the world was catching a cold.\n\nTurmoil in Chinese equities and currency markets in early January spooked investors worldwide. The fear was that policymakers in Beijing were losing control of a slowdown in China's giant economy, bringing risks to the rest of the globe.\n\nFast forward to the first-quarter GDP data released Friday, and the news was met with barely a ripple of reaction in the markets. The numbers confirmed that China's economy has not fallen off a cliff. In fact, it's stabilizing.\n\nThat's the good news. The bad news is that all the tools that China is using now to underpin economic growth are from a playbook that's all too familiar.\n\n\"This looks like an old-style, credit-backed, investment-driven recovery,\" SG Global Economics said in a research note. It noted that the current situation \"bears an uncanny resemblance\" to the beginning of China's debt-driven stimulus package during the depths of the global financial crisis.\n\nIn other words, one step forward two steps back.\n\nRelated: China posts slowest quarterly growth in 7 years\n\nBeijing has clearly avoided the economic hard landing that investors were worrying about in January. But rather than address its economy's deep-rooted issues through reforms and restructuring, it's reverted to its old approach of throwing money at the problem.\n\nTake a look at the numbers. In the first quarter, infrastructure spending boomed and credit growth soared.\n\nIn March alone, Chinese financial institutions made loans totaling $211 billion, twice as much as the previous month and well ahead of expectations.\n\nThat all adds up to a big financial shot in the arm for the economy, with echoes of China's $600 billion spending spree in 2009 to protect the economy from the downdrafts of the financial crisis emanating from the U.S.\n\nThe 2009 effort worked, but not for the long term. The stimulus package left big asset bubbles created by easy money and speculation.\n\nThe same could be happening again. Property prices are soaring in major Chinese cities once again. According to property services group Cushman and Wakefield, prices in Shanghai are up a whopping 24% in just the first two months of the year.\n\nBad loans are piling up at the big state-controlled banks, and officials are warning about high levels of corporate debt.\n\nRelated: Bad loans on the rise at China's biggest banks\n\nFor how long will Beijing's new round of efforts succeed in propping up the economy?\n\nIn a note to clients, Goldman Sachs says it doubts the \"sustainability of the acceleration beyond the next few months\". According to Goldman, there is a \"high likelihood\" that Chinese economic growth will hit the lower end of the government's 6.5%-7% target range this year.\n\nSG Global Economics also says the current recovery \"will not last very long\".\n\nWhat's missing in Beijing's response to the slowing economy is the commitment to economic reforms that will have a long-term effect of rebalancing the economy.\n\nThat means moves like killing off the zombie state-owned enterprises that are kept alive by government handouts while turning out products that nobody wants.\n\nThis type of restructuring is painful and will cost millions of jobs if it's done properly.\n\nBut at this stage it appears Beijing does not have the political will to carry them through, preferring instead the old-style pump-priming that provides short-term relief but is not sustainable.",

The S&P 500 has more than tripled since early 2009 and despite a recent pullback is sitting near all-time highs.\n\nTrump isn't the only one worried\n\nCarl Icahn, the billionaire Trump wants to hire as his Treasury secretary, warned of a looming \"catastrophe\" last month in a video dubbed \"Danger Ahead.\" Icahn called into question high valuations in the stock market driven by \"financial engineering\" and \"suspect\" earnings.\n\nRobert Shiller, a market scholar at Yale University, recently told the Financial Times that investors are more fearful about valuation than at any time since the dotcom bubble in 2000. \"It looks to me a bit like a bubble again,\" Shiller said.\n\nRelated: CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index flashing 'Fear'\n\nIt's important to remember bubbles are notoriously difficult to time. During the late 1990s dotcom bubble, or the early 2000s real estate bubble, valuations raced higher for years before eventually popping.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump scares Wall Street\n\nBull market built on real growth\n\nSo far these bubble doomsayers appear to be in the minority. While many acknowledge the U.S. stock market is expensive, none of the market strategists CNNMoney polled believe there's a bubble brewing.\n\n\"We are a long way from bubble territory. I don't think it's right to say the broader U.S. equity market is in a bubble,\" said Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at BlackRock.\n\nThey point to the real momentum the U.S. economy has gathered since 2009. While the economy isn't going gangbusters, six years ago there were legitimate fears of a depression. Today the U.S. is adding millions of jobs a year and corporate profits are near all-time highs.\n\n\"The broad U.S. economy is actually in decent shape. The notion all of this was built on cheap money is not right,\" Koesterich said.\n\nTerry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, believes that \"classic signs of market froth are not evident.\"\n\nThe market strategists CNNMoney polled pointed to the following metrics as signs that while stocks are pricey, they're not in bubble territory -- yet.\n\nRelated: 16 stocks to buy no matter what the economy does\n\n1. People aren't euphoric about stocks\n\nExcessive enthusiasm about stocks is never a good sign. Yet this contrarian signal is not even flashing yellow right now.\n\nIn fact, just 25% of financial advisors polled by Investors Intelligence in late September were bullish on stocks. That was the lowest level since March 2009. While that figure has since climbed, it's well below the 2015 peak.\n\nIn fact CNN's Fear and Greed Index, which tracks seven indicators of investor sentiment, is flashing \"fear\" currently. The index has recovered from \"extreme fear,\" but it's not in the \"greed\" territory yet.\n\nRelated: Doom and gloom is all the rage on Wall Street\n\n2. Multiples aren't ridiculous\n\nStocks are not cheap, but valuations aren't outrageous either. The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio is currently 15.8, according to FactSet Research. The firm says that's down from 17.2 in late February and well below the dotcom peak of nearly 27 in late 1999. P/E ratios are a reflection of stock prices compared with future profits.\n\n\"While the U.S. stock market is fully valued...we do not believe it is in a classical bubble,\" said Kristina Hooper, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors.\n\n3. People aren't flocking to stocks\n\nDuring bubbles, everyone from your dentist to your mailman is racing to toss money in the market. That's hardly the case today.\n\nInvestors have actually yanked $113 billion from U.S. equities so far this year, according to a CNNMoney analysis of fund flow data from the Investment Company Institute.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump's best stock picks\n\n4. No IPO boom\n\nStock market bubbles are typically associated with a rush to bring companies public. But the IPO market has actually been pretty lackluster this year.\n\nRoughly $30 billion was raised in the IPO market through the end of last week, down from nearly $81 billion at the same point of last year, according to Ipreo Capital Markets.\n\nRelated: Biggest IPO of the year is a dud\n\n5. Biotech, social media bubbles?\n\nOf course, none of this means a bubble isn't brewing under the surface. And even market bulls acknowledge certain corners of the financial markets look inflated.\n\n\"There are parts of the market like private equity, social media and biotech that are looking very frothy,\" said BlackRock's Koesterich.",

        "text": "He's a young, talented man chasing the American dream: a car, a house and one day a family of his own. And he just landed a dream job as an engineer at General Electric with good pay.\n\nExcept this engineer isn't in America. He's in Mexico.\n\nCarlos is a college-educated, manufacturing engineer who makes $1,500 a month working the production line at a GE plant in Mexico.\n\nHe loves GE and sees a future there. His salary works out to about $75 a day.\n\n\"I really like my job,\" Carlos told CNNMoney. \"I have to keep working harder and save money so I can get to a better position.\" (Carlos is not his real name. To protect his job, CNNMoney chose to withhold his name.)\n\nCarlos' aspirations and drive could mirror those of any 24-year old American with similar skills. But his job is in Mexico, where GE has 17 manufacturing plants and 10,000 employees.\n\nRelated: America has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000\n\nA typical manufacturing engineer that works for GE in the United States makes nearly $75,000 a year, according to an analysis of salaries compiled by Glassdoor.\n\nThat works out to about $312 a day ... or four times more than Carlos' salary.\n\nThat wage gap can easily explain why so many manufacturing jobs have left the United States. Since 2000, the U.S. has lost about 5 million manufacturing jobs.\n\nIt's become a hot button topic on the 2016 campaign trail where Donald Trump promises angry Americans that he'll \"bring the jobs back from Mexico.\"\n\nCarlos disagrees.\n\n\"I actually don't think that Donald Trump can steal the jobs from here and take them to the U.S.,\" says Carlos, a huge soccer fan and avid ESPN watcher. \"A lot of facilities in the U.S. are coming to Mexico because labor here is cheaper.\"\n\nRelated: Is trade really killing middle class jobs?\n\nExperts agree with Carlos: Manufacturing has crossed the Rubicon -- or Rio Grande -- and it's hard to see those jobs returning to the U.S.\n\n\"This promise that we can reverse everything with the snap of a finger is a false siren,\" says economist Charles Ballard of Michigan State University.\n\nOne expert, Robert Scott at the Economic Policy Institute, estimates that the U.S. lost roughly 800,000 jobs to Mexico between 1997 and 2013. He cites NAFTA -- the North American Free Trade Agreement signed in 1993 -- as the key driver for job losses.\n\nBefore NAFTA, Mexico's government had restrictions on foreign companies and who they could hire. NAFTA nullified those rules and America's trade deficit with Mexico has ballooned -- meaning we're bringing in a lot more goods from Mexico than we're sending there. That's good for American consumers but bad for manufacturing workers.\n\nRelated: I sent my resume to Donald Trump\n\n\"The agreement is a failure,\" says Scott. \"We sign trade deals that encourage manufacturing firms to outsource jobs to other countries.\"\n\nCheaper labor, lower environmental standards and low export taxes -- or tariffs -- make Mexico an attractive place to move operations, not to mention that it's next door to America. Add on NAFTA -- the success of which is debatable -- and you can see why so many U.S. companies crossed the border. Almost every large U.S. manufacturer, from Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) to Procter & Gamble (PG) and Caterpillar (CAT) has production facilities in Mexico.\n\nGE (GE) declined to comment on salaries of employees in Mexico or the U.S., but a spokesperson said salaries vary by country, skill level and other benchmarks. GE says it has had some operations in Mexico going back to 1896.\n\nRelated: Americans fear 'dead end crap jobs'\n\nCarlos is actually doing much better than the typical worker in Mexico.\n\nManufacturing workers in Mexico earn an average wage of about $13 a day, according to CNNMoney's analysis of Mexican government statistics. The typical assembly line worker in the U.S. makes $25 per HOUR, Labor Department data shows.\n\nTrump's solution to bringing jobs back from Mexico is to raise taxes -- or tariffs -- by 35% on things that come from Mexico, making them more expensive for American buyers.\n\n\"It would be a disaster,\" says Alan Deardorff, an economist at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. \"We'd lose a tremendous amount of other jobs.\"\n\nTrump's tariff plan isn't original. The U.S. increased tariffs on foreign countries in 1930. It didn't work out so well. Other countries raised tariffs on America in retaliation, starting a trade war. The tariff hike was one of the causes of the Great Depression.\n\nHow can America create more manufacturing jobs? Invest in Mexico, experts argue. If the United States could help raise wages in Mexico, that would increase the country's middle class and then Mexicans could afford more pricey, American-made products.\n\n\"We would have to make major investments in Mexico,\" says Scott. \"There are going to be jobs that move to Mexico ... [but] it's conceivable that we could export other things to Mexico if they had more wealth.\"\n\nAfter all, when Carlos earns enough money, guess where he likes to go shopping? Texas.",

        "text": "America's economy is not in a recession, but fears of one are growing fast.\n\nThe chance of the U.S. sinking into a full-blown recession now stand at 18%, according to a CNNMoney survey of economists this week.\n\nThat's nearly double what the nation's top economic policymaker predicted only a month ago.\n\nFederal Reserve chair Janet Yellen put the probability of a recession in 2016 at about 10% during her December press conference after the Fed raised interest rates for the first time in years.\n\nShe has said repeatedly that she thinks a recession is not on the horizon. The U.S. has enjoyed two years of incredibly strong job growth -- the best since 1999 -- and the economy is expanding at a healthy pace of around 2% a year.\n\n\"There are plenty of things to worry about in the world, but the health and ongoing strength of the U.S. economy is not one of them,\" says James Smith of EconForecaster.com.\n\nRelated: Stocks: How scared should we be?\n\nBut the risks are rising, and the pessimists are getting bolder in their predictions.\n\nThe stock market is off to its worst start ever to a year. China's stock market is tanking again, pulling much of Europe and Asia into bear market territory. While it's clear that China's economy is slowing down, no one is certain just how bad it is. Chinese data is questionable, and the country's head statistician is now under investigation for possible corruption.\n\nWhile the U.S. remains healthy for now, to paraphrase John Donne, \"no economy is an island\" anymore. There's a spillover effect.\n\nAmerican stocks plunged into correction (a 10% drop) this month as investors don't see how U.S. companies can continue to grow a lot when China and so many emerging markets are having issues.\n\nCitigroup predicted a 65% chance of a U.S. recession, a call that was so eyebrow raising that Yellen herself felt the need to swat it away, calling it \"absolutely\" wrong.\n\nThe stock market almost never leads the economy into a recession. It's usually the other way around.\n\n\"The equity market has completely divorced itself from U.S. economic fundamentals,\" says Bernard Baumohl, chief economist at The Economic Outlook Group. \"Low interest rates, cheap oil prices, and the lowest input costs ever for business are not -- and never will be -- the precursors of recession.\"\n\nRelated: Why you should worry about cheap oil\n\nNearly all the experts say the key is the American consumer. As long as people keep spending, the U.S. -- and the world -- should pull through.\n\nBut there are warning signs even beyond the stock market.\n\n\"The manufacturing sector is already in recession,\" says Brett Ryan, chief economist at Deutsche Bank. Ryan and many economists told CNNMoney they are watching claims for unemployment benefits closely as an indicator that the strain is moving beyond manufacturing and into other parts of the economy.\n\nBeyond jobs, Ryan is also watching car sales, tax receipts and loans (specifically the Fed's senior loan officer survey). So far, everything other than manufacturing still looks solid.\n\nRelated: Relax. We are not heading for a global meltdown\n\nThe Fed's modest interest rate hike was supposed to be a vote of confidence that the U.S. economy had finally put the Great Recession behind it and was back on solid footing. But now Washington, Wall Street and Main Street question if that optimism is far too rosy.\n\nThe Fed predicts four more rate hikes in 2016. Investors now think that's far-fetched and will be watching the central bank's statement closely on Wednesday for signs the Fed is \"on hold\" again.\n\n\"It's no leap to say the four rate hikes envisioned by the Fed this year seem increasingly implausible,\" wrote Morgan Stanley in a recent report. \"Stall speed in the U.S., or even a shift to a lower channel of growth, would likely halt the Fed in its tracks.\"",

Enough of the American people have got it through their heads that the American Dream is dead for us,\" says Jo-Ann, who lives in Pennsylvania. She requested that her last name be withheld for this article so it wouldn't impact her ongoing search for a better job.\n\nThe economy is the No. 1 issue on voters' minds even though America is growing, unemployment is incredibly low (4.9%) and gas is cheap.\n\n\"I thank God I don't have a kid. I don't know what I would tell them,\" she says. Her advice to young people is to skip college and learn a trade like plumbing that probably won't be shipped overseas. She supports Sanders. She agrees with him (and Trump) that trade deals like NAFTA are part of the problem.\n\nRelated: Rich men's paychecks are getting fatter while poor are paid less\n\nGreat Recession fears linger\n\nAmericans are on edge. Many CNN readers responded to a recent survey about their economic worries. Over and over, people said they were fearful of losing a job, of a health problem that would drain their savings, of wages that aren't growing and of diminished prospects for their children.\n\nBillionaire investor Warren Buffett argues people are way too pessimistic about the economy. He says babies born in America today are \"the luckiest crop in history.\"\n\nBut Americans fear life could derail quickly, much as it did for many during the Great Recession.\n\n\"The job market is tough. People are scared. They aren't leaving their jobs,\" says Ashley Brinkman, 28, of Anchorage, Alaska. She and her husband have jobs they enjoy, but they look around and see mass layoffs in Alaska's energy sector and cuts to education.\n\n\"We are living the middle class dream. We vacation once a year and own a camper,\" says Brinkman, who recently received an $11,000 raise as she moved up the ranks from being a bank teller to a management job. But life hinges on staying employed.\n\nBrinkman grew up in a small South Dakota town. She says people there describe this presidential race as akin to \"picking the cleanest turd out of the bunch.\"\n\nShare your story with CNN: Are YOU worried about the economy?\n\nAmericans worry for their kids\n\nPeople are especially concerned about the future for their children.\n\nIn a CNNMoney/E*Trade survey this year, 56% of people said they think their kids will be worse off financially than they are.\n\nRicardo Bustamente has worked for years as a technician at Verizon. He's often told \"do more with less.\" He's learned that means more work for him as others get laid off, but no extra pay.\n\n\"My biggest fear is that this country is going to become a nation of have and have nots. People at my level are slowing dying out,\" says Bustamente, who is about to turn 43 and has three kids.\n\nHe hasn't gotten a raise in almost 8 years, but his expenses keep going up. He drives a 10-year old car and his wife diligently clips coupons and buys items on sale.\n\n\"I'm literally making less money every year,\" he says. If he loses his job, his family might lose their house.\n\nRelated: 'Gordon Gekko' wants Bernie Sanders to be president\n\nBustamente likes a lot of what Sanders is saying, especially on making college and health care more affordable, but he doesn't think Congress would ever enact Sanders' policies. Still, he is glad Sanders entered the race and has influenced Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"Slowly but surely I see myself and others around me eroding. We're definitely not moving up. We're moving backward,\" he says.",

        "text": "Mitt Romney threw the ultimate insult on Donald Trump: He's a \"phony\" who will sink the U.S. economy.\n\n\"His domestic policies would lead to recession. His foreign policies would make America and the world less safe. He has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president,\" Romney said in a highly critical speech of Trump on Thursday.\n\nRomney is the latest in a deluge of high profile American leaders warning that Trump doesn't have a clue how to lead the economy, let alone the country.\n\nTrump \"has a kindergarten view of economics,\" billionaire investor Stan Druckenmiller said Wednesday on CNBC. \"The stuff that comes out his mouth just astonishes me.\"\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman called Trump \"unfit\" to be president. Whitman, a Republican who lost in her bid to become governor of California in 2010, is reportedly part of a group of business leaders raising money to block Trump.\n\nRelated: Why Hillary Clinton could beat Donald Trump\n\nTrump and his team have fired back claiming this is just another example of the out-of-touch GOP establishment.\n\nBeyond the insults, could Trump's plans for the country send the U.S. into a recession?\n\nMany experts say yes. That is, if he follows through on his campaign rhetoric. Here's the rundown on his economic policy flaws:\n\n1. Starting a trade war with China and Mexico\n\nThe biggest fear in business circles is that Trump would start a trade war with China (among other countries). He threatens to slap tariffs -- aka fees -- of up to 45% on Chinese and Mexican products. Those countries aren't going to send a thank you card back. They're likely to respond by hiking fees on U.S. products coming into their countries.\n\n\"One of [Trump's] themes is we're going to give it to China, et al. If we get into a trade war, that's not good for the markets or the economy,\" says Bob Doll, chief stock strategist at Nuveen Asset Management.\n\nForeign trade supports about 13% of the U.S. economy. A mega trade war would hurt growth.\n\nRelated: U.S. entrepreneur says Trump's China tariffs are a bad idea\n\n2. Trump is unpredictable\n\nAnother concern about Trump is that he's unpredictable. He speaks off the cuff, and he's changed some positions during his campaign (that's without counting the times he's switched political parties and policies during this lifetime).\n\nBusiness leaders and investors hate uncertainty. They want to know who and what they're dealing with. Trump is the ultimate wild card, which could make businesses -- and the American people -- scared to invest and spend.\n\n\"The simple answer is the market is going to get worried or have its uncertainty concerns anytime there is a non-establishment candidate,\" says Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede.\n\n3. Deporting 11 million people\n\nMore people working powers an economy. Trump's plan to deport over 11 million undocumented immigrants would shrink the U.S. population by about 3%.\n\nThat could be a big hit to the economy. Almost overnight, the U.S. would have fewer people working. That said, policy experts see this proposal as unlikely to come to pass.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump says he's 'ready' for Megyn Kelly at Fox debate\n\n4. Making stuff more expensive\n\nIf Trump did put tariffs on Chinese and Mexican goods, it would make them more expensive. Basic household goods at even big box retail stores like Walmart (WMT) or Target (TGT) would possibly cost a lot more if Trump did the 25% or more fee he has tossed out while campaigning.\n\nIt would be an immediate hit to lower and middle class family budgets. Even worse, it could cause people to spend less because they're worried about items getting even more expensive in the future. People buying things drives about 70% of the U.S. economy.\n\nAny slowdown in spending would translate to lower growth and yes, possibly recession.\n\n5. Running up the national debt\n\nTrump's tax plan would cut taxes for most Americans and businesses. While his tax plan alone could help create jobs, there's a big tradeoff: Trump would cause government debt to skyrocket.\n\nAn in-depth analysis by the Tax Policy Center finds that his plan would add $9.5 trillion to the debt over the first decade. The Tax Policy Center calls it \"likely unsustainable.\"\n\nIn the short-run, his tax plan could boost growth, but over time, the growing debt would choke growth.\n\nStill, many on Wall Street are skeptical that Trump would enact policies that actually hurt business. They expect he would become more moderate if elected.\n\n\"What does he care most about? His image. He wants to be a guy known as a great businessman. He's going to be pro-business,\" says Kevin Kelly, chief investment officer at Recon Capital Partners.\n\nBut Romney ended his speech with a warning: \"If Donald Trump's plans were ever implemented, the country would sink into a prolonged recession.\"",

        "text": "Donald Trump claims trade with Mexico and China is killing America's middle class. Corporate America says that's false.\n\n\"History shows that trade made easy, affordable and fast...always begets more trade, more jobs, more prosperity,\" the founder and CEO of FedEx wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed.\n\nWho's right? Take a look at what has happened to blue-collar workers.\n\nManufacturing jobs in the U.S. actually increased in the years after the North America Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada went into effect in 1994.\n\nBut the story changed dramatically in 2000. Since then, the U.S. has shed 5 million manufacturing jobs, a fact opponents of free trade mention often.\n\nOver 12 million Americans still work in manufacturing\n\nTrump and Bernie Sanders blame China for undercutting American workers with cheap labor (even Trump makes a lot of his suits and ties overseas). But there's another big factor: technology. Robots and machines are also replacing workers. The tech trend would have happened regardless of trade.\n\nStill, manufacturing remains a key part of the U.S. economy. Over 12.3 million Americans are employed in the industry. But it's not the powerhouse it was.\n\nRelated: Americans fear a life of 'dead-end crap jobs with crap wages'\n\nIn 1960, about one in four American workers had a job in manufacturing. Today fewer than one in 10 are employed in the sector, according to government data.\n\nCall it the Great Shift. Workers transitioned from the fields to the factories. Now they are moving from factories to service counters and health care centers. The fastest growing jobs in America now are nurses, personal care aides, cooks, waiters, retail salespersons and operations managers.\n\nTrump's trade talk is 'bluster'\n\nTrade likely sped up the shift, but many experts say it was inevitable. It's unlikely many manufacturing jobs will ever return, even if Trump's walls get built.\n\n\"Trump's talk on trade is bluster,\" says economist Charles Ballard of Michigan State University. \"Even if you did [what Trump says], you wouldn't reverse the technology, which is a very big part of the picture.\"\n\nTrump's threat to put hefty taxes on Chinese and Mexican goods coming into the country would likely to sink the economy into a recession. It would make many items at the store more expensive for working class Americans and spark a global trade war.\n\nThe U.S. tried this tactic in the 1930s with a law known as Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. It backfired, pulling the U.S. further into the Great Depression.\n\nRelated: Why Americans are so angry in 2016\n\nMany manufacturing jobs are lower middle class\n\nThe deeper question is whether the 5 million manufacturing positions that have been lost were truly that great. To put it another way, were the jobs lost really better than the jobs that have replaced them?\n\nSince the 1960s, manufacturing has always paid substantially more than the minimum wage. Even today, the manufacturing jobs that remain average $20.17 an hour. That's nearly three times the federal minimum wage.\n\nIt's enough to vault a worker solidly into the lower middle class, although he or she still would earn less than the true middle -- $53,657 a year.\n\nMention \"blue collar,\" and most Americans visualize an auto worker. Someone who is middle class with a good salary and benefits despite not having a college degree.\n\nBut the reality is manufacturing in America is (and always has) included a wide variety of positions. They range from clothing workers who make less than $25,000 a year on average to supervisors and plant operators who typically make almost $60,000 a year.\n\nRelated: Workplace accidents led to nearly 3,000 amputations in 2015\n\nUnemployment in the U.S. is low again because people have found work despite the manufacturing jobs disappearing.\n\nThe jobs former manufacturing workers have moved into -- health care, construction and retail -- also vary greatly in pay, benefits and quality.\n\n\"Certain industries have declined and others have risen,\" says Harvard professor and trade expert Robert Lawrence. \"In aggregate, the economy is close to full employment.\"\n\n--CNNMoney's Patrick Gillespie contributed to this report.",

        "text": "The dollar-euro parity party may never come.\n\nThe strong dollar's rally could be on its final breath after a remarkable run last year. The value of the dollar has fallen this this year against the euro, Russian ruble, Brazilian real and even the Mexican peso.\n\n\"We have a view that the dollar has likely already peaked,\" says Paul Eitelman, investment strategist at Russell Investments.\n\nThose losses aren't small either: Brazil is in a historic recession, yet the dollar is down 10% against the real in 2016. It's fallen 8% against the bankruptcy-ridden ruble, about 5% versus the euro and it just went into the red against the peso. All those economies are much weaker right now than the U.S.\n\nOn Thursday, an index that tracks the dollar compared to the world's most traded currencies fell to its lowest level since October.\n\nThis is quite a reversal from last year, when there was buzz that the value of the dollar and the euro would become equal -- or reach parity. On March 30, 2015, one euro equaled $1.04. Now one euro equals $1.14, a big shift in the world of currencies.\n\nLast March, the dollar had its biggest rally in 40 years. Now the narrative has clearly changed significantly.\n\nRelated: Yellen: Global risks could hurt the U.S. economy\n\nMuch of the hype last year centered around the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade. When rates go up, the dollar rallies.\n\nAnd in December, the Fed projected it would raise rates four times in 2016.\n\nHowever, since then the expectations have been dialed down. Two weeks ago the Fed cuts its forecast to two rate hikes this year.\n\nAnd Fed Chair Janet Yellen completely cut the music on Tuesday. The dollar was just beginning to recover from a volatile start to the year, and then Yellen expressed plenty of concern about the global economy in a speech in New York.\n\nHer comments squashed any talk of a rate hike in April and dimmed expectations for the rest of the year. Fewer rate hikes mean a weaker dollar.\n\n\"Dollar still suffering from post-Yellen hangover,\" headlined a research note by Win Thin, head of emerging market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.\n\nPotential Fed rate hikes later this year could strengthen the dollar, but experts believe much of the dollar's big gains are in the rear view mirror. That's a good sign for Corporate America: Profits from global businesses have been hurt by the dollar's gains. A stable or weaker dollar could help stocks pick up more momentum.\n\n--Heather Long contributed reporting to this article",

She signed up to volunteer for his campaign. And last week, she sent him a copy of her resume.\n\n\"I have no way to recover from this horrible economy. I am voting for Mr. Trump because I have no other choice,\" she told CNNMoney.\n\nNorris is in her early 50s. She spent most of her career building ships and gadgets for the U.S. military. In June, she lost her job at a defense contractor. Funding for the Littoral Combat Ship project she was working on was slashed.\n\nShe went from earning over $100,000 to nothing.\n\nRelated: Americans fear a life of 'dead-end crap jobs with crap wages'\n\n\"It's really hard to live on $0 income,\" says Norris, who spends her time scouring through job openings and applying for at least 10 each day. \"I go to resume workshops, job fairs, networking groups. I do all that stuff.\"\n\nWhy not send a resume to Trump, she thought.\n\n\"I know that some of Trump's statements are outrageous,\" Norris says. \"But this country needs someone who knows how to run a successful business, not a long-term politician.\"\n\nTrump hasn't contacted her yet, but a Trump presidency would likely help her industry. At the CNN Town Hall Tuesday, Trump vowed to beef up the U.S. military, which likely means more defense spending.\n\n\"If I get in, our military will be bigger, better, stronger than ever before. It's the cheapest thing we can do,\" he said.\n\nNorris has only had three interviews since she lost her job last summer. She attends a weekly meeting with other unemployed workers. She often sees the same people, mostly software and networking engineers. All were middle class. All are in shock about being jobless with so few prospects.\n\nRelated: Elizabeth Warren says Trump is right about 1 thing\n\nNorris seems to be in exactly the spot that many Americans fear -- that they are just one step away from financial ruin. Voters continue to say the economy is their top concern, even though unemployment is low and the country is growing.\n\nAmericans are advised to study hard and go to college. Norris did that. She earned a college degree in science. She went into the engineering field, steadily moving up in responsibility and pay. For many years she worked as an independent contractor before being hired full-time. She saved up with the hope of buying a home.\n\nThen her plan was derailed. Between health issues and losing her job at General Electric (GE) in 2013, she ran her savings down. Then her 401(k).\n\n\"You think you're OK and you get your nest egg started and then it's gone,\" Norris said, citing car payments, COBRA, rent and unexpected medical bills from a surgery that didn't go as planned.\n\nAt the end of 2014, she landed the job working on the ship. It seemed like a godsend, but it lasted only a few months. She doesn't have much savings left.\n\nRelated: U.S. has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000\n\nNow she's effectively homeless. She lives with a friend because she can no longer pay rent on her own. Norris applies for any job, including those at the mall.\n\nHer advice to younger Americans is to study multiple subjects in college and plan for a backup career -- something like hairdressing that can't be outsourced or cut by Congress.\n\nTrump employs about 22,450 workers in his organization, according to an estimate by PrivCo, which tracks private companies. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Norris' resume or volunteer work for the campaign.\n\nThe message from this engineer to Trump? \"I am eight months unemployed. I hope you are my knight in shining armor. I hate $0 income,\" says Norris.",

        "text": "Donald Trump argues that America loses big time on trade.\n\n\"The great American middle class is disappearing. One of the factors driving this economic devastation is America's disastrous trade policies,\" Trump wrote in a new op-ed in USA Today.\n\nHe says he'll use his deal making skills to turn America back into a winner in trade with China, Mexico and others.\n\nBut business leaders and economists from both sides of the aisle warn Trump's idea to slap hefty fees on Chinese and Mexican imports -- as much as 45% -- would be disastrous for the economy.\n\nHere's a rundown of Trump's key arguments on trade. Exit polls show the issue is winning Trump votes. He hopes it will lead to victory in Ohio in a close matchup with Governor John Kasich.\n\nRelated: Donald J. Trump ties and suits are made in China\n\n1. Trump's claim: Trade is killing jobs\n\n\"The American worker is being crushed\" by trade, Trump says. As proof, he cites research from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute that found America has lost 900,000 jobs to Mexico since the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in late 1993.\n\nThe job losses are the subject of a huge debate. Other research by the right-leaning U.S. Chamber of Commerce says 5 million U.S. jobs have been created because of NAFTA.\n\nRegardless, this discussion ignores the impact of technology and innovation on traditional middle class jobs.\n\n\"Trade is a factor, but technological change has been more important,\" says Robert Lawrence, professor of international trade at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Computers and robots are replacing manufacturing jobs. The predictions are that even more positions -- including \"highly skilled\" ones -- will be replaced by robots in the coming years.\n\nTrump says \"I am the only candidate in this race who will bring our manufacturing jobs back,\" but he doesn't seem to be addressing the real cause of the decline in manufacturing jobs: machines.\n\nRelated: Is trade really killing middle class jobs?\n\n2. Trump: Ohio has lost 100,000 jobs to trade\n\nIn his op-ed, Trump argues that states like Ohio have been especially hard hit by trade. \"An Economic Policy Institute analysis found that Ohio has already lost more than 100,000 jobs to Trans-Pacific Partnership countries,\" he writes.\n\nHere's the catch: Ohio has a 4.9% unemployment rate, meaning the state is basically at full employment. While it's true that some jobs have been lost, others are being created. For example, Ohio has benefited from America's energy boom and a resurgence of steel jobs to make the pipes to transport natural gas.\n\nRelated: How Donald Trump could cause a recession\n\n3. Trump's plan: The art of the (trade) deal\n\nTrump solution is to renegotiate trade agreements (the U.S. currently has 20 free-trade deals in place) and put taxes (known as tariffs) on Chinese and Mexican imports.\n\nThe idea is to make Chinese and Mexican goods more expensive so companies will start manufacturing in the U.S. again.\n\nThe problem is China and Mexico aren't likely to send Trump a thank you note. They would probably retaliate by putting taxes on U.S. goods coming into their countries. It could cause a global trade war.\n\n\"His plan to put on a 35% tariff on goods imported would sink this country into a recession. It would penalize global companies that are trying to be competitive globally,\" HP Enterprises (HPE) CEO Meg Whitman, a prominent Republican, said recently.\n\nThe American Action Forum, a right-leaning think tank, estimates that Trump's tariffs on China would cost Americans an average of $675 per person a year. (The Mexico tariff would cost over $100 a person).\n\nRelated: The Trump business that failed in two years\n\n4. Trump says stop the TPP trade deal\n\nTrump has a big warning about the future: \"The situation is about to get drastically worse if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is not stopped. One of the first casualties of the TPP will be America's auto industry, and among the worst victims of this pact will be the people of Ohio.\"\n\nHe points out that his rivals for the Republican nomination -- Gov. Kasich, Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio -- all support TPP.\n\nTPP is a trade agreement that's been years in the making. It would create a free trade zone around the Pacific Ocean, bringing together 12 countries that account for 40% of the world's economy. China is not part of the agreement, so the deal could help contain China's economic influence.\n\nThere's a lot of debate about whether TPP will help or hurt U.S. jobs and businesses. Much like with NAFTA, there will likely be some industries that benefit and some that are hurt. The U.S. auto industry is actually expected to be one of the winners from the deal.\n\nRelated: Why Americans are so angry in 2016\n\nThe bottom line\n\nBashing trade is helping Trump win votes. But both Republican and Democratic experts warn his plan to \"fix\" trade deals could cause an economic war that leaves Americans even worse off.",

Another casino owned by the company, the Trump Plaza, is expected to shut down after Sept. 16, costing 1,046 employees their jobs.\n\nDonald Trump himself sued a unit of Trump Plaza Associates in early August, claiming that its casinos were no longer good enough to bear his name.\n\nDonald Trump actually built the casinos and once owned them. But he said his only current relationship was the licensing of his name. He said that they have since fallen into disrepair.\n\nThe company, in its court filing, estimates assets worth between $10 million and $50 million, and liabilities worth between $100 million and $500 million. The documents identified 30 debtors, the most prominent being Thermal Energy Limited Partnership I, an operator of heating and cooling equipment which is owed nearly $3 million.\n\nThe Taj Mahal filing is the latest problem in the Jersey Shore city. Revel, the luxury casino where NFL player Ray Rice attacked his future wife, is expected to close on Wednesday, putting 3,100 employees out of work.\n\nAnother casino, Showboat, closed on Aug. 31, putting 2,100 people out of work. And the Atlantic Club Casino Hotel shut down in January, ending 1,600 jobs.\n\nRepresentatives of Donald Trump declined comment on Tuesday's filing.",

        "text": "Fox's GOP debate was watched by 24 million viewers on Thursday night, according to Nielsen data, making it the highest-rated primary debate in television history.\n\nThe event, featuring Donald Trump in his first debate, was also the highest-rated telecast in the nearly 20 year history of the Fox News Channel, a spokeswoman said.\n\nRival executives and campaign aides also predicted unusually high ratings for the event, thanks to curiosity about Trump and the controversy over the \"top ten\" candidate criteria.\n\nBut the ratings shattered even the rosiest expectations for the beginning of debate season. Television executives were stunned.\n\nFor perspective, the first GOP primary debate four years ago, also on Fox, attracted 3.2 million viewers.\n\nThe most-watched primary debate that year, broadcast by ABC, reached 7.6 million.\n\nThursday's debate audience more than tripled that one.\n\nThe audience easily exceeded pretty much everything that's been on American television this year, from the finale of \"The Walking Dead\" to the final episode of David Letterman's \"Late Show.\"\n\nThe debate was bigger than all of this year's NBA Finals and MLB World Series games, and most of the year's NFL match-ups.\n\nIt also trumped Jon Stewart's Thursday night's sign-off from \"The Daily Show,\" which averaged 3.5 million viewers.\n\nTrump is a known ratings magnet. His reality show \"The Celebrity Apprentice\" used to reach 20 million viewers a week. But it has slipped over the years, averaging 6 to 8 million viewers for recent seasons.\n\nNow, through the debate process, it seems, Trump's ratings are back up.\n\n(Naturally, he took credit for the sky-high ratings in a tweet.)\n\nFor Trump and the nine other people on stage who want to be president, the exposure was enormously valuable.\n\nConversely, about 6.1 million viewers tuned in for the \"undercard\" debate at 5 p.m. That means the seven candidates who didn't make the cut for prime time, like Rick Perry, reached just a quarter as many viewers.\n\nThe ratings are good news not only for Fox but for other media organizations that are sponsoring Republican debates. The \"Trump show,\" as some have called it, seems likely to continue into the fall.\n\nThe next debates are set for September 16 (on CNN) and October 28 (on CNBC).\n\nRelated: has Fox News turned against Donald Trump?\n\nFox News typically has between 2 and 3 million viewers in prime time, so the debate was at least an eight-fold increase.\n\nThere was a spike in viewership right at 9 p.m. as the debate began, and the audience stayed for the whole thing. Fox peaked at one point with 26.8 million viewers.\n\nA post-game show anchored by Megyn Kelly had 11.1 million viewers, a 1000% increase over the time slot's usual total viewership.\n\nGabriel Debenedetti of Politico noted that more people watched the prime time debate \"than voted over the course of the entire 2012 GOP primary (18.9 million).\"\n\nOn Thursday night there was immediate indication of the audience's interest: the debate dominated social chatter on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThere was also trouble with Fox's web stream.\n\nFox made the debate available online to cable and satellite subscribers, but many users on Twitter said they had a tough time accessing it.\n\nA Fox spokeswoman confirmed the problems and said \"an unprecedented, overwhelming demand caused server issues in the debate live stream.\"\n\nThe Future of Media, a customized magazine",

Only a few weeks ago, Icahn, a 79-year-old billionaire famous for pressuring companies to restructure, told Trump \"no thanks\" to the offer to be Treasury Secretary.\n\n\"I was extremely surprised to learn that Donald was running for president and even more surprised that he stated he would make me Secretary of Treasury,\" wrote Icahn in a June 19 blog post.\n\nBut since then, Trump's \"surprise\" candidacy has picked up momentum. He's surging in the polls, and he was by far the most talked about candidate at the debate.\n\nRelated: No one eclipses Donald Trump at GOP debate\n\n1/3 After last night's debate I decided to accept @realDonaldTrump offer for Secretary of Treasury. — Carl Icahn (@Carl_C_Icahn) August 7, 2015\n\nTrump has yet to lay out an economic plan, but he's stressed his business success and ability to create jobs. In the first debate, he claimed he could \"straighten out\" the national debt.\n\nTrump originally suggested that Icahn would make a good Treasury Secretary in an appearance on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" in June. One of the show's hosts asked Trump who he might pick to help guide the nation's budget and economy.\n\n\"I'd love to bring my friend Carl Icahn,\" Trump said on the show. Trump also mentioned private equity titan Henry Kravis and former GE (GE) CEO Jack Welch as top Treasury Secretary candidates.\n\nTrump followed that up this week by saying Icahn would be the right man to negotiate with China and Japan.\n\nBut while Trump's star may be rising, Icahn's funds are not. The stock of Icahn Enterprises (IEP) is down 17% this year. That comes after a 2014, when Icahn Enterprises shares lost nearly 30%.",

He has since been licensing his name and image to the company that bought the casinos.\n\nTrump's lawsuit, filed in August, accused the company of neglecting the casinos and allowing them \"to fall into an utter state of disrepair.\" The neglect violated the license agreement, under which the brand's \"superior reputation\" must be used in a \"dignified manner\" consistent with the \"highest quality.\"\n\nRelated: Revel sold at bankruptcy auction\n\nTrump Plaza went out of business in September, becoming the fourth casino in Atlantic City to shut down this year, putting 8,000 people out of work.\n\nOne of the shut-down casinos - Revel - was sold at bankruptcy auction for $110 million on Oct. 1 to Brookfield Asset Management.\n\n\"Atlantic City needs a total remake,\" said Trump.",

        "text": "Donald Trump is finally showing us more of his economic plan beyond the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan on his red hat.\n\nAmerica has now learned:\n\n-- He wants to tax the rich more and the middle class less.\n\n-- He wants to lower corporate taxes.\n\n-- He wants to cut government spending and stop raising the debt ceiling.\n\n\"The hedge fund people make a lot of money and they pay very little tax,\" Trump said in an interview Wednesday with Bloomberg. \"I want to lower taxes for the middle class.\"\n\nIn short, Trump is willing to raise taxes on himself and those like him.\n\nMany hedge fund managers and real estate investors are able to list their earnings as \"carried interest\" because of an IRS tax rule. They are able to cast their earnings as investment gains instead of income, which allows them to be taxed at a lower rate.\n\n\"You've seen my statements. I do very well. I don't mind paying a little more in taxes. The middle class is getting clobbered in this country,\" he said.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump trounces GOP field\n\nEliminate \"inheritance\" tax or worry about inequality\n\nTrump has been all over the place on taxes over the years. He criticized President Obama for not wanting to keep the Bush tax cuts in place on the wealthiest Americans. He has also proposed eliminating the so-called \"estate tax\" on people that inherit money, gifts and property from their parents. Both moves would be a major gain for the rich.\n\nNow Trump is starting to sound more populist.\n\n\"The middle class built this country, not the hedge fund guys,\" he said Wednesday.\n\n\"One of the reasons he is winning votes is he's talking about the macro issues that so frustrate many Americans and seem so blatantly unfair,\" says Peter Morici, a professor of economics at University of Maryland's Robert Smith school of business.\n\nLower corporate taxes and bring $2.5 trillion home\n\nTrump also wants to even the playing field on taxes that businesses pay. He believes that lowering the corporate tax rate will stop American companies from trying to move their headquarters -- and possibly jobs -- overseas in an effort to dodge taxes in the U.S.\n\nMany U.S. companies such as Apple (AAPL) have huge cash reserves that they could spend on growing their businesses, but that money is mostly held overseas to avoid U.S. taxes. Trump estimates as much as $2.5 trillion could return to America if taxes were lower.\n\n\"This is money that could be spent in this country,\" he said. \"We have companies with thousands of jobs that are leaving this country.\"\n\nRelated: U.S. companies hoard record amounts of cash\n\nWashington is full of \"scandalous\" waste\n\nTrump was also asked about whether he would continue to raise America's debt ceiling.\n\nThe standoff between President Obama and Republicans in Congress over whether to raise the ceiling in 2011 caused U.S. debt to lose its AAA rating.\n\nRepublicans should fight Obama again over the issue, Trump argues, even if it causes pain in financial markets.\n\n\"I think there's so much waste, so much scandalous waste in Washington that we shouldn't have to [raise the debt ceiling],\" he said.\n\nTrump continues to lead the GOP field solidly. Rivals accuse him of not having real plans.\n\n\"The big issues he talks about do make some sense,\" says Morici. \"The question is...is there really much substance there or is this just a few phrases?\"",

        "text": "But what does it do and how does it really work? CNBC explains.\n\nWhat is the Dodd-Frank Act?\n\nThe full name of the bill is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, but it is better known and most often referred to as Dodd-Frank.\n\nIn simple terms, Dodd-Frank is a law that places major regulations on the financial industry. It grew out of the Great Recession with the intention of preventing another collapse of a major financial institution like Lehman Brothers.\n\nDodd-Frank is also geared toward protecting consumers with rules like keeping borrowers from abusive lending and mortgage practices by banks.\n\nIt became the law of the land in 2010 and was named after Senator Christopher J. Dodd (D-CT) and U.S. Representative Barney Frank (D-MA), who were the sponsors of the legislation.\n\nBut not all of the provisions are in place and some rules are subject to change, as we'll see.\n\nThe bill contains some 16 major areas of reform and contains hundreds of pages, but we will focus here on what are considered the major rules of regulation.\n\nOne of the main goals of the Dodd-Frank act is to have banks subjected to a number of regulations along with the possibility of being broken up if any of them are determined to be “too big to fail.”\n\nTo do that, the act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). It looks out for risks that affect the entire financial industry.\n\nThe Council is chaired by the Treasury Secretary, and has nine members including the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or CFPA. It also oversees non-bank financial firms like hedge funds .\n\nIf any of the banks gets too big in the council's determination, they could be be regulated by the Federal Reserve, which can ask a bank to increase its reserve requirement—the money it has 'saved up' and is not using for lending or business costs.\n\nUnder Dodd-Frank, banks are also required to have plans for a quick and orderly shutdown in the event that the bank becomes insolvent—or runs out of money.\n\nWhat is the Volcker Rule?\n\nThe Volcker Rule is part of Dodd-Frank and prohibits banks from owning, investing, or sponsoring hedge funds, private equity funds, or any proprietary trading operations for their own profit.\n\nTo help banks figure out which funds are for their profits and which funds are for customers, the Fed has given banks two years to divest their own funds in get in line with the rule before it's enforced.\n\nHowever banks can keep any funds that are less than three percent of revenue.\n\nThe Volcker Rule does allow some trading when it's necessary for the bank to run its business. For example, banks can engage in currency trading to offset their own holdings in a foreign currency.\n\nBut the Volcker rule is not in place yet, and some of its rules are still being decided. It is scheduled to go into effect in July 2012. However, regulators say they might not have all the rules in place by then.\n\nHow does Dodd-Frank affect derivatives?\n\nDodd-Frank requires that the riskiest derivatives—like credit default swaps—be regulated by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC).\n\nTo help make them more transparent, a clearinghouse of sorts— similar to the stock exchange—must be set up so these derivative trades can be transacted in public.\n\nBut Dodd-Frank left it up to the regulators to determine exactly the best way to put this clearinghouse into place.\n\nAnd not all derivatives will be subject to the law. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved a rule that would exempt some energy companies, hedge funds and banks from derivative oversight.\n\nHow are insurance companies affected by Dodd-Frank?\n\nThe law created a new Federal Insurance Office (FIO) under the Treasury Department, which would identify insurance companies, like AIG, that create risk to the entire system.\n\nAIG was caught in in a major liquidity crisis when its credit ratings were downgraded in September 2008. The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank had to step in and create an $85 billion emergency fund—taxpayer money—to help AIG meet increased financial payouts.\n\nThe new FIO will also gather information about the insurance industry and make sure affordable insurance is available to minorities.\n\nAre credit rating agencies regulated by Dodd-Frank?\n\nYes. Dodd-Frank created an Office of Credit Rating at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate credit ratings agencies like Moody's and Standard & Poor's.\n\nThe agencies were criticized for helping to create the 2008 recession by misleading investors through over-rating derivatives and mortgage-backed securities—and saying the investment tools were worth more than their actual value.\n\nAs part of the new rules, the SEC can require agencies to submit their rating systems for review, and can de-certify an agency that gives misleading ratings.\n\nHow are consumers protected?\n\nDodd-Frank created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau(CFPB), to protect consumers from 'unscrupulous business' practices by banks. The CFPB consolidated a number of existing consumer protection responsibilities in other government agencies.\n\nThe CFPB works with regulators in large banks to stop transactions that hurt consumers, such as risky lending. The CFPB also provides consumers with access to 'plain English' information about mortgages and credit scores along with a 24-hour toll-free consumer hotline to report issues with financial services.\n\nThe CFPB also oversees credit reporting agencies, credit and debit cards, payday and consumer loans— but not auto loans from dealers.\n\nWhat is the whistle blower provision?\n\nTo help fight corruption and insider trading, the Dodd-Frank Act contains a whistle-blowing provision. Someone with information about security violations can report it to the government for a financial reward.\n\nWhat is the debate over Dodd-Frank?\n\nFor many on Wall Street, Dodd-Frank is seen as an overreaction to the recession of 2008, one that will push investors to the sidelines, burden financial institutions with cumbersome rules, and stop overall economic growth.\n\nOthers see it as a way to protect their investors and cut down on unnecessary risk as well as protect consumers.\n\nThere are some critics, including a Fed official, who say the regulations don't go far enough to reign in an out-of-control Wall Street bent on taking risks and then being bailed out by public tax dollars.\n\nThose in favor of the bill say that had the rules been in place, the recession might not have happened—while many analysts say that if the markets, Congress, and regulators had just followed the existing rules, the financial collapse could have been avoided.\n\nFor now, Dodd-Frank mostly remains a lightning rod—too much regulation for some and not enough for others. Its affect on Wall Street will take some time to measure.",

        "text": "Yet most people have little idea how the Fed works, what it actually does and why its decisions have so much impact. Here are the details.\n\nWhat is the Federal Reserve?\n\nThe Fed is the gatekeeper of the U.S. economy and is part of the federal government.\n\nBased in Washington, D.C., the Fed is the bank of the U.S. government and regulates the nation's financial institutions. It's comprised of a network of 12 Federal Reserve Banks and a number of branches. This is all overseen by the Fed's Board of Governors, which we'll detail a little later.\n\nBesides being the nation's central bank, the Fed studies economic trends and makes policy decisions on how to make the economy \"run better.\"\n\nThe Fed is an independent agency—which means it can make decisions on its own, without needing approval from any other branch of government. However, it is subject to questions from Congress over its actions. The Federal Reserve chairman regularly testifies to both the Senate and the House.\n\nBut while the Fed has to explain itself, it is theoretically free from political pressure. One caveat on this 'freedom'—Fed board members are nominated by the President and must be approved by the Senate.\n\nWhat does the Federal Reserve System do?\n\nThe Fed's mandate is \"to promote sustainable growth, high levels of employment, stability of prices to help preserve the purchasing power of the dollar and moderate long-term interest rates,\" according to the Federal Reserve's web site.\n\nWhat does that mean? The Fed has to make sure the U.S. has a sound banking system and a healthy economy.\n\n\n\nTo do that, the Fed makes decisions over monetary policy to help maintain employment, keep prices stable, and keep interest rates at a level that helps the economy. It also supervises and regulates banks to make sure they are safe places for people to keep their money, and to protect consumers' credit rights.\n\nBut there's more.\n\nThe Fed plays a major role in clearing checks, processing electronic payments, and distributing coin and paper money to the nation's banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations. For example, when you cash a check or have money electronically transferred, there is a good chance that a Fed Bank will handle the transfer of money from one bank to another.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System also conducts research on the U.S. and regional economies and distributes information about the economy to the public through published articles, speeches by board members, seminars and web sites.\n\nThis information is released to the public as part of the Fed's mandate to study the economy.\n\nTwo important outlets for this information are:\n\nThe Beige Book—named this way because of the report's tan cover . It's a report published eight times per year. Each Federal Reserve bank gathers anecdotal information on current economic conditions in its district. The beige book generally consists of reports from bank and branch directors and interviews with key business contacts, economists, market experts, and other sources.\n\nIt's a report published eight times per year. Each Federal Reserve bank gathers anecdotal information on current economic conditions in its district. The beige book generally consists of reports from bank and branch directors and interviews with key business contacts, economists, market experts, and other sources. Fed Minutes—these are notes from discussions the Federal Open Market Committee has over economic policy. They are released eight times a year, after each meeting. They often detail disagreements between members over what policy to follow.\n\nThese two reports are followed very closely—by the stock market and economists in general— to gauge how the economy is doing and what the Federal Reserve board is thinking.\n\nWhen was the Federal Reserve created and why?\n\nThe U.S. Congress created the Federal Reserve System on December 23, 1913, with the signing of the Federal Reserve Act by then-President Woodrow Wilson.\n\nBefore then, the U.S. has had two major periods of central banks—which could be considered an over-simplified form of the Federal Reserve—one starting in 1791 and the other in 1816. Each was an attempt to create a disciplined banking policy and help avoid economic collapses.\n\nHowever, fears of a central bank being too powerful in setting financial policy brought about their ends. Congress failed to renew the first national bank's charter in 1811.\n\nThe 1816 central bank period ended in 1836 when then President Andrew Jackson refused to renew its charter—claiming the bank would be run, in his words, by \"Eastern Elites.\"\n\nHowever, a series of U.S. bank collapses in 1873, 1893 and especially in 1907, pushed many in Congress to call once again for a centralized banking system.\n\nIn 1907, there was a massive run on the banks—people demanding their money—and the banks started recalling all of their loans to pay off customers. This was started after large blocks of fraudulent stocks and bonds were sold to corner the market on one firm—the United Copper Company.\n\nThe scheme failed and banks who were part of the effort went bankrupt—and that spread to other banks across the country.\n\nThe bank panic of 1907 resulted in a congressional investigation that concluded: \"a central bank was necessary so that these kinds of panics would never happen again.\"\n\nHowever, it wasn't until 1913 before a law was actually passed—when Congress was able to work out a compromise on the Fed's mandate.\n\nWhat is monetary policy?\n\nWe've mentioned that the Fed makes decisions over monetary policy. So what is that? It's the regulation of interest rates and the availability of money in order to provide economic growth and prevent downturns. This is the nuts and bolts of what the Fed does.\n\nIf the economy needs to grow faster and create more jobs, the Fed can supply more credit to banks for lending.\n\nIt can also lower interest rates that banks use to borrow money from the Fed, making it cheaper for banks to lend. This is referred to as the Discount Rate—the interest rate that an eligible depository institution is charged to borrow short-term funds directly from a Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nThe Fed can also lower banks' reserves—meaning banks would need to carry less money on their books—and can lend more to businesses and consumers as well as to other banks. This tactic increases the money supply in the economy.\n\nAnother way the Fed increases the money supply is by buying government securities, like treasury bonds, from the public. This is a form of what's called quantitative easing . Buying government securities makes more money available with the aim of increasing consumer spending and boosting the economy.\n\nNow, if the Fed believes the economy is growing too fast and needs to slow down and avoid inflation—the increased costs of goods and services—it's going to do the opposite of what we've just mentioned.\n\nTo put some brakes on the economy, the Fed will increase interest rates for borrowing, make banks hold on to more of their money and therefore decrease lending. It will also stop buying securities, a strategy that in turn cuts down on the amount of money that's in the economy.\n\nWhat is the FOMC?\n\nThis is the group within the Fedthat makes the decisions we just mentioned. FOMC stands for the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe FOMC meets eight times per year to set key interest rates and to decide whether to increase or decrease the money supply—which the Fed does by buying and selling government securities.\n\nThe FOMC consists of 12 members—the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the other 11 Reserve Bank presidents.\n\nRead MoreVideo: How do Fed Open Market operations work?\n\nThe four Reserve Bank presidents serve one-year terms on a rotating basis. Non-voting Reserve Bank presidents attend the meetings of the Committee, participate in discussions, and contribute information about economic conditions in their District.\n\nWhere does the Fed get its money?\n\nThe Federal Reserve makes money—lots of it. The Fed had over $4.5 trillion in assets, as of March 12, 2015. The majority of revenue comes from open market operations—specifically the interest on the Fed's portfolio of Treasury securities as well as the money that comes from the buying/selling of the securities and their derivatives.\n\nOther Fed revenue come from sales of financial services like check and electronic payment processing and discount loans to banks. There's also interest on foreign deposits within the Federal Banking system.\n\nHowever, the Fed doesn't really keep the money. The government receives all of the system's annual profits—after certain expenses. In 2014, the Fed sent $98.7 billion of its $101.5 billion total net income in 2014 to the U.S. Treasury.",

        "text": "National debt is the sum of all outstanding debt owed by the federal government. It includes not only the money the government has borrowed, but also the interest it must pay on the borrowed money. The government goes into debt when it doesn't collect enough revenue to cover the expenses it incurs from spending on programs such as the military, or building roads and bridges. The revenues come from corporate and income taxes, and the fees the government imposes, such as for visas and passports, student loans, and admission to national parks.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Deficit?\n\nThe deficit refers to the difference, in a single year, between government receipts and spending. Those deficits become the national debt when they are added together. They're tied to each other, but they're different.\n\nDeficit spending is sometimes viewed as temporary but necessary. For the government, that might be true if it needs to spend money to fight a war. For a person, it might be true if he or she wants to take out a loan to buy a car.\n\nBut over time, running large annual deficits is a bad thing, for the government and for the average person. Here's why: think of the government's annual deficit spending like a person using a credit card to spend above his or her means. If that type of spending continues year after year, the interest on the credit card builds up. The minimum payments become larger and larger. Eventually, the charges become so unwieldy that the card holder can't pay them off without making big sacrifices (say, selling the house and the car) or declaring bankruptcy.\n\nIt's also important to note that a government can still have a national debt even if there's no deficit in a specific year. Here's how that works.\n\nIn 2001, for instance, the government had a surplus of $127 billion. However, $127 billion was a surplus for that year alone and did not eliminate the national debt, which at that time was $5.9 trillion — from all the previous years of deficits.\n\nWhat is the Debt Ceiling?\n\nThe debt ceiling is a cap, set by Congress, on how much debt the U.S. government can carry. The debt ceiling idea came about in 1917. Before then, Congress had to approve borrowing for each item when the government needed money.\n\nBut to have more flexibility as the U.S. entered World War I, lawmakers agreed to give the government approval for all borrowing — as long as the total was less than a specific number. That debt limit number — usually set at a high figure — would be set by Congress.\n\nWhenever the government is going to exceed the debt limit, Congress has to vote its approval to raise it.\n\nSo looking at this in real money, the debt ceiling in 2011 is $14.294 trillion. The national debt is more than $14.5 trillion. Congress has to approve raising the debt limit. If it doesn't within a certain time frame, funds would not be available to pay bills.\n\nThe debt ceiling has frequently been raised — 74 times since March 1962 and 10 times since 2001.\n\nHistory of U.S. National Debt\n\nFrom its beginning as a nation, the U.S. has been in debt at one time or another, according to the Bureau of Public Debt. The country has usually spent more than it's taken in order to keep services going.\n\nThe Revolutionary War created a debt of $75 million. The fledgling government had to pay for its soldiers, along with food and supplies. To pay off the debt, the government sold bonds, which we'll see later is one way governments fund themselves.\n\nIt wasn't until 1835 — and after another war, the War of 1812 — that the U.S. was in the black.\n\nThe Civil War produced a massive round of debt, reaching a figure of $2.7 billion by 1864. After 1865, the U.S. ran deficits in 11 of the next 47 years, having surpluses in the other 36.\n\nJumping ahead to the 20th century, a major period of debt followed World War I and the build up for World War II, and social programs to fight the Great Depression caused a major increase in debt to $260 billion by 1950.\n\nOver the years, government's role expanded with programs such as agricultural subsidies, highway construction, Medicare, Medicaid, public education, the federal courts, mail delivery, food and work safety inspectors, law protection agencies like the FBI, among others.\n\nAnd of course there's defense — even with some cuts in the 1990s — leaving the U.S. still spending more for it that any other country.\n\nThe debt continued to grow from $260 billion in 1950 to $909 billion in 1980. Between 1980 and 1990, the debt more than tripled, according to the BPD.",

        "text": "Jim Chanos was betting against China long before it became the trendy thing to do.\n\nAs early as 2009 Chanos correctly realized China's debt-fueled economy wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Back then it was a lonely call for the man who famously predicted Enron's downfall. China, with its explosive growth, was among the brightest spots in the world.\n\nToday his call looks brilliant. China's current economic slowdown is striking fear in the hearts of investors around the world. It is struggling mightily as it transforms from a manufacturing and infrastructure-fueled economy into one built on consumers.\n\n\"That transition will be a lot rockier than people think,\" Chanos told CNN's Poppy Harlow this week from a book-lined conference room at his midtown Manhattan office. For the interview, Chanos wore a pair of cufflinks made of yuan, China's currency.\n\nHis aha moment\n\nThe \"aha\" moment for Chanos came in 2009 when his real estate expert told him China had a stunning 5.6 billion square meters of real estate under development. Surely that must've been a mistake, Chanos thought, because that amounted to over 60 billion square feet.\n\n\"We figured out that was a five-foot-by-five-foot office cubicle for every man, woman and child in Asia,\" he said. Soon after, he made the decision to bet against China.\n\nChanos took big negative positions on energy and commodity companies that rely on the Asian giant. Citing regulatory requirements, Chanos declined to give specifics on how much money he made from going short China.\n\n\"It's been profitable -- very profitable,\" he said.\n\nChina's debt-fueled growth is unsustainable\n\nChanos's specialty is short selling, or betting stocks will fall. He is still disturbed by the amount of government debt China has accumulated.\n\n\"It took us 200 years to get where we are. They've done it basically in five years,\" said Chanos, founder of Kynikos Associates, a $3 billion hedge fund.\n\nBut Chanos argues that kind of debt-fueled growth has backfired in the past, pointing to the Japan in the late 1980s.\n\nRelated: Japan's 'Abenomics' experiment is on the rocks\n\nBetting against natural gas\n\nChanos is still betting against commodity companies that are banking on China to succeed.\n\nHe believes that natural gas will turn out to be massively oversupplied, just like iron ore, copper and coal.\n\n\"Even if demand is okay in Korea, Japan and China, the tsunami of supply coming is going to keep prices low and make the plans uneconomic,\" Chanos said.\n\nLast month Chanos told CNBC he thinks the LNG space is a \"looming disaster\" and that's why he has taken a short position in Cheniere Energy (CQH).\n\nRelated: Cracks emerge in U.S. oil boom\n\nCasinos need to watch out for Xi\n\nChanos is also negative on casino companies with exposure to Macau, China's gambling mecca that has been slammed by the country's anti-corruption drive.\n\nHe said these companies need to watch out even more in the future due to Chinese President Xi Jinping's \"puritanical nature.\"\n\n\"He doesn't like people gambling,\" Chanos said.\n\nMacau, like Hong Kong, is a Special Administrative Region of China. It is also the only place in China where gambling is legal.\n\nRelated: Petraeus: Don't freak out over China dumping U.S. debt\n\nChina's leader worries him quite a bit\n\nChanos was concerned about China's new leadership more broadly.\n\n\"Keep in mind you're dealing with a totalitarian state,\" Chanos said. \"They control the media.\"\n\nChanos argued that the government's role inflating the stock market bubble and attempts to limit the ensuing bust hurts its credibility.\n\nBeijing, meanwhile, has said intervention was necessary to prevent a massive panic.\n\nBetting against Elon Musk\n\nChanos is not afraid to call out tech visionary Elon Musk.\n\nWhile he called Musk's Tesla (TSLA) cars a \"great product,\" Chanos worries the electric car maker will always be a boutique car maker and won't be able to transform into a mass market one.\n\n\"To sell millions of cars -- which is where the stock is valued -- they've got a long way to go,\" Chanos said.\n\nHe also knocked SolarCity (SCTY), the renewable energy company Musk co-founded.\n\n\"It's really nothing more than a consumer finance company -- and it's not a particularly good one,\" Chanos said.\n\nChanos is still shorting Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX). The company has been criticized during a recent political firestorm for buying drugs and then hiking prices -- something Chanos argues is a far bigger part of its business than Valeant is willing to admit.",

Now he's betting against Elon Musk\n\nAs an investor, Chanos isn't one to follow the crowd. He correctly predicted the collapse of Enron and also China's current economic travails.\n\nHe's also not your traditional investor. He makes money by betting on the misfortune of others.\n\nRight now, the founder of Kynikos Associates is down on anything that touches China and even Elon Musk's companies.\n\nBut he's pretty bullish on America.\n\nRelated: Jim Chanos explains why he's shorting Tesla\n\nMy Republican friends would vote for Biden\n\nHe acknowledged that the U.S. still faces a number of challenges. He specifically pointed to the rise of ISIS, gun control and income inequality\n\nChanos believes Vice President Joe Biden might be the best man to tackle those obstacles.\n\n\"I'm certainly hoping he runs,\" Chanos said of his friend. \"He's a candidate that actually can cross the aisle. Some of my Republican friends might even consider voting for him.\"\n\nRelated: Joe Biden for president? One Wall Street billionaire says yes\n\nChanos vs. Trump\n\nAnd Chanos agrees with another presidential candidate Donald Trump, at least on one issue.\n\nTrump has said hedge fund managers are getting away with \"murder\" by paying lower taxes. The Republican presidential candidate has proposed leveling the playing field by abolishing \"carried interest,\" a tax loophole that lets investors pay lower taxes on their profits.\n\nChanos agrees that the rich need to pay more in taxes and the loophole needs to be closed.\n\nBut that doesn't mean Chanos supports Trump for president.",

The company began accepting $1,000 deposits for the car last month, and received more than 325,000 orders in the first week.\n\nThe automaker made a name for itself with two $70,000-plus luxury models -- the Model S and Model X -- but a successful mass market vehicle is the cornerstone of Musk's plan to grow the company.\n\nThe first Model 3's are expected to reach customers next year, and he wants the company's new gigafactory to be churning them out \"at capacity\" by the end of 2017. Musk said the company plans to start making 500,000 cars per year by 2018. For comparison, the company made about 50,000 in 2015.\n\nTo do that, the company is also looking to hire top-tier manufacturing talent, which Musk said is the \"most significant\" factor in ensuring a bright future for Tesla.\n\nIt's unclear why, but the company also announced earlier in the day on Wednesday that its vice presidents of production and manufacturing are leaving the company.\n\nMusk's production plans may face other problems. He has given Tesla suppliers a July 1, 2017 deadline to ship the parts he's ordered, but \"it's like college term papers. There's always late term papers.\"\n\nRelated: Car buyers clamor for Tesla despite reliability concerns\n\nMusk also said he plans to start producing more car components in-house -- another reason he's investing more money in Tesla's manufacturing capabilities.\n\nTesla affirmed earlier guidance that it plans to put 80,000 to 90,000 new electric cars on the road this year, and that's despite hitting a production snag with the Model X recently that made the company miss its quarterly delivery guidance.\n\nAnd the Model S is still selling well. Orders were up 45% compared to the same quarter last year.\n\nTesla's stock has struggled in 2016, down more than 7% since January. Shares were essentially flat after-hours when the company issued its report.",

        "text": "Growth in Africa has outpaced most emerging markets in recent years, but that's changing fast as a slew of problems beset its leading economies.\n\nCheap oil, political uncertainty and weak banks are all to blame.\n\nHere's what you need to know about sub-Saharan Africa's big four:\n\nSouth Africa\n\nThe prospects for Africa's most advanced economy are not looking good. The country is set to grow by just 0.6% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. It's one of the slowest growing countries in one of the world's fastest growing territories.\n\nThe rand plummeted 30% last year, and not just because of an emerging market sell-off. Political turmoil has also had a big impact.\n\nJust this month, South African President Jacob Zuma survived impeachment despite the highest court in the land finding him guilty of breaching the constitution over how public money was spent renovating his home. Well known figures from the anti-apartheid struggle are now calling for Zuma to step down.\n\nChaos in government isn't helping either. Zuma stunned investors by replacing Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene with a little known politician. The president then backtracked and asked Nene's predecessor Pravin Gordhan to take the position in order to stop the rand's freefall.\n\nThe rand has steadied this year, rallying by about 7%. It's been helped by a broader rally in markets driven by rising commodity prices. As a platinum, gold and coal producer, South Africa is sensitive to shifts in the commodity cycle.\n\nBut the country is not out of the woods yet. It's on the brink of a ratings downgrade that would plunge its sovereign debt into junk status.\n\nStill, investors are showing some renewed confidence, buying up $1.86 billion worth of bonds so far in 2016 -- the best start to a year since 2010.\n\nRelated: Meet South Africa's first black female winemaker\n\nNigeria\n\nAfrica's largest economy is buckling under the low oil price.\n\nNigeria relies on oil for 70% of government revenue and accounts for 90% of export revenue. That leaves very little room to adjust the country's budget. For an emerging market that can only mean one thing -- slower growth.\n\nThe West African nation is expected to clock in growth of 2.3%, the lowest rate in 15 years, according to the IMF. Its facing a shortfall of $11 billion in its 2016 budget.\n\nDiscussions between Nigeria and the World Bank are continuing on a possible loan or credit facility that would be tied to policy reforms.\n\nRelated: Nigeria cuts 23,000 'ghost workers' from government payroll\n\nIt has drawn down its currency reserves and implemented capital controls, making access to dollars very difficult. In an economy that relies on imports, the controls have made life difficult for companies and two South African businesses have already pulled out.\n\nIndex compiler MSCI is considering removing Nigeria from its frontier market index because the restrictions have made it harder for investors to repatriate money.\n\nTo make matters worse, the country is facing a fuel crisis. Despite being Africa's largest oil producer, it has never had enough refining capacity, and the scarcity of dollars is making it harder for importers to bring gas into the country.\n\nThe war against Al-Qaeda linked terror group Boko Haram, which the government has vowed to eradicate, is placing further strain on the country's finances.\n\nRelated: Your favorite brands are launching in Africa\n\nAngola\n\nWhat was once one of Africa's fastest growing economies is now on its knees and asking for help from the IMF. Angola is Africa's second largest oil producer and relies on oil for 95% of government revenue.\n\nAfter debuting on the international debt market last year, the country appears unable to meet its budget and debt obligations. It has requested assistance from the IMF in the form of monetary support.\n\nAngola is also bound to money-for-oil deals with China.

Along the way, he eviscerated the GOP's most accomplished presidential field in a generation and captured the Zeitgeist of a party in which grass roots voters harbor deep ill will toward establishment elites.\n\nThen-Senate Republican Candidate and Texas Solicitor General Cruz speaks during the Republican National Convention in 2012.\n\nThen-Senate Republican Candidate and Texas Solicitor General Cruz speaks during the Republican National Convention in 2012.\n\nThen-Senate Republican Candidate and Texas Solicitor General Cruz speaks during the Republican National Convention at the Tampa Bay Times Forum on August 28, 2012.\n\nThen-Senate Republican Candidate and Texas Solicitor General Cruz speaks during the Republican National Convention at the Tampa Bay Times Forum on August 28, 2012.\n\nThen-Senate Republican Candidate and Texas Solicitor General Cruz speaks at the 'Patriots for Romney-Ryan Reception' on August 29, 2012, in Tampa, Florida.\n\nThen-Senate Republican Candidate and Texas Solicitor General Cruz speaks at the 'Patriots for Romney-Ryan Reception' on August 29, 2012, in Tampa, Florida.\n\nCruz speaks at the CPAC on March 6, 2014, in National Harbor, Maryland.\n\nCruz speaks at the CPAC on March 6, 2014, in National Harbor, Maryland.\n\nCruz holds a news conference to announce the plan to defund Obamacare on March 13, 2013.\n\nCruz holds a news conference to announce the plan to defund Obamacare on March 13, 2013.\n\nCruz listens to testimony during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on April 22, 2013, in Washington, D.C.\n\nCruz listens to testimony during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on April 22, 2013, in Washington, D.C.\n\nCruz speaks as then-Rep.

Ted Cruz, a Republican presidential candidate, speaks during a campaign rally at the Indiana State Fairgrounds on Monday, May 2.\n\n\"It is a beautiful thing to watch, and a beautiful thing to behold,\" Trump said during a victory speech. \"We are going to make America great again.\"\n\nCruz tried everything to pull off a last-ditch win in Indiana, including the unusual move of selecting Carly Fiorina as his running mate even though he wasn't the nominee. He also forged a pact with John Kasich that would allow him to focus on Indiana while the Ohio governor would devote his time to later states.\n\nBut none of the moves worked.\n\n\"We left it all on the field in Indiana. We gave it everything we've got but the voters chose another path,\" Cruz said. \"So with a heavy heart but with boundless optimism for the long-term future of our nation, we are suspending our campaign.\"\n\n.@realDonaldTrump will be presumptive @GOP nominee, we all need to unite and focus on defeating @HillaryClinton #NeverClinton — Reince Priebus (@Reince) May 4, 2016\n\nWith 97% of the vote in at nearly 12 a.m. ET, Trump was in the lead with 53.2% while Cruz was at 36.7%. Kasich was at 7.6%.\n\nFollowing Cruz's speech, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted Trump is now the presumptive nominee and encouraged the party to \"unite and focus on defeating\" Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump paid tribute to Cruz in an effort to bring the party together.\n\n\"He is one tough competitor,\" Trump said. \"He is a smart tough guy.\"\n\nTrump quickly turned his fire on Clinton, saying she would be a \"poor president.\" He also said she \"doesn't understand trade\" and lashed out at the \"deep carnage\" he said had been wrought by the North American Free Trade Agreement that was ratified during the presidency of her husband, Bill Clinton.\n\nBut the Clinton camp quickly hit back, signaling that with Trump's ascension to presumptive nominee status, the tone of the 2016 race has changed.\n\nCampaign chairman John Podesta issued a statement saying that Trump would be a \"risky choice\" for president, saying he was neither prepared to keep Americans safe nor to help working families get ahead. \"Donald Trump has demonstrated that he's too divisive and lacks the temperament to lead our nation and the free world,\" Podesta said.\n\n\"While Donald Trump seeks to bully and divide Americans, Hillary Clinton will unite us to create an economy that works for everyone.\"\n\nGalvanizing the GOP\n\nTrump's candidacy has galvanized the GOP, bringing in voters -- especially in regions like the Rust Belt -- that might not otherwise be attracted to the party's message. In the process, he's toppled a GOP field that, at the start, included many well-respected governors and senators.\n\nGOP elites now face the long-feared reality of Trump as an outsider nominee who will lead them into the fall campaign after splitting the party, overturning establishment and conservative power bases and alienating key general election voters with incendiary rhetoric.\n\nPhotos: The Donald Trump guide to the rest of world Photos: The Donald Trump guide to the rest of world The Donald Trump travel guide – Donald Trump is truly a man of the world, even if the world doesn't always see it that way.

Hide Caption 10 of 10\n\nThe anti-Trump movement said it would fight on as Trump was still short of the delegates needed to secure the nomination. Katie Packer, the chair of Our Principles PAC, said there is still time for Trump to \"continue to disqualify himself in the eyes of voters.\"\n\n\"We continue to give voice to the belief of so many Republicans that Trump is not a conservative, does not represent the values of the Republican Party, cannot beat Hillary Clinton, and is simply unfit to be President of the United States,\" she said in a statement.\n\nFor his part, Kasich insisted he would remain in the race.\n\n\"Tonight's results are not going to alter Gov. Kasich's campaign plans,\" said John Weaver, Kasich's chief strategist. \"Our strategy has been and continues to be one that involves winning the nomination at an open convention.\"\n\nBy 9:30 p.m. ET, Trump picked up 51 delegates from Indiana, bringing him to 1,053. Cruz had 572.\n\nSanders wins Indiana\n\nMeanwhile, Bernie Sanders won the Indiana Democratic primary, a victory that will boost his campaign's morale but do little to cut deeply into Clinton's lead of nearly 300 pledged delegates. With 93% of the vote counted, Sanders had won 42 pledged delegates in Indiana and Clinton will win 36. Seven superdelegates in the state have already declared for Clinton.\n\nBut Sanders vowed to fight on, even though he admitted that the path he had was a \"narrow\" one and relied on convincing Democratic superdelegates -- party officials and lawmakers -- to back him and not Clinton.\n\n\"The Clinton campaign, a lot of the media, had decided the campaign was over,\" Sanders told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview. \"Apparently, the people of Indiana did not quite agree with that,\" Sanders said.\n\nSanders said he had \"a shot\" to win upcoming primaries in West Virginia, Oregon and Kentucky and argued his new momentum means that even if Clinton's victory is now seen by many Democrats as inevitable, she is hardly enjoying the triumphant march to the finish line that she hoped for.\n\nSanders also challenged Clinton, who would prefer to be turning her attention to Trump, to agree to a debate in California before the state's delegate-rich primary on June 7.\n\nBut the main focus of Tuesday night was the Republican race -- and a remarkable change of mood from Trump's camp after a day in which he and Cruz had swapped some of their most vehement attacks of the campaign.\n\nCruz, facing the prospect of an Indiana defeat, snapped after weeks of personal attacks from Trump that included fresh insinuations that his father was associated with Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\n\"I'm going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump,\" he told reporters at a morning news conference.\n\nCruz blasted Trump as a \"pathological liar,\" \"utterly amoral,\" \"a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen\" and \"a serial philanderer.\"\n\nHe unleashed his full arsenal of insults in his attack on Trump.\n\n\"He is proud of being a serial philanderer ... he describes his own battles with venereal diseases as his own personal Vietnam,\" Cruz said, citing a decades-old Trump appearance on \"The Howard Stern Show.\"\n\n\"This man is a pathological liar, he doesn't know the difference between truth and lies ... in a pattern that is straight out of a psychology textbook, he accuses everyone of lying,\" Cruz said as Indiana voters headed to cast their ballots. \"Whatever lie he's telling, at that minute he believes it ... the man is utterly immoral,\" Cruz said.\n\nTrump hit back in a statement blasting Cruz as a \"desperate candidate trying to save his failing campaign.\"\n\nThe volley reflected the increasingly personal battle between Cruz and Trump in the final days of the Indiana contest. Earlier Tuesday, Trump had criticized Rafael Cruz, the senator's father, calling him \"disgraceful\" after he urged evangelical voters in Indiana to reject his son's rival.\n\nTrump also referenced a report from the tabloid National Enquirer -- without naming the publication -- which alleged that it had identified Rafael Cruz in a photo with Lee Harvey Oswald months prior to the JFK assassination. CNN has not independently confirmed that report -- and there is no evidence that it is true.\n\n\"And (Ted Cruz's) father, you know, was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's, you know, being shot. I mean the whole thing is ridiculous,\" Trump said in an interview on \"Fox and Friends.\" \"I mean what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald, shortly before the death? Before the shooting? It's horrible.\"",

        "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump walked out of discussions to end a partial government shutdown, now in its third week, calling the talks with congressional Democrats \"a total waste of time.\"\n\n\"Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!\" Trump said.\n\nJust left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!\n\nTop congressional Democrats blasted Trump after the meeting Wednesday afternoon, accusing him of indifference to struggling federal workers and not trying to negotiate as the government shutdown drags on.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the President just got up and walked out,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. \"He asked Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi, 'Will you agree to my wall?' She said no. And he just got up and said, 'Then we have nothing to discuss,' and he just walked out. Again, we saw a temper tantrum because he couldn't get his way, and he just walked out of the meeting.\"\n\nMeeting sours after candy\n\nTrump was in a chummy mood when he entered the Situation Room, according to a source familiar with how things unfolded. The President passed out candy to attendees -- Butterfinger and Baby Ruth bars as well as M&M's.\n\nTrump told congressional leaders they would find a letter at each of their chairs -- a copy of the budget request the Office of Management and Budget had put together for congressional staff in Sunday's meeting that laid out the administration's shutdown priorities.\n\nThen, with the letters stating their position in front of them, White House officials asked Democrats where their position stood.\n\nPelosi informed the President she was concerned about ports of entry, something which he agreed with. Trump said there was money allotted in the administration's priority list that beefed up the ports of entry. But Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, also seated at the table, interjected to say that even if the ports of entry eliminated all drug smuggling, smugglers would find another way in, which is why the barrier structure is important, sparking the most heated exchange of the meeting between Pelosi and Trump.\n\nSchumer jumped in to stress the importance of opening up the government and then negotiating on border security funding from there.\n\nHe at one point asked Trump, \"Why won't you open the government and stop hurting people?\"\n\nTrump responded bluntly, \"Because then you won't give me what I want.\"\n\nA White House official disputes that the President replied with those words. The official claims that Trump answered, \"I gotta get you to do the right thing.\"\n\nTrump then asked Democrats whether, if he opened up the parts of the government that are shut down, Pelosi would be willing to build a barrier. She declined.\n\nA source familiar with what happened inside the room said Trump ended the meeting by standing up and announcing \"bye-bye\" before turning and walking out.\n\nAfter Trump left the room, Pelosi and Schumer got up to leave. Vice President Mike Pence then asked for a counteroffer from Democrats -- asking what they are willing to work on, so the White House would have a better idea to move forward. They didn't offer one, something that has frustrated White House officials since they first privately offered less than $5.6 billion the day after the government shut down.\n\nImmigration proposal considered\n\nStaring at a prolonged shutdown, Republican senators are privately planning to court Democratic senators on an immigration deal that would give Trump money for his border wall and include several measures long-sought by Democrats, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nFollowing Trump's meeting, GOP senators privately gathered in Sen. Lindsey Graham's office Wednesday to discuss a way out of the logjam. The long-shot idea: propose an immigration deal that would include money for the wall along with several provisions that could entice Democrats. Those items include changes to help those who are a part of the Deferred Action Childhood Arrival program as well as immigrants from El Salvador and other countries impacted by the Temporary Protected Status program -- as well as modifications to H2B visas.\n\nGOP senators pitched the idea to senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, who said if they came up with a proposal that got Trump his border wall money and could pass the Senate, the White House would be open to more discussions on the matter, the source said. He did not say Trump would endorse such a plan.\n\nThe GOP senators -- who include Graham of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Rob Portman of Ohio and Lisa Murkowksi of Alaska -- discussed the plan in a hastily arranged meeting Wednesday, with several of them now planning to propose the idea to Democrats to see if there's a enough support to break the logjam.\n\nBreakdown in talks leads to fiery rhetoric\n\nA White House official says no other meeting with Pelosi has been scheduled at this time, and a national emergency declaration is still on the table.\n\nThe meeting at the White House came just hours before the House of Representatives was expected to vote on individual bills to help reopen the government . The bills aren't expected to go anywhere in the GOP-controlled Senate at this time but the maneuver is aimed at putting pressure on Republicans. Trump promised earlier Wednesday to veto that legislation if it reached his desk.\n\nPelosi, speaking alongside Schumer outside the White House, said Trump was \"insensitive\" to federal workers missing pay during the shutdown and alluded to Trump's own privileged upbringing.\n\n\"He thinks maybe they could just ask their father for money, but they can't,\" the California Democrat said.\n\nShe added, \"If you don't understand financial insecurity then you would have a policy that takes pride in saying, 'I'm going to keep government shut down for months or years unless you totally agree to my position.' \"\n\nSen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate's number two Democrat, said after the meeting that \"it was pretty clear\" Trump's heart was not in it.\n\n\"He said today, in the middle of this meeting, 'I don't know why I'm doing this. I didn't want to do this meeting. They told me I had to do this meeting,' \" Durbin said.\n\nTop Republicans spoke to the media after the Democratic statements and took issue with their characterization of the meeting, though they did not dispute that Trump left the meeting. Among them were Pence, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota.\n\nNotably, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, did not appear alongside them.\n\nPence said Trump told the Democrats \"goodbye\" after Pelosi denied his request for a wall, and the vice president contended the move made clear that Trump would not end the shutdown without his border measures.\n\n\"What the President made clear today is he is going to stand firm to achieve his priorities to build a wall, a steel barrier on the southern border, add additional personnel, additional resources, additional reforms to stem the crisis that we face on our southern border,\" Pence said.\n\nMcCarthy said Trump had gone back and forth with Pelosi and Schumer, and then eventually asked Pelosi, \" 'OK, Nancy, if we open the government up in 30 days, could we have border security?' \"\n\n\"She raised her hand and said, 'No, not at all,' \" McCarthy recalled. \"The President calmly said, 'I guess you're still not wanting to deal with the problem.' \"\n\nWednesday's meeting came a day after Trump delivered an Oval Office address standing by his demand for Congress to fund his border wall with Mexico and Democrats continued to refuse the request. With no apparent end in sight to the disagreement, the shutdown was due to enter its 20th day.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.",

Chuck Grassley, filled in for the majority leader by carrying out some procedural duties on the floor, including taking steps to put a bill up that would \"prohibit taxpayer funded abortions,\" in the words of a Senate clerk who read the title of the bill.\n\nWhen Grassley, who is a Trump ally, left the chamber, he told CNN's Manu Raju he opposes the President declaring a national emergency and bypassing Congress to build the wall, as he has threatened to do to get around the stalled talked with Democrats. Such a move, could end the shutdown.\n\nVirginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine then read aloud from missives from constituents who are terrified about missing paychecks and worried a lengthy shutdown could cause them lasting economic damage.\n\nKaine said that furloughed workers are actually receiving paychecks Friday, but they have nothing but zeros on them, \"which is sort of like pouring salt in a wound,\" he said.\n\nIn a twist, Kaine praised McConnell for passing a bill on the Senate floor Thursday, to ensure furloughed workers will get back pay once the shutdown is over.\n\n\"I do want to express appreciation to the Majority Leader,\" Kaine said. \"I applaud him for reaching out to the White House and speaking directly with the President about the bill. And the President indicated he would sign it.\"\n\nThe truth is McConnell is a \"regular order\" Republican who opposed the shutdown from the start and worked hard to avoid it. He was as surprised as anyone when Trump suddenly announced at the end of last year that he would not sign bills to keep to government, as leverage to get Democrats to fund the border wall.\n\nBut he knows that only three members of his caucus have split publicly with Trump's demands for the wall, so he doesn't have much incentive to push back, even if he wanted to. In numerous speeches, McConnell has talked tough about the needs for stronger borders -- firmly backing Trump on one of his top policy goals -- and accused Democrats of changing their past positions in favor of more border security to spite Trump.\n\nThat said, McConnell has taken a lower public profile in some instances since the shutdown started, and he demanded Democrats and Trump work out an agreement without his involvement. He skipped a couple of White House news conferences that were attended by other GOP congressional leaders although he did appear before cameras this week with Trump after the President met with Senate Republicans in the Capitol.\n\nAsked if McConnell had missed an opportunity when he didn't show Friday, Sen. John Boozman, a soft-spoken Republican from Arkansas, defended his leader.\n\n\"I think he represents the caucus well and whatever he's doing, he has reasons for doing,\" said Boozman, who presided over the Senate. \"I haven't talked to him about what his schedule is.\"\n\nDemocratic Leader Chuck Schumer also wasn't in the Senate on Friday, he was home in New York, according to his office. And while he doesn't have the power to schedule votes on bills that would open the government, he does have to power to continue talks with the White House, and there were no signs that happened either.\n\nMcConnell spokesman Don Stewart told CNN that Democrats \"have refused to move an inch. So, there is not yet a negotiated agreement to vote on. At some point, senators like Kaine and Van Hollen will stand up to their leadership and demand that they negotiate. But for now, it seems clear that all they want to do is give speeches. The Senate can't vote on a speech.\"\n\nThe lone Republican to address the shutdown on the floor was Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, one of the three GOP senators opposed to the shutdown. She spoke about the need for strong borders and resolving the humanitarian crisis at the southern border, and for reopening the government.\n\n\"Count me in as one who says that shutting down the government is not governing. Nobody is winning in this,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked by CNN about her thoughts on McConnell, she declined to weigh in on whether he should be in Washington.\n\n\"The majority leader is very strategic and has been kind of behind the scenes in so much of all of this, so he is very effective with the phones and I am not going to suggest where he should or where he shouldn't be,\" Murkowski said. \"I for one and certainly wanting and desiring to be part of discussions that will lead to a solution.\"\n\nAt the end of her floor speech, Murkowski did something else usually reserved for the majority leader, if he were here.\n\n\"I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m. Monday, January 14,\" she said.\n\nAnd a short time later, as furloughed workers opened paychecks with zeros on them, the Senate gaveled out for the weekend.",

        "authors": [],
        "publisher": "www.cnn.com",
        "publish_date": "2019-05-23",
        "text": "(CNN) As President Donald Trump has been openly feuding with House Democrats pursuing investigations into him , his administration and his finances, some lawmakers are calling to start an impeachment inquiry , the first step in a lengthy and likely divisive process.\n\nThose calls have in recent weeks grown louder, though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler are so far resisting the pressure to open an impeachment inquiry after special counsel Robert Mueller announced in late May that he's closing his office and wouldn't provide any information beyond his already-released report in any appearance before Congress.\n\nImpeachment appears politically risky for Democrats for many reasons, not least of which is that even if the House could get a majority to support impeachment, it likely would go nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate. That said, that calculation is not stopping some Democrats from pushing for the maneuver, particularly following a series of efforts by Trump and his White House not to comply with the requests of the House investigations.\n\nWhile there are varying degrees of how far critics of the President are willing to push the process, one relatively basic litmus test is whether lawmakers would support starting an impeachment inquiry, the first significant step in the process.\n\nOf the 235 Democrats in the House, there are at least 82 -- according to a CNN count -- who've made public comments advocating at least for starting the impeachment inquiry process, while some have gone further.\n\nOn the Republican side, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan has also called for impeachment proceedings, bringing the total number of representatives to 83.\n\nHouse Democrats who have publicly stated they at least support starting an impeachment inquiry:\n\n1. Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island\n\nIn advance of former White House counsel Don McGahn declining to show up for the House Judiciary Committee in May, Cicilline said the \"time has come\" for an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"The White House and the President have attempted to impede our ability to get to the truth ... we have a responsibility at some point to open up an inquiry if this kind of obstruction, interference and stonewalling continues,\" Cicilline told reporters.\n\n2. Rep. Ted Lieu of California\n\nLieu spoke on CNN in May and said that while he didn't support full impeachment, he was among those Democrats supporting starting an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"Let me just be very clear,\" Lieu told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \"Democrats are not saying impeachment. What I'm saying and what some others are saying is an impeachment inquiry, which is, we have to start these investigations to see if we should do impeachment.\"\n\nWhen Blitzer followed to clarify if Lieu supported \"beginning impeachment procedures\" but not full impeachment, Lieu responded \"That is correct. Because we need to build a record in these committees.\"\n\n3. Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington\n\nJayapal spoke on CNN in May and tweeted , \"I joined @wolfblitzer to discuss how @HouseJudiciary will hold this President and his administration accountable. Judge Mehta's decision was important - but we still have to do our jobs and uphold the Constitution. For me, that means pursuing an impeachment inquiry.\"\n\n4. Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas\n\nEscobar was among lawmakers who pushed in May for Pelosi and Nadler to take a more aggressive stance than they're currently taking and start an impeachment inquiry.\n\nShe also tweeted , \"I believe we need to begin an impeachment inquiry.\"\n\n5. Rep. Val Demings of Florida\n\nDemings told CNN last month that the evidence contained in the Mueller report was sufficient for Democrats to take the next, fateful step.\n\n\"I believe it's pretty clear that the President made numerous attempts to obstruct justice or obstructed justice,\" Demings, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"The Lead.\"\n\n\"And so I believe, based on that information, as I did a month ago, that we have enough to begin those proceedings.\"\n\n6. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas\n\nJackson Lee, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told reporters in May that she planned to introduce \"a resolution of investigation\" that will call on the House Judiciary Committee to investigate whether there is \"sufficient grounds\" to move forward with impeachment.\n\n7. Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky\n\nYarmuth, who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, told reporters in May, \"I think it's time\" to begin the proceedings. On CNN, he said he's not alone.\n\n\"I think what we have, John, is we have a situation in which I think a growing majority of our caucus believes that impeachment is going to be inevitable,\" Yarmuth told CNN's John Berman on \"New Day .\" \"But they also believe that we need to pursue the investigations that are going on to make sure that certain conduct of the administration and the President that they need to be held accountable for is discovered.\"\n\n8. Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee\n\nCohen, who is a member of the House Judiciary Committee, has long been a proponent of impeachment and introduced articles of impeachment against Trump in November 2017.\n\n\"The time has come to make clear to the American people and to this President that his train of injuries to our Constitution must be brought to an end through impeachment,\" Cohen said in a statement at the time . \"I believe there is evidence that he attempted to obstruct an investigation into Russia's interference with the U.S. presidential election and links between between Russia and the Trump campaign, most notably the firing of FBI Director James Comey.\"\n\n9. Rep. Al Green of Texas\n\nGreen was the first House Democrat to formally seek Trump's impeachment from the House floor in comments he made in May 2017.\n\n\"This is about my position. This is about what I believe. And this is where I stand. I will not be moved. The President must be impeached,\" Green said at the time . \"For those who do not know, impeachment does not mean that the President would be found guilty. It simply means that the House of Representatives will bring charges against the President. It's similar to an indictment but not quite the same thing.\"\n\n10. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York\n\nIn a series of tweets, Ocasio-Cortez said that she will be signing on to an impeachment resolution led by fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, following the release of the special counsel Robert Mueller's report in April.\n\n\"Mueller's report is clear in pointing to Congress' responsibility in investigating obstruction of justice by the President. It is our job as outlined in Article 1, Sec 2, Clause 5 of the US Constitution. As such, I'll be signing onto @RashidaTlaib's impeachment resolution,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on April 18.\n\n11. Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas\n\nCastro, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN in May that it's time to begin an impeachment inquiry immediately given the White House stonewalling of Congress' oversight.\n\n12. Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia\n\nBeyer announced in May his support for starting an impeachment inquiry in a statement.\n\n\"The time has come for the House of Representatives to open an impeachment inquiry into the conduct of President Trump,\" Beyer said. \"Endorsing such a course is not easy, and I do not do so lightly, but I believe that the President has left Congress no other option but to pursue it.\n\n13. Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado\n\nNeguse tweeted last month \"The findings detailed in the Special Counsel's report, and the Administration's pattern of wholesale obstruction of Congress since the report's release, make clear that it is time to open an impeachment inquiry.\"\n\n14. Rep. Jackie Speier of California\n\nSpeier told CNN's \"New Day\" in May that she supported starting the impeachment inquiry process.\n\n\"I believe that an inquiry into impeachment is required at this time,\" Speier said.\n\n15. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland\n\nRaskin, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, was among the Democrats who asked Pelosi at a meeting in May about pursuing an impeachment inquiry.\n\nRaskin told CNN the following day, \"I would totally support opening an impeachment inquiry at this point.\"\n\n16. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania\n\nScanlon, a member of the Judiciary Committee, tweeted in May that she supported an impeachment inquiry after a text message conversation with her son.\n\n17. Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado\n\n\"The Mueller report details many instances in which President Trump actively attempted to interfere with the investigation into his campaign's potentially treasonous ties with Russia,\" she stated. \"The President's actions are clearly beneath the high personal, ethical and legal standards our founders envisioned in the executive branch, and, as such, constitute a prima facie case to trigger an impeachment investigation.\"\n\n18. Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin\n\nPocan released a statement supporting starting an impeachment inquiry in May.\n\n\"Stonewalling Congress on witnesses and the unredacted Mueller report only enhances the President's appearance of guilt, and as a result, he has pushed Congress to a point where we must start an impeachment inquiry,\" Pocan said.\n\n19. Rep. Earl Blumenauer of Oregon\n\nBlumenauer released a statement in early May backing the start of an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"The Mueller investigation was limited in its capacity to take action and draw conclusions due to Justice Department guidelines,\" he wrote. \"Yet, it was a treasure trove of information that deserves further investigation, which should be done in the House—the only chamber willing to hold this president accountable. For that reason, I am joining Congresswoman Tlaib in calling for the Judiciary Committee to carry out a formal investigation regarding potential impeachable offenses by Donald Trump.\"\n\n20. Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania\n\nDean, a member of the Judiciary Committee, told CNN in an interview in May that she supported starting an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"We can't just constantly put out lawful subpoena, try to do our constitutional oversight, be stonewalled by an administration that's just simply trying to cover up bad behaviors, and not change course,\" Dean said. \"And so what we've been trying to do is investigative oversight. I believe at the point you have Barr fail to come forward and produce documents, you have McGahn fail to produce documents and come forward, enough's enough. It's time to begin an investigation, an inquiry, as to impeachment.\"\n\n21. Rep. Dwight Evans of Pennsylvania\n\nEvans has openly supported steps toward impeachment since Trump's first year in office. In December 2017, he released a statement explaining his vote not to table a House resolution calling for impeachment\n\n\"After being in Congress for over a year and observing President Trump's questionable actions I strongly believe there should at least be a discussion about whether or not President Trump's actions met the bar of impeachment,\" Evans stated.\n\nIn February 2018, Evans was co-host of an event on the \"Party to Impeach\" tour with billionaire Tom Steyer, who has long publicly advocated impeaching Trump.\n\n\"The President is not above the Constitution,\" Evans told Philly Magazine at the time . \"He needs to be held accountable. My constituents have raised serious concerns about the President's actions.\"\n\n22. Rep. Jared Huffman of California\n\nHuffman signed on to efforts to start impeachment proceedings in December 2017.\n\n\"Impeachment is an extraordinary measure, but it should be clear to anyone who examines the facts that President Trump's actions justify his impeachment, including his efforts to obstruct justice, his self-enrichment and serial violations of the Emoluments Clause, and his involvement in a cover-up stemming from his campaign's very likely collusion with Russian interests to undermine the 2016 presidential election,\" Huffman said in a statement at the time.\n\n23. Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts\n\nMoulton, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president, said earlier this year that he supported moving forward with impeachment proceedings.\n\n\"I voted on this a over a year ago, and I said that proceedings should move forward,\" he told reporters at a campaign stop on April 23 in Manchester, New Hampshire.\n\nMoulton was careful to note \"it's not the right time to vote on impeachment, because we don't have all the facts in, we don't even have the full version of the Mueller report, but we absolutely should move forward on the proceedings, so we can have this debate in Congress, and frankly I think it's long overdue.\"\n\n24. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota\n\nOmar has called for some form of impeachment proceedings against Trump since before she was sworn in to Congress in January.\n\n\"We know that this President, this administration every day has gone a little bit closer to being impeached. ... We won't be having these conversations on whether to do it, but it's going to be when and how,\" Omar told CNN in December.\n\nMore recently she's signed petitions to start impeachment proceedings, as well as signing on to Tlaib's impeachment resolution in April.\n\n25. Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts\n\nPressley was among those lawmakers who signed on to Tlaib's impeachment resolution following the release of the redacted Mueller report.\n\n\"That resolution will come before a vote before the Congress and it asks that, dependent on that vote, that we follow up procedurally in committee,\" Pressley told Boston Public Radio on April 19 . \"I mean here's the thing — I have felt for a long time that this administration has lost all moral authority and there are many impeachable offenses.\"\n\n26. Rep. Kathleen Rice of New York\n\nRice tweeted in April that Congress should start impeachment proceedings.\n\n\"For over two years the President has systematically dismantled our democracy and defied the rule of law. This cannot stand,\" she tweeted . \"Congress has a moral obligation to put our politics aside and take action. We need to start impeachment proceedings.\"\n\n27. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan\n\nOn the night of her swearing in in Congress, Tlaib made headlines when she told a crowd: \"We're going to impeach the motherf****r.\" She's since authored her own resolution to start impeachment proceedings.\n\n28. Rep. Filemon Vela of Texas\n\nVela tweeted in August 2018 that \"we must impeach crooked Donnie,\" following news of a guilty verdict for Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nVela also signed on to Tlaib's impeachment resolution on April 30.\n\n29. Rep. Maxine Waters of California\n\nWaters, the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, has long called for starting the process of impeachment for the President.\n\n\"When are the people of this country going to wake up to the fact that this president is a disgusting liar, documented to have lied over 8,000 times in 2 yrs? Add to that his recent, blatant lies on our nation's intel chiefs' testimony in the US Senate. Past time for impeachment!\" she tweeted in January.\n\n30. Rep. Brad Sherman of California\n\nSherman was among the earliest advocates for impeachment, signing on to a resolution with Green in July 2017.\n\n\"Recent disclosures by Donald Trump Jr. indicate that Trump's campaign was eager to receive assistance from Russia,\" Sherman said in a statement at the time. \"It now seems likely that the President had something to hide when he tried to curtail the investigation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and the wider Russian probe. I believe his conversations with, and subsequent firing of, FBI Director James Comey constitute Obstruction of Justice.\"\n\n31. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon\n\nBonamici released a statement in May supporting the start of an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"I am gravely concerned about the actions of President Trump and the growing evidence of possible impeachable offenses, including obstruction of justice, committing human rights violations by separating children from their families, and profiting from the presidency,\" Bonamici said in the statement. \"I've said before that impeachment should be an option, but we must approach it deliberately. The time has come.\"\n\n32. Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio\n\nFudge has long been a supporter of starting impeachment proceedings against Trump. In November 2017, she joined Cohen's introduction of articles of impeachment\n\n\"In the nearly 300 days since he was sworn in, it has become evident that President Trump is a clear and present danger to our democracy. It is high time that Congress take a serious look at the President's actions,\" Fudge said in a statement from Cohen's office. \"If those actions are found to be in violation of the Constitution, then the Congress of the United States needs to do the job the American people elected us to do.\"\n\n33. Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin\n\nMoore has long said she supports starting impeachment proceedings, telling local reporters in her home district in August 2017, \"Yeah, I think so. I think I'm there,\" when asked by WISN-12 if she wanted to see Trump impeached.\n\nShe also tweeted in August 2017 , \"My Republican friends, I implore you to work w/ us within our capacity as elected officials to remove @realDonaldTrump as #POTUS. #Impeach45.\"\n\nMore recently, she tweeted in February that Trump declaring a national emergency to start construction on a border wall would be \"grounds for impeachment,\" a step Trump later took.\n\n34. Rep. Norma Torres of California\n\nTorres told The Washington Post in April that \"I think there is enough evidence in front of us to move forward\" on impeachment proceedings and that \"if it came up for a vote today, I would vote to impeach this president.\"\n\nIn a story headlined \"How the Mueller report convinced this House Democrat that Trump should be impeached,\" Torres said that Congress and Trump are at a \"stalemate\" and not able to focus on the issues.\n\n\"This president took an oath of office to uphold the Constitution, and he's violated that,\" Torres told the Post. \"He's violated the spirit of the law. We need to hold him accountable.\"\n\n35. Rep. Juan Vargas of California\n\nVargas told the NBC affiliate in San Diego in May that \"the reality is he broke the law and he should be impeached.\"\n\n36. Rep. Danny Davis of Illinois\n\nDavis said in a statement in May, before Mueller's spoke publicly: \"I believe it is time and imperative that the United States House of Representatives begin an impeachment inquiry whether the House of Representatives should impeach Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America. To that end I will be requesting that my name be added as a co-sponsor of H. Res. 257. It is my hope that the House will move forward in as unified and non-partisan manner as possible but will not be dissuaded by purely political opposition.\"\n\n37. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi\n\nThompson, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, posted on Facebook after Mueller's remarks in late May, \"I support impeachment. The President has egregiously obstructed justice.\" His statement also cited Mueller's comment that \"if we had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.\"\n\n38. Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts\n\nMcGovern, chairman of the House Rules Committee, said on Boston radio station WGBH's podcast in May that he believed it was time to begin an impeachment inquiry: \"I believe, quite frankly, that the next step is for the House Judiciary Committee to open an inquiry to formally begin considering whether impeachment is warranted. I think we're at that point, and I think that to me seems like a logical way to proceed.\" He noted that he had backed an impeachment inquiry when the House voted on it in 2017, but said he hadn't been vocal about doing so in the current Congress until now.\n\n39. Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey\n\nMalinowski explained to the New Jersey Star-Ledger in late May why he supports moving forward with impeachment proceedings:\n\n\"Nobody knows what the political impact will be, and therefore it is a risk. But when in doubt, it's probably best to do the right thing.\"\n\n40. Rep. Adriano Espaillat of New York\n\nEspaillat explained to CNN's Poppy Harlow and Jim Sciutto why he favors impeachment, saying he felt the threshold for impeachment was met \"some time\" ago over the emoluments issue.\n\n\"We must, as duly elected members of Congress, exercise our duties entrusted by the Constitution of the United States,\" he said in late May, the day after Mueller's public remarks.\n\n41. Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania\n\nIn an interview in May with CNN's Kate Bolduan, Boyle said he's ready to start holding impeachment hearings.\n\n\"Given that the special counsel is now officially concluded and is now resigning, I believe that the ball is clearly in our court,\" he said. \"I've called not for a rush to vote on impeachment but the official beginning of impeachment hearings, so that way we can go through what's in the report. We can further investigate where the report didn't go.\"\n\n42. Rep. Greg Stanton of Arizona\n\nStanton, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement in May: \"It is time for the House of Representatives to move to the next stages of holding the President accountable, including the extraordinary step of opening an impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nStanton said, \"This is a conclusion I reached only recently, and not one I reached lightly.\"\n\n43. Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois\n\n\"I notified the speaker's office today ... now asking that we open an inquiry,\" he said.\n\n44. Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota\n\nIn an interview in May with CNN's Erin Burnett on \"OutFront,\" McCollum explained why she is in favor of impeachment.\n\n\"We have every right to get to the truth because the President is not above the law, so we need to be able to do our work,\" McCollum said, adding, \"That is why many of us are saying that we have to look at impeachment because (Trump) has snubbed his nose at Congress being able to do its job to the regular subpoena power.\"\n\n45. Rep. G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina\n\n\"The evidence that has been produced so far is sufficient in my opinion to support an impeachment inquiry and impeachment and removal,\" Butterfield told McClatchy in May. \"I am prepared to vote for an impeachment inquiry ... and I will vote for impeachment and removal.\"\n\n46. Rep. Mark DeSaulnier of California\n\nDeSaulnier put out a statement late in late May after Mueller's public remarks, saying, \"Congress must do its job, which includes overriding the DOJ policy that protects the president under any circumstance, and beginning an impeachment inquiry.\"\n\n47. Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona\n\nGrijalva tweeted last month after Mueller's statement: \"President Trump is not exonerated, and his administration is deliberately misleading the American people about the findings of the Special Counsel. If this isn't a reason for an #ImpeachmentInquiryNow, I don't know what is.\"\n\n48. Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana\n\nRichmond, a member of the House Judiciary Committee and a former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, supports starting an impeachment inquiry, the lawmaker's congressional office confirmed to CNN in May.\n\n49. Rep. Alan Lowenthal of California\n\nLowenthal tweeted last month, \"Special Counsel Mueller's statement yesterday highlighted what was clear in his report. Our democracy was attacked by a foreign power, and there is evidence that the president obstructed justice. Congress must hold him accountable. I believe the time has come to consider an impeachment inquiry.\"\n\n50. Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois\n\nRush believes that Trump should be impeached, his office told CNN in May.\n\n\"Congress has a responsibility to protect the Constitutional foundation of our government with respect for the laws of this great nation. We must not forget that no one is above the law. Otherwise, we are destined to be a nation of well-intentioned individuals instead of law-abiding citizens,\" Rush said in a statement.\n\n51. Rep. Barbara Lee of California\n\nLee is a cosponsor of Tlaib's impeachment inquiry resolution.\n\n52. Rep. Alma Adams of North Carolina\n\nAdams released a statement in late May: \"The President has demonstrated a clear disregard for the rule of law and he must be held accountable. Impeachment is not off the table. However, before we move forward the American people deserve all the facts. That is why I support an impeachment inquiry. Congress has a sacred responsibility to obtain the information necessary to determine the next steps.\"\n\n53. Rep. Yvette Clarke of New York\n\nClarke tweeted in May: \"We have to remove @realDonaldTrump from the White House as soon as possible. #Impeach45\"\n\n54. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio\n\nRyan, who's running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said at a CNN town hall in early June that it was time \"to move forward with the impeachment process.\"\n\n\"I have read the Mueller Report, and I believe he obstructed on multiple occasions,\" he added. \"We have a responsibility. I don't want to, I know what this is going to do to the country. I take no joy in this at all. But I have a duty and a responsibility and that duty and responsibility has led me to think that we have to do this.\"\n\n55. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine\n\nPingree tweeted in late May: \"The Mueller Report and the Special Counsel's statement was a turning point. It's time for Congress to begin an impeachment inquiry.\"\n\n56. Rep. Nanette Barragán of California\n\nBarragán said in a statement in June: \"Robert Mueller made clear that he did not exonerate the President and it is up to Congress to hold the President accountable through oversight and impeachment. Given the Special Counsel's report, his statement last week and the President's ongoing efforts to block any oversight and investigation by Congress, I support an impeachment inquiry. No one is above the law and Congress has a constitutional duty to act.\"\n\n57. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas\n\nDoggett's office confirmed in a June 3 statement from the lawmaker to CNN that the Texas Democrat supports starting an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"What Mueller thought he could not do, Congress can no longer avoid,\" Doggett said in the statement.\n\n58. Rep. Paul Tonko of New York\n\nOn June 3, Tonko sent a series of tweets explaining why he supported starting an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"After careful review of the evidence and testimony currently available, and in service to my oath, it is my judgment that Congress needs to accept the baton being handed to us by now former Special Counsel Mueller ... and open an impeachment inquiry to more fully assess the Constitutional implications of seemingly criminal actions by the President and his campaign, and to determine whether formal impeachment charges need to be filed,\" Tonko wrote in two of those tweets\n\n59. Rep. Jesús \"Chuy\" García of Illinois\n\nGarcía's office released a statement in late May announcing his support for starting an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"After careful deliberation, I have concluded that the House of Representatives must begin a formal impeachment inquiry to fulfill our constitutionally mandated responsibility to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,\" García said.\n\n60. Rep. Brenda Lawrence of Michigan\n\n\"You know, we've been talking about impeachment. Few people understand that if we impeach him -- and I feel that we should begin that process -- if we impeach him, he still is sitting in the White House because the Senate has to act,\" Lawrence said.\n\n61. Rep. Eric Swalwell of California\n\nSwalwell, who is among the Democratic House members running for president, called for an impeachment inquiry to be opened on June 13, following comments Trump made about being willing to accept damaging information on a political opponent from a foreign actor and not report it to the FBI.\n\n\"Impeachment is the most extraordinary remedy the Constitution affords Congress,\" Swalwell told reporters. \"As a former prosecutor, I do not take this lightly. But the President continues to put his own interests above America's. He is lawless. His relentless attacks on our rule of law and numerous efforts to obstruct justice and Congress have reached such a point to require extraordinary action. It's time for Congress to open an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\"\n\n62. Rep. Dan Kildee of Michigan\n\nKildee, who is chief deputy whip of the House Democratic Caucus, said on June 14 that actions described in the Mueller report and the administration's stonewalling of congressional oversight have led him to \"no other choice.\"\n\n\"I have been reluctant to use the tool of impeachment, and have always viewed impeachment as a tool of last resort,\" Kildee said in a statement. \"But the President's actions have taken us to a moment where I believe Congress must open an impeachment inquiry to defend the rule of law.\"\n\n63. Rep. Andy Levin of Michigan\n\nLevin tweeted in June that he was backing impeachment after having \"watched the Trump administration's stonewalling of our oversight activities.\" Congress' appeals to the judiciary to enforce subpoenas, he said, \"follow a timeline far too slow to meet the needs of the American people for truth and justice.\"\n\n\"I have concluded that the only way to get to the bottom of Mr. Trump's activities and inform the public about what we learn is to centralize and expedite the process through one select committee with the focus, power and urgency that come with an impeachment inquiry,\" he added in another tweet.\n\nPorter, a freshman Democrat who flipped a Republican district in 2018, tweeted a video in June in which she said she supports opening an impeachment investigation into Trump.\n\n\"After weeks of study, deliberation and conversations with Orange County families, I've decided to support an impeachment investigation of the President,\" Porter said in the video.\n\n65.

Joyce Beatty of Ohio\n\nBeatty tweeted in May that she supported the start of an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"Special Counsel Robert Mueller made crystal clear that Trump was not exonerated -- in fact his report concluded the exact opposite,\" she wrote. \"That is why I support Congress continuing to use our oversight and investigative tools to get to the bottom of any wrongdoing. I ultimately believe this process will lead to an impeachment inquiry, which I would support for the people and to keep America great.\"\n\n69. Rep. Brian Higgins of New York\n\nIn June, Higgins called for an impeachment inquiry to begin.\n\n\"Obstruction of justice is an impeachable offense.

Jan Schakowsky of Illinois\n\nIn June, Schakowsky called for the House to begin an impeachment inquiry into the President.\n\n\"Today, I am announcing that I believe that the House of Representatives should begin an impeachment inquiry, officially, because President Trump certainly has committed all kinds of offenses that meet the standard of impeachment -- high crimes and misdemeanors,\" she said in a video posted to Twitter.\n\n71. Rep. Adam Smith of Washington\n\nSmith told CNN in June that he supported starting an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"I've called for an impeachment inquiry basically,\" Smith told CNN's Manu Raju. \"Look at all the issues raised by the Mueller report: obstruction and even I know he says it's not there but connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian interference.\"\n\n72.

Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania\n\nDoyle tweeted his support for an impeachment inquiry in June.\n\n\"Congress has the authority to subpoena any information necessary to carry out its oversight responsibilities,\" Doyle wrote. \"But the Administration refuses to comply with subpoenas and continues to prevent witnesses from testifying.

Jim Himes of Connecticut\n\nHimes, a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee, called for the start of an impeachment inquiry in June.\n\n\"During my career, I have learned that there are moments for calculation, prudence, compromise and the careful weighing of competing interests.

        "text": "Washington (CNN) There's a reason House Democrats haven't started impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump yet: almost none of their most vulnerable members support the move.\n\nCNN reached out to 41 freshmen Democrats who flipped Republican seats last year to ask if they currently support starting an impeachment inquiry. The results were telling -- nearly half (20) didn't respond. Of those who did, the vast majority were either a \"no\" or undecided.\n\nKnown as the \"majority makers\" or \"front-liners,\" this group was key to securing the Democrats' House majority last year. And Democratic leaders are intensely focused on holding those districts in 2020.\n\nThat gives these members enormous influence in whatever direction the party takes -- and hardly any are calling for impeachment.\n\nOf the 43 Democratic challengers who flipped seats from red to blue in 2018, only two -- Reps. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey and Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania -- have publicly said they support opening an impeachment inquiry. And only Scanlon represents a more liberal seat than her Republican predecessor due to redistricting.\n\nWhat we asked\n\nCNN asked the remaining 41 members where they stand on opening an inquiry. Of the 21 that responded, it was clear that most of them aren't on board with an impeachment push -- though many aren't entirely ruling it out.\n\nTen offices told CNN that they did not support an inquiry at this time, and by CNN's count, 11 were undecided.\n\nMany who did respond issued statements urging the House to push forward with the various investigations into Trump's campaign, administration and finances , suggesting that they could be open to starting an impeachment inquiry at a later point even if they are not calling for it now.\n\nIn what could be a tough vote for some Democrats who just want to move on from the issue, the House votes Tuesday on a resolution to authorize court action to enforce subpoenas for Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn.\n\nThe House will also vote to empower committees to bypass full floor votes for civil contempt actions to go to court with their subpoenas -- a move that could take some pressure off these Democrats from Republican districts.\n\nEven if Democrats in swing districts ultimately decide to support an impeachment inquiry, that doesn't mean it will happen. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has made it clear she wants bipartisan support for an impeachment path before she pursues one, and so far only one Republican has called for an inquiry , Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan.\n\nIf the 60 or so House Democrats who currently support an inquiry are to succeed, they'll need to convince their moderate colleagues first. That will be difficult, since these Democrats face a complex political calculation on the issue.\n\n\"Nobody knows what the political impact will be, and therefore it is a risk,\" Malinowski told the New Jersey Star-Ledger in late May, describing his decision to support an impeachment inquiry\n\nAs long as Malinowski remains an outlier among moderate Democrats, Pelosi is likely to continue resisting calls for impeachment from the left flank of her caucus, urging House committees to continue their investigations of Trump instead.\n\nRegardless of her political strategy, Pelosi made her personal feelings known last week, when behind closed doors she told Democratic leaders she wanted to see Trump in \"prison,\" according to Politico.\n\nKeep investigating\n\nMost of these moderate Democrats have made clear that they want to see the current investigations in Congress proceed and see where that leads.\n\n\"I'm very deliberate and thorough, and I don't want to go down any road until I have all the facts,\" Rep. Jennifer Wexton of Virginia, said at a recent town hall when asked about impeachment. \"So all options are on the table.\"\n\nThe office of Rep. Donna Shalala of Florida told CNN that the congresswoman \"is undecided until the Judiciary Committee completes its work,\" a reference to current and ongoing investigations.\n\nShalala recently told the Sun-Sentinel newspaper that she is not ready to support an inquiry at this time, but indicated that could change. \"Not yet, but you know, we're getting closer and closer,\" she said.\n\nIn their statements to CNN, some members underscored the gravity of impeachment and how an inquiry is not to be taken lightly.\n\n\"Going down the path of impeachment would be very divisive for the country,\" Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia told CNN in a statement. \"We need to have all of the facts before we consider such an option, and I support the important investigative work being done by the appropriate committees in the House.\"\n\nNo way\n\nOther members in swing districts are flat out opposed to impeachment, and say it's simply time to move on.\n\n\"I'm not in favor of impeachment. I think we've got to move forward and try to look at issues that we can find compromise on,\" Rep. Anthony Brindisi of New York told New York Now in late May, adding, \"This is what I'm hearing from people back home who are not focused on that issue, but are focused on the immediate concerns that they are facing.\"\n\nRep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey said he's practically \"done\" with talking about impeachment and that people are \"tired of the investigations.\"\n\n\"I welcome conversations on improving the lives of Americans, on immigration, on health care, on any of the many issues that affect people every day,\" he said. \"But what I am done with, barring any new evidence, is any talk of impeachment, investigations, or divisive, unproductive politics.\"\n\nUndecided\n\nIn between are some members who are openly undecided on which way they're leaning. At a town hall recently, Rep. Katie Porter of California said she had seen \"a real turning point\" on the impeachment push, but \"I haven't made a public decision yet.\"\n\nAnd some, like Rep. Mike Levin of California, are open to the possibility of an inquiry, but still are not calling for one themselves at this time.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the congressman explained that he plans to defer to the judgment of his colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee and \"if they deem it necessary\" to start an inquiry, he would support that.\n\n\"I do not sit on the House Judiciary Committee, but I trust the judgment of my colleagues who do. If they deem it necessary to begin an impeachment inquiry as the most effective means to proceed, I will support that decision,\" he said.",

It was updated on July 8 after Adm. William Moran announced his retirement.\n\nWashington (CNN) 19 of the most senior roles at the Pentagon lack permanent appointees, after it was announced that Adm. William Moran who was set to become the branch's top uniformed officer is instead retiring after his judgment was questioned over a professional relationship he maintained with a former Navy public affairs official who left the Navy after an investigation into alleged incidents of sexual misconduct.\n\nThat brings the total of number of roles without permanent appointees to nineteen. Last week the Department of Defense confirmed to CNN that eighteen roles were unfilled, providing a complete list of positions currently being filled by temporary officials.\n\nIt is a reflection of the Department of Defense's ongoing struggle to establish an unprecedented transition plan aimed at ensuring continuity of leadership at the highest levels while there is still no confirmed secretary of defense.\n\nThe top priority is to get Mark Esper's nomination to the Senate Armed Services Committee so a confirmation hearing for the acting secretary of defense can be scheduled quickly. Esper stepped into the acting position following the dramatic implosion of Patrick Shanahan's nomination last month.\n\nDue to federal regulations, Esper is expected to have to instantly step down as the acting secretary during that confirmation process, several officials have said. Government lawyers are looking to see if there are any loopholes that could keep him in the job through a confirmation vote, a defense official previously told CNN.\n\nRead More",
