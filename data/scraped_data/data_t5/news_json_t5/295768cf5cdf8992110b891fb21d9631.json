        "text": "Jerhonda Pace was just 15 when she met her musical idol, R. Kelly, outside his child pornography trial. The alleged underage sexual relationship with him that followed and subsequent payouts mirror decades of allegations against the star.\n\nKristen Zeis for BuzzFeed News Jerhonda Pace on Aug. 17.\n\nIn 2008, Jerhonda Johnson was a 15-year-old sophomore from Chicago’s south suburbs who cut high school every day to attend R. Kelly’s trial on 14 counts of making child pornography. The R&B superstar had no bigger fan, and Johnson was quoted in national media stories defending her musical idol.\n\nNow a 24-year-old mother of three with the married name Jerhonda Pace, she tells BuzzFeed News that after the trial, when she was 16, she became one of many women traumatized by a sexual relationship with Kelly. Her detailed and well-documented story of accepting cash settlements from the star in return for signing nondisclosure agreements, which has not been previously reported, illustrates how Kelly has been able to silence young women he has allegedly wronged.\n\nRick Kern / WireImage R. Kelly in concert at Bass Concert Hall on March 3, 2017, in Austin.\n\nSeveral individuals with firsthand knowledge of the situation have supported Pace’s claims. Additionally, BuzzFeed News reviewed signed legal documents, drafts of settlements between Kelly and Pace, correspondence between Pace and the attorneys involved, a polygraph test performed at the request of her attorney regarding her relationship with Kelly, a probate court document opening an estate for Pace as the result of a civil settlement, and a subsequent payment made by Kelly’s management company to Pace. Representatives for Kelly issued a statement early Tuesday morning denying Pace's allegations. “The allegations against Mr. Kelly are false, and are being made by individuals known to be dishonest. It is clear these continuing stories are the result of the effort of those with personal agendas who are working in concert to interfere with and damage his career. Mr. Kelly again denies any and all wrong doing and is taking appropriate legal action to protect himself from ongoing defamation.”\n\nPace is the fourth former member of Kelly’s circle to tell BuzzFeed News that the star mentally and physically abuses the women closest to him. Kelly has faced similar allegations for years: In 2005, for example, his then-wife, Andrea Lee, filed for an order of protection in Cook County Circuit Court, alleging that her husband had slapped and hit her, and demanding “no contact at all by any means.” She later dropped that order. Pace's story is different than previously reported accounts because she was underage when she and Kelly began a sexual relationship. Pace says she is talking now — and breaking a signed nondisclosure agreement — because she is concerned about women still living with Kelly in what police have been told is an abusive “cult,” as BuzzFeed News first reported last month. Pace says she’s particularly concerned about a friend she brought into Kelly’s circle when they were both teenagers and who multiple sources say still lives with Kelly.\n\n“If I can speak out and I can help them get out of that situation, that’s what I will do.”\n\nKelly has adamantly denied allegations of wrongdoing, and one alleged victim, 21-year-old Joycelyn Savage, has said she is doing fine. Her parents, and the parents of an 18-year-old aspiring singer from Florida, have all said they have been told there is an ongoing federal investigation into Kelly, but an FBI spokesman declined requests for comment from BuzzFeed News. “If I can speak out and I can help them get out of that situation, that’s what I will do,” Pace says. “I didn’t have anybody to speak up on my behalf when I was going through what I was going through with him. He’s brainwashed them really bad, and it kind of reminds me of Charles Manson.” “I just really hope I can help these women out,” she says. “Kelly needs to be stopped.”\n\nMaggie Rife Pace waiting for Kelly’s arrival outside the Cook County Circuit Court on April 1, 2008. Kelly was being tried for child pornography.\n\nPace says she first became a self-described R. Kelly “superfan” when she heard his album Chocolate Factory at age 11. “My family listened to his music, my friends listened to his music, everybody was just in love with the music. [Chicago radio station] WGCI was the biggest supporter — they played him all the time — and it was my favorite radio station.”\n\nHer fandom didn’t fade when Kelly was indicted for making child pornography, Pace says. Once the trial began in May 2008, she attended the proceedings every day until Kelly’s acquittal on June 13 of that year. If convicted, Kelly could have been sentenced to 15 years in prison. (While working at the Chicago Sun-Times, this reporter received the tape anonymously and turned it over to the police; called by Kelly's attorneys to testify, he took the Fifth Amendment rather than revealing sources.) Looking back, Pace says she attended the trial because she was a fan and wanted to know what happened. “Did he really do it?” she recalls wondering. “I wanted to see everything for myself.” That included watching the notorious video when it was shown several times in court.\n\n“At the time I was still, you know, pretty starstruck, so I was in disbelief.”\n\nProsecutors alleged that the 26-minute, 39-second video depicted Kelly having sex with a 14-year-old girl, urinating in her mouth, and ordering her to call him “daddy.” Pace says watching the video was “disturbing.” But because the girl and her parents never testified— though 14 other witnesses, including her aunt, did identify the girl — Pace says she thought, Well, maybe that’s not the girl. If she would have come forward, I think it would have made a huge difference. Outside of court at the time, she defended Kelly to multiple news outlets. \"They can't call him a pedophile anymore,\" Pace, then 15, told MTV. \"They can't say he likes little girls. They don't have proof of that. Because he's innocent now. He's free.\" The MTV article reported that Pace was 18, but public records, as well as Pace’s birth certificate and driver’s license, show she was actually 15 at the time; she admits she lied to the reporter because Cook County sheriff’s officers were not admitting anyone under 18 into the trial.\n\nTasos Katopodis / Getty Images Kelly arriving at Cook County Court for his hearings on Dec. 20, 2007.\n\nPace says she met Kelly when he was walking into the court building. The star “seemed like a cool guy, and he would always speak to me when he saw me,” she recalls. She even got the singer’s autograph, which she provided to BuzzFeed News. “He didn’t have anything to sign, and neither did I, but my friend reached into her pocket and found an old bank slip, so I got his autograph on her bank slip. I laminated that.” That meeting with Kelly would not be her last. In May 2009, a friend and employee of Kelly's friended Pace on Myspace, Pace tells BuzzFeed News, and invited her to a party Kelly was throwing at his mansion in suburban Olympia Fields, Illinois. Pace, who had just turned 16, says she lied to her parents, telling them she was going to a friend’s house. “I was a bit nervous,” she says. “Even though I had already met him at his trial, I was like literally at his house, so it did not feel real.” She remembers Kelly calling her over to the bar and telling her he had noticed her at the trial. He then asked for her cell phone and entered his number in it. “At the time I was still, you know, pretty starstruck, so I was in disbelief,” she says. Pace says she did not tell Kelly she was underage, and would later tell private investigators she claimed to be 19 years old at the time. (The age of consent in Illinois is 17.) Not long after, on June 5, 2009, Pace says Kelly invited her to come back to his mansion and sent an employee to pick her up in a black SUV. “He told me that he wanted me to undress for him [and] walk back and forth like I was modeling,” she says. The two then had oral sex and, Pace said in interviews with BuzzFeed News and her 2010 polygraph interview, Kelly made his first attempt to ensure that she did not talk about their sexual relationship by having her write out and sign letters stating that she had stolen jewelry and cash from him and that her parents had set her up to blackmail him. Pace says she did as instructed, but none of the charges were true. On the next visit, on June 9, Pace says Kelly gave her an alcoholic drink he called Sex in the Kitchen, which is also the name of a song he released in 2005. “I was drunk, because I wasn’t used to alcohol,” Pace says. The two had intercourse; Pace says she was a virgin, and Kelly thought that was exciting. Over the next seven months, Pace says she had sex with Kelly repeatedly, a claim she would later repeat during her settlement process. Without asking her permission, Kelly filmed most of the encounters on his iPhone or a video camera on a tripod, Pace says and a settlement draft reiterates. “I had to call him ‘daddy,’ and he would call me ‘baby.’ He wanted me to have two pigtails, and I had to go out and find little schoolgirl outfits.” If Kelly was previously unaware of Pace’s age, she says she told him for certain that she was 16 on July 17, 2009, a claim she also made in the aforementioned documents. “I gave him my state ID,” she says. She recalls that Kelly told her things were fine, but that she should tell anyone who asked that she was 19, and act like she was 25. Pace says that she started spending weekends with Kelly at his Olympia Fields home. While she was in the mansion, she says, she had to follow Kelly’s “rules,” which included dressing in baggy clothes, turning over her phone, and asking permission to shower, eat, go to the bathroom, and leave the property. If she broke the rules, she says, she was mentally and physically abused. “At the time, I didn’t know what I liked, honestly,” Pace says, explaining why she complied. “I just knew that I liked his music, so I was pretty much accepting of anything that came with him at the time.” According to Pace, she and her 17-year-old friend, a fellow superfan she’d met on Myspace who sources say still lives with Kelly today, were hanging out at Kelly’s Olympia Fields mansion in July 2009 when police in two squad cards arrived in search of the friend, whose mother had called to complain that her young daughter was with Kelly. Pace, both when speaking to BuzzFeed News and during her 2010 polygraph test, says that Kelly called one of his attorneys, who advised his star client that he did not have to let the police into the house if they did not have a warrant.\n\n“I was slapped and I was choked and I was spit on.”\n\nAt the time, Police Chief Jeff Chudwin told the Southtown Star: “[We] were informed of a possible criminal matter. We investigated the issues, found there to be no crime, and the matters have been closed.” A spokesperson for Kelly called the report “wildly exaggerated,” adding that “no police ever showed up at Kelly’s house with a search warrant nor was his house ever searched.” A few days later, the newspaper noted that Kelly was “the largest taxpayer in the village of 4,700,” with his property taxes representing one-tenth of the police department’s budget for 2008. Pace says Kelly asked her to engage in threesomes, including with a woman who was best friends since high school with the girl in the videotape for which Kelly was tried. BuzzFeed News previously reported that this woman was still living with Kelly as of the summer of 2016. Pace says she also saw the girl in the videotape at a party in Olympia Fields, and that she recognized her from watching the video in court. Pace says she ended her relationship with Kelly in January 2010 after the two had an argument when Kelly caught her texting a friend. “I was slapped and I was choked and I was spit on,” she says, a claim repeated in the settlement draft and corresponding polygraph. Pace says she left Kelly’s house, but her ordeal was far from over.\n\nKristen Zeis for BuzzFeed News Jerhonda Pace\n\nThe next day, Pace recalls, she contacted the offices of Chicago attorney Susan E. Loggans. “It was on their website that they had worked with a lot of women who went against Kelly, and I thought, Oh, that’s a good thing,” Pace says. Loggans declined to comment, but her firm has made extracting cash settlements from Kelly a specialized part of its practice. A 2011 ad for the firm boasts that high-profile clients have included “two underage girls who claimed the R&B superstar R. Kelly had sex with them.” Loggans first represented three women in the late ’90s and early 2000s in cases brought against Kelly filed in Cook County. After these three publicly filed lawsuits, Loggans began negotiating other settlements between Kelly and young women she represented before lawsuits were ever filed. She has declined to say exactly how many settlements she has negotiated, other than to say they were “numerous.” Loggans first sued Kelly for $10 million on Dec. 24, 1997, in a suit brought by Chicago woman Tiffany “Tia” Hawkins, an aspiring singer who claimed she met the star when he spoke to her sophomore choir class. According to the lawsuit, Hawkins began having sex with Kelly in 1991, when she was 15 and he was 24. The relationship ended in December 1994, when she was 18, the court documents state; distraught, she slit her wrists in an attempt to kill herself. The charges in the suit were not reported until years later, in a December 2000 Chicago Sun-Times article, the first major investigative story detailing Kelly’s illegal underage sexual relationships. The case eventually was settled out of court when Kelly paid Hawkins an undisclosed sum, sources said. Loggans next sued Kelly in August 2001 when she represented another Chicago woman, Tracy Sampson, an aspiring rapper who claimed she lost her virginity to the star at age 17, which is the age of consent in Illinois. “I was often treated as his personal sex object and cast aside,” Sampson claimed in the lawsuit. “He often tried to control every aspect of my life including who I would see and where I would go.” The case was eventually settled out of court when Kelly paid Sampson an undisclosed sum, sources said.\n\n“If I was to get criminal charges, it would probably be like it was last time, where he wouldn’t get convicted.”\n\nThe last public lawsuit that Loggans filed against Kelly was in April 2002, when she represented Patrice Jones, a Chicago woman who claimed the star impregnated her when she was underage, and that one of his associates took her to have an abortion. The lawsuit alleged that the relationship began after Kelly met the 16-year-old in December 1998 at the Rock ’n Roll McDonald’s in Chicago after her high school prom. The case eventually was settled out of court when Kelly paid Jones an undisclosed sum, sources said. Pace says that when she went to Loggans for assistance, she was told that the attorneys would make her a millionaire. That’s when she decided to pursue a settlement instead of criminal charges. “If I was to get criminal charges, it would probably be like it was last time, where he wouldn’t get convicted,” Pace considered at the time. To verify Pace’s story, Loggans asked Pace take the aforementioned lie detector test. BuzzFeed News obtained a seven-page document about the test conducted by F.L. Hunter and Associates in suburban Hinsdale on Jan. 9, 2010. The results were sent to Loggans in a letter dated Feb. 1, 2010. The document details four questions that Pace was asked, including whether she had intercourse with Kelly, if she had told him she was 16, and whether he slapped, choked, and spit on her during an argument. She answered yes to all questions. “It is the opinion of this examiner, based upon an analysis of her polygraph records, that she is truthful in her answers,” Hunter concluded. Hunter has since retired from the firm that still bears his name. According to Pace, within weeks of the meeting in Loggans’ office, the attorney had negotiated a large settlement with Kelly in return for Pace signing a nondisclosure agreement and declining to pursue any charges or other claims against Kelly. Since Pace was still a minor, Loggans and her mother opened an estate on her behalf, according to Pace and court records obtained by BuzzFeed News. But Pace says she only received a fraction of what was owed her. In 2012, Pace complained to Loggans’ assistant about late or missing payments from Kelly, according to emails reviewed by BuzzFeed News. In that period, Pace’s settlement was far from Kelly’s only expense: In 2009, Kelly divorced his second wife, Andrea Lee, with whom he had three children, and he was paying spousal and child support. In 2012, Kelly owed the IRS nearly $5 million in unpaid taxes dating back to 2005. In 2013, the star sold the Olympia Fields mansion once valued at more than $5 million for $950,000 years after it went into foreclosure. Down the line, Pace says and other sources confirmed, she went on to sign a new settlement agreement with Kelly. BuzzFeed News reviewed a subsequent payment made by Kelly’s management company, RSK Enterprises LLC, to Pace as recently as July 15, 2015. Pace’s current attorney refused to comment.\n\n“I've been holding this in for so many years, and to see that he always gets away with it, it’s just not right.\"\n\nThe settlement draft stipulates that for both Kelly and Pace, “the terms and existence of this Agreement and of the [earlier] 2010 Settlement Agreement shall be strictly confidential.” It includes a “non-disparagement clause” detailing that “the parties agree that they each shall refrain from any and all conduct, verbal or otherwise, that disparages or damages… the reputation, good will or standing in the community of the other party.” Pace says that she could face legal action for violating the terms of her agreement by talking publicly about her experience with Kelly. But given Kelly’s continued personal and professional success, and the crimes she says he committed, she says speaking out is worth the risk. “His music overshadows everything when it comes to his wrongdoings,” Pace says. “Nobody thinks about the damage he's done or is doing to young women, and his personal life means nothing when it comes to executives making money off of him.” Following BuzzFeed's initial reporting on Kelly, Live Nation refused the call of thousands of fans as well as local politicians to cancel his Aug. 25 concert in Atlanta. Kelly’s label, Sony Music, has refused to comment. Despite signing a nondisclosure agreement — which may not necessarily preclude reporting a crime — and threats of legal action, Pace is considering pursuing criminal charges against Kelly. “I know speaking out against Kelly, Kelly could sue me. But I’m really not worried about it anymore,” Pace says. “I feel like this is a healing process for me, because I've been holding this in for so many years, and to see that he always gets away with it, it’s just not right. I’m just going forward with my head held high.” ● Additional reporting by Marisa Carroll and Talal Ansari",

        "text": "R. Kelly bowed his head and wept Friday as he was cleared of child pornography charges, acquitted by a jury that deliberated for just 7 1/2 hours over a case that took six years to bring to trial.\n\nWiping tears from his face with a blue silk handkerchief, Kelly clasped his attorneys' hands and prayed as he was cleared on all 14 counts in the indictment.\n\n\"Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus,\" Kelly said softly as the clerk read off each not-guilty.\n\nAfter Cook County Judge Vincent Gaughan dismissed the jury and left the bench, the singer's entourage rushed into the well of the courtroom and pulled Kelly into bear hugs. As Kelly celebrated, lead prosecutor Shauna Boliker walked to the defense table and shook hands with his attorneys.\n\nBoliker and her team had simply failed to persuade jurors that the female in the sex videotape was the R&B superstar's then-underage goddaughter, a girl who would have been as young as 13 at the time the tape was made.\n\nMany jurors believed Kelly was the man in the tape, but they couldn't be sure that his goddaughter was the female. Without her testimony, the panel relied on a low-quality VHS tape and still photographs to determine the two participants' identities.\n\n\"Most of us felt that maybe it was Kelly, maybe not,\" said juror John Petrean, a Romanian immigrant. \"But nobody could agree if it was her. We had seen photos of her at other times and she seemed like a young girl. It seemed like the girl on the tape was much more developed.\"\n\nThe prosecution called 14 witnesses, including several of the alleged victim's relatives, former friends and basketball coaches, to identify her on the tape. Many said they discounted the testimony of the young woman's relatives because the family was so split in its opinion on the identity of the girl in the tape.\n\n\"It seemed to me [that the goddaughter's family] was very divided over this from the beginning,\" Petrean said.\n\nThe jury accepted the tape's legitimacy, discrediting defense theories that it had been doctored as part of an elaborate extortion plan. The panel also did not debate the much-hyped mole theory. Kelly's attorneys had insisted that Kelly had a caterpillar-shaped mole along his spine and the man in the tape had an unblemished back.\n\nState's Atty. Richard Devine, who attended the verdict announcement but did not participate in the trial, defended the prosecution, which has languished for six years under myriad delays and more than 50 pre-trial motions. Devine said he would do it again if confronted with the same evidence.\n\n\"As we must, we accept the verdict of the jury in this case,\" Devine said. \"This prosecution is one we have no reservations about.\"\n\nThe singer, whose full name is Robert Kelly, left the Criminal Courts Building without speaking to the media. His spokesman later issued a statement saying Kelly had been confident that he would be cleared of the \"terrible charges.\"\n\n\"He did not expect that it would take 6 1/2 years,\" spokesman Allan Mayer said. \"It's been a terrible ordeal for him and his family, and at this point all he wants to do is move forward and try to put it behind him. He wants to thank his lawyers who defended him so brilliantly. He wants to thank his fans who stuck by him and supported him with such love. Most of all, he wants to thank God for giving him the strength to get through this.\"\n\nKelly was indicted in 2002 on charges he videotaped himself engaging in sex with his goddaughter some time between 1998 and 2000. Prosecutors said the girl was as young as 13 at the time.\n\nThe Grammy winner, who shot to international stardom with \"I Believe I Can Fly,\" long professed his . During a 2002 grand jury appearance, his goddaughter, now 23, also denied her involvement in the tape, and refused to cooperate with the prosecution.\n\nHer absence during the trial played a key role in deliberations, jurors said. Following nearly five weeks of testimony, the panel of nine men and three women had initially been split, but after intense debate and hourly votes, the holdouts eventually conceded that reasonable doubt existed, members said.\n\nThe verdict stunned many, especially because it came about 30 minutes after three alternate jurors told the media they would have favored guilty verdicts for Kelly. Though they would have wanted to review the evidence with the rest of the panel, they said they believed both Kelly and his goddaughter appeared in an undoctored sex tape.\n\nKelly's defense team shrugged off the trio's views.\n\n\"It's a good thing they were alternates,\" attorney Sam Adam Jr. said jokingly.\n\nThe verdict, however, gave Kelly's high-priced defense team the last laugh at experts who publicly suggested the lawyers had picked a jury unfavorable to Kelly. The panel included a preacher's wife, a self-described Christian and a Department of Children and Family Services employee. Even the foreman told the attorneys that he thought Kelly was guilty during the selection process.\n\n\"We didn't care what the jurors thought about the case before the trial,\" attorney Marc Martin said. \"We wanted intelligent people who would keep an open mind, and we found them.\"\n\nLead defense attorney Edward Genson, who said he \"graduated from late middle-age to senior citizen\" while working on the case, said there simply wasn't enough evidence to convict Kelly.\n\n\"R. Kelly got his name back, and (his goddaughter) never had to lose her virtue,\" Adam Jr. said outside the courtroom.\n\nKelly's goddaughter also weighed heavily on prosecutors' minds as they answered questions from an eclectic group of news and entertainment reporters. With journalists from as far away as England, France and Germany, Boliker said she hopes the case demonstrated the challenges of fighting child pornography.\n\n\"If we do anything with this prosecution,\" she said, \"we show the world how difficult it is to prosecute.\"\n\nNews of the verdict whipped through the courthouse as reporters ran to call in dispatches and deputies sent word over their radios. In a crowd of assistant state's attorneys and support staff waiting outside the overflow courtroom, several people could be heard gasping in disbelief.\n\nKelly and his entourage -- whose members wept during the reading of the verdict -- made a swift exit from the building and were greeted with thunderous applause on the courthouse steps. The singer placed his hand on his heart in a gesture of gratitude and saluted the crowd before climbing into his black Ford Expedition and returning to his tour bus blocks away.",

        "text": "'There is nothing that he could ever do to make me doubt him,' one of the two women tells MTV News.\n\nR. Kelly's Biggest Fans -- Who Came To Every Day Of Singer's Trial -- 'Never Had Any Doubt They Would Find Him Not Guilty'\n\nEvery day, two young women waited for R. Kelly.\n\nThey waited in the morning outside the courthouse to see him make his entrance. They then went and got the equivalent of a backstage pass, so they could be spectators inside the courtroom, in the back rows allotted for the public. During the lunch break, they ran over to nearby Douglas Park to see him go to his tour bus for a private meal, away from prying eyes.\n\nAt the end of the day, they tried to run out of the building before he did, so they could have a final goodbye. They shouted, \"I love you!\" and he smiled and waved back. And they cussed out any reporter they thought had done Kelly wrong, on his behalf. One of them commuted 40 miles (by train and then by bus) for this. The other skipped school and left her 2-year-old son with her mother. These young women — 18-year-old Jerhonda Johnson and 23-year-old Keyonia Jones — are the superfans. They are the most unwavering in their dedication to the star, even though he stood accused of taking advantage of a girl not much different from themselves.\n\nSo when the verdict came down on Friday, Johnson and Jones felt like they were vindicated too.\n\n\"From the beginning, I thought he was innocent,\" Jones said. \"I never had any doubt they would find him not guilty. And when they read the verdict, I wanted to scream, but I didn't. I had to control my happiness until I got outside.\"\n\n\"Even though my eyes were watering, I didn't let the tears fall down,\" Johnson said. \"They did after a little bit.\"\n\nJones is a criminal-justice student at Harold Washington College, and though her next semester started while the trial was in progress, she decided being in Kelly's courtroom was a better classroom than her school could have provided. \"It was my first real trial that I saw that wasn't on television or scripted,\" she said. \"I was like, 'Oh, it's like this.' It helped a lot for my major, and it made me think about going to law school.\"\n\nSo even though Jones is such a dedicated fan that she named her 2-year-old son Robert (and plans to name any future ones Sylvester and then Kelly, to flesh out his full name), she tried to put herself into the mindset of the jury and consider all the evidence. \"Going into it, I felt he was innocent,\" she said. \"But then I thought, 'Lemme put aside R. Kelly and just listen to what they got to say.' \" With as open a mind as she could muster, Jones watched the tape. She looked for the mole on his back. She listened to Sparkle testify. But then Jones concluded, \"All she wanted was money. And all the other ladies [such as witness Lisa Van Allen wanted money.\"\n\n\"The state had some bad witnesses,\" Johnson said. \"They didn't have any of her immediate family, so I was like, 'They didn't prove the case.' \"\n\nThe jury might have thought it was Kelly on the tape, but these two were not convinced. \"I say it wasn't him,\" Johnson said. \"It wasn't R. Kelly at all. In 1998, 1999, he did not look like that. Yeah, he was bald, he had a nice body, but he did not have a gut, and he had one on the tape. He had a six-pack and everything back then. He was sexy. I mean, he still is, but the man on the tape was so different.\"\n\nAnd though these young women would kill for Kelly to talk to them, they didn't want him to do it from the witness stand. \"I thought it would be the dumbest thing for him to do, to testify,\" Jones said. \"Because then they'd be able to use his past against him, and they would probably convict him.\"\n\nBy \"his past,\" is Jones referring to the other underage girls who previously sued him? \"Yes, and the whole thing about him supposedly marrying Aaliyah when she was underage,\" Jones said. She doesn't believe the marriage happened — you could show her the marriage license, and she still wouldn't believe it. You could have it on tape, so to speak, and she still would be his biggest fan, as would her friend.\n\n\"There is nothing that he could ever do to make me doubt him,\" Jones said. \"Nothing.\"\n\n\"They can't call him a pedophile anymore,\" Johnson said. \"They can't say he likes little girls. They don't have proof of that. Because he's innocent now. He's free.\"\n\nFind a review of the major players in the R. Kelly trial here. For full coverage of the case, read the R.

        "text": "As outlined in the prosecution’s opening and closing statements, the case was intended to be clear-cut: the “sweet, nice, lovely” victim was introduced to Mr. Kelly at the age of 12 by her aunt, a protégé of Mr. Kelly’s named Stephanie Edwards. But instead of making the girl a star, Mr. Kelly preyed on her, made her do “vile, disgusting” things and filmed them. Since Mr. Kelly knew she was under age, the state said, he was guilty of making child pornography.\n\nExpert witnesses for the prosecution said that the VHS tape, whose origin is unknown, was a multigeneration copy but had not been tampered with. Prosecutors also pointed out how the man on the tape turned his back briefly to the camera. It was less than a quarter of a second, but enough time to see a mole on his back — just like the one Mr. Kelly has.\n\nWhile 14 witnesses for the prosecution identified the girl in the tape, and some identified Mr. Kelly as well, only one tied them together in a sexual relationship. That was Lisa Van Allen, who testified that she had a three-way sexual encounter with them.\n\nMs. Van Allen, who received state and federal immunity to testify, did not appear to be an unimpeachable witness. She told the court that she had first had sex with Mr. Kelly at age 17, immediately after being introduced to him on the set of one of his videos, and admitted that she stole a $20,000 Rolex from him. Her current boyfriend and a former boyfriend are both felons.\n\nThe defense team called her a liar and extortionist and compared her, literally, to Satan.\n\nMr. Kelly’s lawyers, who included Edward Genson, Sam Adam and his son, Sam Adam Jr., filed so many motions that they helped delay the start of the trial for six years. But once in court, the lawyers adopted a minimalist approach, limiting their side of the story to two days. Mr. Kelly did not testify.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the time this seemed to reveal a weakness of the defense’s case. The defense team never even denied that the tape had been shot in Mr. Kelly’s former home.\n\nAs portrayed by Sam Adam Jr. in closing arguments, Mr. Kelly was less predator than prey, the victim of a loose conspiracy by Ms. Edwards, whose career disappeared after a falling-out with the star, as well as Ms. Van Allen and others searching for a payoff, revenge or both.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“This whole thing, from beginning to end, is about money,” Mr. Adam said.\n\nFlailing his arms, he suggested not one but many alternate narratives: that the mole on the back of the man in the film didn’t exist, was a computer blip or was inserted by an unknown someone for nefarious purposes; that the film itself was a fake; that it had computer morphing in it like the dinosaurs in “Jurassic Park”; or that it starred models or prostitutes who looked like Mr. Kelly and his alleged victim.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I do everything pro bono when I fight for the innocent like Mr. Kelly.”\n\nThe prosecution team, at a post-trial news conference, looked both stoic and shocked.\n\n“Child pornography cases can be extremely difficult in many ways,” said Cook County State’s Attorney Richard Devine, noting that the victims often do not consider themselves victims. “If we receive similar evidence today or tomorrow, we are going to bring that case.”\n\nLeonard Cavise, a professor of law at DePaul University who was skeptical of the prosecutors’ case, said the optimistic way to look at the verdict was that “this is a victory for the concept of reasonable doubt.” The jury, he said, “is saying, ‘We weren’t totally sure it was the girl, we weren’t totally sure it was him.’ ”\n\nThe negative way, Mr. Cavise said, would be this: “The jury gave him the extra benefit of the doubt because of who he is, just like the O. J. Simpson jury.”\n\nIn some ways, this case did not resemble the Simpson case. R. Kelly is a Chicago success story and still makes his home here, yet as a public spectacle the trial was something of a bust.\n\nThe courthouse is in an inconveniently located neighborhood, the charges were old, and allegations of the singer’s interest in under-age women are older still. On most days there was more courtroom security than spectators.",

        "text": "Image zoom\n\nMusic Biz type Movie\n\nImage zoom\n\nOn Thursday, R. Kelly rolled up to Chicago’s Cook County Courthouse in a black SUV, just as he had for the previous several days — except he seemed to have more of a skip in his step. It was a noticeable change from the blank air he had been giving off all week during jury selection for his child pornography trial. Perhaps he was happy to see the small crowd of fans standing outside chanting “Free R. Kelly” and singing “I Believe I Can Fly” as he walked toward the building. Or it could be that the singer had a sense of what was about to happen: That all 12 jurors and four alternates would finally be chosen, thus ending the tedium of jury selection so that the trial could move forward next Tuesday.\n\naddCredit(“Vanessa Juarez”)\n\nSo who wound up being selected for the jury? There are four African Americans: a man in his\n\n40s who works as a chef; a self-described Christian in\n\nhis 50s who knows of Barry Hankerson (the uncle of late singer Aaliyah\n\nwho could potentially be called as a witness); a female teacher’s aide\n\nin her late 20s or early 30s; and a middle-aged woman who is married to\n\na pastor and resides in Olympia Fields, the same neighborhood Kelly\n\nlives in. The eight white jurors consist of a man in his 40s who\n\npreviously served as a juror on a another case; a twentysomething female criminal-justice student; a compliance officer\n\nin his 30s; an executive and father of two; a man who says\n\nhe’s seen faded-out clips of the alleged video on the news but can\n\njudge the case fairly; a male recent college graduate who was once\n\narrested for possession of marijuana and underage drinking; a\n\n68-year-old Romanian-American who said he’s “probably not the smartest\n\nguy but will do what is best and fair”; and a young woman who admitted to having once been the victim of rape. (During her interview with Judge Vincent Gaughan and the attorneys,\n\nthat juror indicated that sitting through the trial could be difficult, but that she would be able to put her own history aside and judge Kelly fairly.) The alternates consist of a\n\nwhite man in his 20s who has an uncle that was convicted of child\n\npornography; a Hispanic man who is about 19 years old; and two black women, one of whom was previously a deputy sheriff in the same\n\ncourthouse.\n\nRace was a big issue during the selection. The defense lawyers\n\naccused the state attorneys of using their preemptory challenges (they\n\neach had six strikes at their disposal) to prevent African Americans\n\nfrom getting on the panel, and the prosecution cried foul over the\n\nreverse. “I don’t look at people like that. It’s all one color to me,”\n\nKelly’s head defense attorney, Edward Genson, said this week. Today, another defense attorney noted that 50\n\npercent of the challenges used by the prosecution were for African\n\nAmericans; the prosecution rebutted, “they’ve used all six\n\npreemptory strikes on whites.” At least 62 of the 150 potential jurors who filled out\n\npreliminary questionnaires were brought in this week for follow-up\n\ninterviews. Of those, some were familiar with Kelly’s music, some\n\nweren’t. Some said they would not be able to get past the thought of\n\ntheir own kids when the time comes to view the infamous videotape of Kelly allegedly performing sex acts with a minor girl.\n\nOthers said they already had opinions about Kelly’s guilt (“he’s guilty, or why would the state bother?”) or innocence\n\n(one potential juror argued that the age of consent is “already too high as it is”) that they could not ignore.\n\nJerhonda Johnson and Keyonia Jones, two die-hard R. Kelly fans with\n\nstrawberry-colored hair, hung out at the courthouse all week long as\n\nKelly came in, left for lunch, returned, and then left for the day. EW.com\n\nspoke with them earlier this week about their support. “If he did it,\n\nthen he shouldn’t have recorded it,” said Jones, 23, who has a\n\n2-year-old son she named Robert, after Kelly. “I think he’s the same man\n\nwith two different personalities. I think there’s Robert and then R.\n\nKelly.” Johnson, who doesn’t think the state has a case, agreed: “Robert is the person who is coming to court. R. Kelly is the man who\n\nis behind the music.” Both women made it into the court room on Thursday\n\nafternoon to get a better look at Kelly (the trial is open to the public but there are a limited\n\nnumber of seats), and as the singer was on his way\n\nout, he waved and smiled at them. Since he faces 14 counts of child\n\npornography, he’s going to need all of the support he can get: Each\n\ncount carries with it a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.\n\nSo who wound up being selected for the jury?

        "text": "Chicago-born R&B superstar R. Kelly owes the Internal Revenue Service nearly $5 million in unpaid taxes dating as far back as 2005, according to tax liens filed recently in Cook County, the latest sign the Grammy winner's finances are in disarray.\n\nIn April, the IRS filed liens against Kelly, claiming he owes a total of $4.8 million from six different tax years, including $1.4 million from 2005 alone. The filings do not mark the first time Kelly has drawn scrutiny from the IRS. Since 2008, he has paid more than $3 million in back taxes after the IRS filed liens against him, county records show.\n\nThe earliest tax lien on record against Kelly was filed for his 2006 bill, which would have been due as Kelly was in embroiled in a legal battle over child pornography charges. He was acquitted in 2008, the year the IRS said he failed to pay $1.12 million he owed.\n\nKelly's representatives did not return a call seeking comment.\n\nKelly's 22,000-square-foot mansion in south suburban Olympia Fields went into foreclosure last year, with JPMorgan Chase claiming that the singer, whose name is Robert S. Kelly, owed it $2.9 million. The house was listed for sale for about $1.5 million but has been pulled off the market.\n\nWilmette-based tax attorney Steven Blanc, a former IRS trial attorney who also has worked for a Hollywood law firm, said even millionaires find themselves coming up short at tax time — especially entertainers.\n\n\"They have managers, who are supposed to be watching their money,\" he said. \"But when you get a call from your client at midnight and they're at a dealership and they ask you: 'Is it OK for me to buy a Lamborghini?' (the manager) always says yes, even if there's no money in the checking account. Because if they don't say yes, they get fired.\"\n\nThe IRS liens will tank Kelly's credit, but federal agents won't be seizing his property anytime soon.\n\n\"This is something they do to get your attention,\" Blanc said.\n\nagrimm@tribune.com",

        "text": "In the first video, there's an odd shadow on her.\n\nOne of the women whose parents told police she is being held captive by legendary R&B singer R. Kelly has now released two videos that aired on TMZ, but has not revealed where she is located.\n\n\n\nIn the first video, which appears to be an interview, Joycelyn Savage refused to reveal where she is — and refused to answer if she can leave that location. \"Are you currently in Georgia, or where are you?\" Savage is asked. \"I actually — I am not. No, I'm not. I wouldn't want to speak on that,\" she replied. \"Are you with other roommates, are you free to go where you are?\" Savage is asked — as what appears to be a shadow of a figure or hand projected onto Savage begins to gesture. \"No, I wouldn't speak on that as well,\" Savage, 21, responded. (The above GIF shows the shadow during that question at normal speed. The below GIF at a slowed speed.)\n\nThe first video was published late Monday, following an exclusive BuzzFeed News investigation reporting police have been told that Kelly is allegedly holding several women — including ones he told he’d take under his wing to advance their music careers — in his Duluth, Georgia, “guest house” or at his Chicago recording studio.\n\nThree people who were once part of Kelly's inner circle said, as BuzzFeed News wrote, that he \"controls every aspect of their lives: dictating what they eat, how they dress, when they bathe, when they sleep, and how they engage in sexual encounters that he records.\" Savage's father, Tim, said he still believes his daughter is being held against will and is being controlled.\n\n\"If you look at the video, and I looked at it over 10 times, the video has someone in the back telling her what to say and what not to say,\" Tim told BuzzFeed News. Tim, who confirmed that his daughter was on the TMZ video, said her inability to answer questions about where she was and if she was free to go was further evidence of her captivity. \"She couldn't answer that. You know why?\" Tim said, \"Because she's not free to go. She's not free to call her mother or father. She's being controlled by a woman or man.\"\n\nTim said that after watching the video he tried to call a cellphone he claims Kelly gave her daughter after confiscating her personal phone. \"I've tried to reach out to her. When I saw the video, I called and no one picked up the phone,\" Tim said. “I just mainly want to say I’m in a happy place with my life. And I’m not being brainwashed or anything like that,” Joycelyn said in the TMZ video, later adding that she's never felt like a hostage.\n\nThe second video was published on Tuesday by TMZ and shows Joycelyn sitting on a bench in a park. In TMZ's description of the video, it says \"she still won't give up her location — she says for 'safety reasons.'\" Joycelyn starts by saying that the video is for her family, but especially her father. \"Dad, you know everything that's going on with the media and the internet, and what you have done is a complete disaster,\" Joycelyn says, \"and you need to stop.\" She goes on to say that she's \"fed up\" and her father is embarrassing the family, adding that she's \"happy where I'm at and with the people that I'm around.\" \"Honestly you know the situation that had happened that night when I went to meet R. Kelly,\" Joycelyn says, possibly referring to when in 2015 she reportedly flew to Oklahoma City to see Kelly where he was performing. After the show, she had sex with Kelly, she later told her parents and at least two friends, according to BuzzFeed News' report. Joycelyn ends the video by saying she would like for her dad to \"stop what you're doing. Please.\" On Monday, Joycelyn mother, Jonjelyn Savage, said her daughter had been \"severely brainwashed\" at a news conference outside one of Kelly's rental properties near Atlanta that they say housed their child at one point.",

        "text": "\n\nKenny “Babyface” Edmonds performs at the 2015 Soul Train Awards. (Al Powers/Powers Imagery/Invision via AP)\n\nThis much is clear after Sunday night’s broadcast of the 2015 Soul Train Awards: Erykah Badu needs her own variety show, preferably one that’s buttressed with plenty of live performances by Badoula Oblongata herself.\n\nAfter entering the stage at Las Vegas’s Orleans Arena on a hoverboard (or scooter, or whatever we’re calling them these days) and belting out a medley of “Danger” and “On and On,” Badu made quick work of joking about her reputation as a rhymekiller.\n\n“As you know, I am the queen of neo soul and people say I have this common effect on rappers: that I make them change gods and wear crochet hats, shoulder pads,” Badu said. “So they have banned me from all of the hip-hop awards with a sign saying ‘Erykah Badu, leave our rappers alone.’ ”\n\nThe denizens of soul gathered Nov. 6 for this year’s Soul Train Awards, but the show wasn’t broadcast until Sunday night. At two and a half hours, it remained a bit bloated thanks to some questionable decision-making in the production. Why include a performance from Cameo, preceded by a lengthy pre-taped “Behind the Music” sketch following Larry Blackmon’s codpiece, but not give time for “Candy,” the band’s biggest hit?\n\nWhat looked like a promising performance by V. Bozeman, whom most know from “Empire,” was cut short to go to commercial, while a dubious and generously timed R. Kelly performance closed out the broadcast. One wonders if BET deliberately decided to include Kelly at the end, knowing discussion of Kelly’s reputation as a sexual predator would result in heightened social media mentions for the show. It would seem so, given that Badu introduced Kelly as someone “who has done more for black folks than anybody,” a declaration seemingly aimed more at stirring up controversy than anything else.\n\n\n\nJill Scott accepts the Lady of Soul Award at the 2015 Soul Train Awards. (Al Powers/Powers Imagery/Invision via AP)\n\nStill, the show had more strong points than weak ones: Tributes to Babyface, who was honored with the Legend Award, and Jill Scott, who received the Lady of Soul Award, featured bring-the-house-down performances from both. And after schooling the audience on the origins of Auto-Tune, Badu DJed a soul cypher featuring Lalah Hathaway, Eddie Levert, Chrisette Michele and K-Ci Hailey.\n\nThe show was completely devoted to honoring R&B and therefore supposedly devoid of rappers, although a few made it into the collaborations categories. Silentó, of “Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae)” fame won the award for best new artist.\n\nAnd it would seem no black award show is complete without a shady insult to Iggy Azalea. Taking over duties from Nicki Minaj and closing out the dead horse for the year, Badu included the Australian artist in a bit meant to emphasize the fact that rap was “banned” from the Soul Train Awards.\n\nAfter putting off mid-show inquiries from Andre 3000 and Young Thug, Badu’s phone rang a third time.\n\n“Who is this? Iggy Azalea? Yeah, hey! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! You can come,” Badu said into her phone. “Because what you’re doing is definitely not rap.”",

        "text": "As the R&B legend tours the country this summer, parents have told police that R. Kelly is keeping women against their will in an abusive \"cult\" that's tearing families apart. Three former members of Kelly’s inner circle told BuzzFeed News similar stories.\n\nBackstage at the Fantasy Springs Resort Casino in Indio, California, on May 23, 2015, J. was thrilled that her 19-year-old daughter’s music career was going to make a major leap forward from recording demos and performing at talent shows to the chance of stardom — thanks to the help of an R&B superstar.\n\n“When we got to go backstage with R. Kelly, we stayed there over two hours,” said J. “One-on-one with just me and my daughter and him. We went back to talk about the music. He listened to her CD. He was going to help her with her CD, and I was really impressed with him at first, because I have always been an R. Kelly fan.” J. said that Robert “R.” Kelly, who turned 50 in January, met her daughter backstage at a concert in Atlanta earlier that month. Soon enough, he’d invited her to fly out to the Indio concert on his dime. J. said she’d heard about past sexual misconduct accusations against Kelly, but wasn’t overly worried. She is a fiercely devoted stage mom — she and her husband of 22 years, Tim, a car dealer, had moved from Memphis to Atlanta to help their eldest child’s career — and was confident she could protect her daughter. “In the back of our minds, we were thinking [my daughter] could be around him if I was with her,” J. said. “It didn’t really hit home. Even with the Aaliyah situation, now that I think about it, ‘Age Ain’t Nothing But a Number’ ... but you don’t think about that. You grew up with the song, and you like the song.” Two years later, J. and Tim are in a desperate fight to bring their daughter home. (BuzzFeed News verified their identities and full names in public records, but is withholding the alleged victim's full name and her parents' last name to protect her privacy.)\n\n“It was as if she was brainwashed.”\n\nAs part of their efforts, the mother closed her businesses, became a relentless amateur detective, and shared her findings with the FBI and police in two states. But their daughter isn’t a missing person — at least not in the eyes of the law. She still lives with Kelly and says she’s doing fine, despite her parents telling the police that she is “being held against her will” in what they call a “cult.” Three former members of Kelly’s inner circle — Cheryl Mack, Kitti Jones, and Asante McGee — provided details supporting the parents’ worst fears. They said six women live in properties rented by Kelly in Chicago and the Atlanta suburbs, and he controls every aspect of their lives: dictating what they eat, how they dress, when they bathe, when they sleep, and how they engage in sexual encounters that he records. The last time J. saw her daughter was Dec. 1, 2016. “It was as if she was brainwashed. [She] looked like a prisoner — it was horrible,” she said. “I hugged her and hugged her. But she just kept saying she’s in love and [Kelly] is the one who cares for her. I don’t know what to do. I hope that if I get her back, I can get her treatment for victims of cults. They can reprogram her. But I wish I could have stopped it from happening.” J. and Tim said they have only heard from their daughter twice since they last saw her. They got a one-sentence text from her on Christmas Day: “I hate Christmas has to be this way this year.” And J. received another text on May 14: “Happy Mother’s Day from me and Rob.”\n\nVallery Jean / FilmMagic R. Kelly performing at the James L. Knight Center on Oct. 17, 2013, in Miami.\n\nKelly has sold nearly 60 million albums during his 25-year career, and though his relevance is fading somewhat from the heyday of “I Believe I Can Fly” and “Trapped in the Closet,” he remains a major star in high demand for concerts, endorsements, television and radio appearances, and glossy magazine profiles. When he’s not performing, Kelly splits his time between his suburban Atlanta home and Trump Tower in Chicago. Extensive interviews with Mack, Jones, and McGee and a review of legal documents by BuzzFeed News paint a picture of what Kelly’s life offstage is like today.\n\nThe women in Kelly’s entourage initially think “This is R. Kelly, I’m going to live a lavish lifestyle,” said Mack, who worked as Kelly’s personal assistant for a year and a half starting in 2013 and has remained in touch with some members of his inner circle. “No. You have to ask for food. You have to ask to go use the bathroom. … [Kelly] is a master at mind control. ... He is a puppet master.”\n\n“He is a puppet master.\"\n\nJones and McGee both said they lived with Kelly and had sexual relationships with the star at different times over the past five years before leaving. Their documentation of this time is limited, however, as they said Kelly controlled their phone and social media use while they were under his roof, and they were not allowed to take photos with Kelly or of the rooms where they were living. According to Mack, Jones, and McGee, the women living in Kelly’s Duluth, Georgia, “guest house” or his Chicago recording studio last summer included: A 31-year-old “den mother” who “trained” newcomers on how Kelly liked to be pleasured sexually. She had been best friends since high school with the girl in the videotape for which Kelly was tried in 2008. She recently parted ways with Kelly, these sources say.\n\nA 25-year-old woman who also has been part of Kelly’s scene for seven years.\n\nA recent arrival, a 19-year-old model who has been photographed in public with Kelly and named on music gossip websites — a rarity among the women in his circle.\n\nAn Atlanta songwriter who began her relationship with Kelly around 2009, when she was 19. (She is now 26.)\n\nAnd an 18-year-old singer from Polk County, Florida. Mack said the Florida singer is Kelly’s “favorite — his number-one girl.” Mack, Jones, and McGee claim that women who live with Kelly, who he calls his “babies,” are required to call him “Daddy” and must ask his permission to leave the Chicago recording studio or their assigned rooms in the “guest house” Kelly rents near his own rented mansion in suburban Atlanta. A black SUV with a burly driver behind the wheel is almost always parked outside both locations. Kelly confiscates the women’s cell phones, they said, so they cannot contact their friends and family; he gives them new phones that they are only allowed to use to contact him or others with his permission. Kelly films his sexual activities, McGee and Jones said, and shows the videos to men in his circle. Mack, the star’s former personal assistant, said Kelly almost always tells the women to dress in jogging suits because “he doesn’t want their figures to be exposed; he doesn’t want them to look appealing.” She said when other men are in the same room, Kelly “would make the girls turn around and face the wall in their jogging suits because he doesn’t want them to be looked at by anyone else.” If the women break any of Kelly’s “rules,” Mack and Jones said, he punishes them physically and verbally. For example, Jones claimed that Kelly held her against a tree and slapped her outside of a Subway sandwich shop in spring 2013 because she had been too friendly with the male cashier there. McGee said she never saw Kelly hit anybody, but also said he was running a “cult” and manipulated her emotionally and sexually. “R. Kelly is the sweetest person you will ever want to meet,” McGee said. “But Robert is the devil.”\n\nOf course, the law says that consenting adults may take part in any relationship they want, no matter how nontraditional. Welfare checks by police in both Illinois and Georgia in the past year didn’t lead to any charges; in January, the aspiring singer from Georgia told Cook County police she was “fine and did not want to be bothered.”\n\nAnd all of the women in Kelly’s inner circle are of legal age — the age of consent is 17 in Illinois and 16 in Georgia — despite Kelly’s history of allegations against him regarding his sexual conduct with women. He was last tried in 2008 in Illinois, where he was acquitted on 14 charges of making child pornography. The case, which took a record six and a half years to go to trial in Chicago, focused only on a single videotape that prosecutors alleged showed him having sex with a 14-year-old girl. (While he was a reporter at the Chicago Sun-Times, this reporter received the tape anonymously and turned it over to the police; called by Kelly's attorneys to testify, he took the Fifth Amendment rather than revealing sources.) The trial, however, excluded claims made by girls or their parents that alleged Kelly regularly abused his position of fame and influence to pursue illegal sexual relationships with underage girls — which has also been the subject of a dozen or more civil lawsuits against Kelly that were settled out of court with cash payments from Kelly. The girls signed nondisclosure agreements when they accepted the payments. Also excluded was evidence of Kelly’s marriage in 1994 to his then-15-year-old protégé, Aaliyah, for whom he wrote the album Age Ain’t Nothing But a Number. Chicago attorney Susan E. Loggans declined to say how many settlements she has negotiated with Kelly before lawsuits were ever filed, but she said they were “numerous,” and recently included one for a 17-year-old aspiring singer from Chicago’s West Side who is said to have been part of Kelly’s inner circle. Loggans gave no other details, citing attorney-client privilege and the terms of the settlement. Kelly also has been sued by other attorneys representing women over the age of consent in their respective states. In 2002, an Illinois lawsuit was filed by Montina Woods, a dancer who toured with Kelly’s friend Ronald Isley, in which Woods claimed she was unknowingly recorded by Kelly during sex. (Kelly eventually settled the suit, paying Woods an undisclosed sum.) And on April 21, a Mississippi lawsuit was filed by Hinds County sheriff’s deputy Kenny Bryant over an alleged affair between Kelly and Bryant’s wife. The music industry has a history of stars using their fame to gain the trust of young women — and their parents — who expect professional relationships but end up in sexual ones. But numerous sources, including women who left his inner circle, made on-the-record allegations suggesting ongoing mental and physical abuse of several women in Kelly’s entourage far beyond that of the groupie culture. For two decades, Kelly has been accused of a similar pattern of mistreating women — some have called it “predation” — but because of his acquittal on the child-porn charges and the nondisclosure agreements in his numerous civil cases, the charges have remained in the realm of gossip instead of derailing his career. Major record companies, television shows, and other stars continue to work with Kelly. Lady Gaga recorded the duet “Do What U Want” with Kelly in 2013, Lil Wayne, Ty Dolla Sign, and Juicy J made cameos on Kelly’s 2015 album The Buffet, and he performed on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon last December. He recently starred in a digital campaign for Alexander Wang. “I got trapped,” said former insider Jones. “I had people telling me I was an idiot. But it took me a long time to realize they were right, and I’m talking now because I hope I can help some of these other girls.”\n\nAndrew Gill/WBEZ Security cameras seen on R. Kelly's Chicago recording studio.\n\nAfter her backstage visit with Kelly in Indio, California, the aspiring singer from Georgia began secretly talking with Kelly on her cell phone, her mother said. “As far as I know, we weren’t talking to [Kelly] anymore,” J. said. “Or at least I wasn’t talking to him anymore.” In June 2015, J. and Tim said, their daughter lied to them about taking a weekend trip to visit a Georgia university. Instead, Mack arranged for her to fly to Oklahoma City, where Kelly was performing. After the show, she had sex with Kelly for the first time, she later told her parents and at least two friends, including a record producer who goes by the stage name TONE. As the Georgia singer and Kelly became closer, TONE recalled her saying she was frustrated with Kelly. She thought every time she tried to bring up her music career Kelly changed the topic to sex — and she wanted proof. So TONE and the woman decided to secretly record a phone conversation between her and Kelly. BuzzFeed News was later given a copy of the recording. On the tape, it’s not just what Kelly said that shows his pattern of behavior with the women close to him. It's how he said it, which is immediately clear from listening to the audio. “I miss my baby,” Kelly told the woman, before asking her what she was wearing. After she replied, he told her: “I want you to get in the habit of telling me what color panties you got on every day,” he instructed repeatedly, revealing in his own words the early stages of their power dynamic and the demands her parents say have become criminal. When she tried to turn the conversation to a song she was working on, however, Kelly seemed less engaged.\n\nYour browser does not support the audio tag.\n\n“Hello?” she asked him at one point, to make sure he was still listening.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Kelly changed the subject. “I’m more interested in developing you. Songs are not an issue. We can always do a hit song.”\n\nYour browser does not support the audio tag.\n\nIn June 2016, the daughter enrolled for summer classes at Georgia Gwinnett College in Lawrenceville and began living in the dorms. Her roommate at the school, who is being identified by the initials T.S. to avoid retaliation, told BuzzFeed News that, at first, she did not believe her new friend really knew R. Kelly. But, T.S. said, the Georgia woman would often call the superstar and put him on speakerphone during their explicit sexual conversations.\n\nThe Georgia woman also began visiting Kelly at his homes in nearby Duluth and sometimes traveled with him to Chicago, according to T.S. She recalled the woman telling her that Kelly took away her cell phone and replaced it with a new one, with instructions that she should only use it to communicate with him and needed to obtain his permission to use it to communicate with others.\n\n“I’m more interested in developing you. Songs are not an issue. We can always do a hit song.”\n\nT.S. also recalled the woman telling her that one time, Kelly sent a cab to pick up the women at his guest house and bring them to a club where he would meet them. The Georgia woman told her roommate that she laughed when the cab driver told a joke, and one of the other women in the cab texted Kelly to report this violation of his “rules.” When the Georgia woman arrived at the club, T.S. said, Kelly “bent her over and he whupped her behind because she laughed at the cab driver, who happened to be a man.” By the middle of the 2016 fall semester, the Georgia woman’s appearance started to change: She began losing weight, and she cropped her long hair short, permed what was left, and dyed it blonde, said her parents and the former roommate. T.S. recalled her friend telling her that’s how Kelly liked her hair to look. The Georgia woman eventually began skipping all of her classes, and she did not show up to take her finals in mid-December. Her parents confirmed the school considers her a student who is “no longer in good standing.” She had already broken off all contact with her mother and father before she started skipping school. “My calls were all forwarded to voicemail,” J. said. In the middle of the fall semester, during their quest to bring their daughter home, J. said she called the new cell phone Kelly had given her daughter, who broke one of Kelly’s “rules” by texting her parents from the phone to say she was fine. J. said Kelly himself got on the phone after the daughter picked up and denied anything was wrong.\n\nNicole Craine Two of R. Kelly's rental properties near Atlanta.\n\nThe parents filed a missing persons report with the Gwinnett College campus police. A spokeswoman for the school confirmed the report and the case number, but said that when an investigator called the parents and learned that they knew their daughter was with Kelly in his suburban Atlanta homes no action could be taken. Their daughter was not technically missing, and at 21, she is of legal age to do what she wants, campus police said. The last time her parents saw her was in December 2016. “What we really wanted to do was an intervention,” J. said, but her daughter would not listen. On Dec. 27, 2016, J. and Tim requested that the Johns Creek Police Department, which is responsible for the section of Duluth where Kelly rents the two houses, perform a well-being check on their daughter at the guest house. The police report obtained by BuzzFeed News said J. believes her daughter is part of the R. Kelly “cult” and that he is “abusive and is controlling her daughter.” When police arrived, the report noted, the “door [was] open, house clear, no one there.” No further action was taken.\n\n“What we really wanted to do was an intervention.”\n\nA month later, the Cook County Sheriff’s police performed a well-being check in Chicago. The Georgia singer told officers she was “fine and did not want to be bothered with her parents because her father was threatening people,” according to the police report. (Tim denied this.) She told officers she instead keeps in touch with her grandmother, who she calls Nana. When reached by BuzzFeed News, Nana said that she had spoken to her granddaughter by phone only two or three times since December, most recently on July 11. She said her granddaughter emphasized that she’s an adult in a consensual relationship with Kelly, and was mad at her parents for intervening. In text messages reviewed by BuzzFeed News, the granddaughter said she thought her parents were trying to ruin Kelly’s career. Despite her granddaughter’s insistence, “I’m gravely concerned about her,” Nana said, echoing J.’s belief that she is being held against her will. If she could talk to Kelly today, Nana said, “I would tell R. Kelly to send my granddaughter home. He knows it’s not right and he would not want anybody doing this to his daughter.” Multiple attempts by BuzzFeed News to reach the Georgia woman on her Kelly-issued cell phone were unsuccessful. J. and Tim said they even reached out to the FBI about their daughter and spent hours being interviewed by an agent. Special Agent Stephen Emmett, an FBI spokesperson in Georgia, said the bureau’s policy is to neither confirm nor deny investigations into specific people or matters. But the parents are hopeful that perhaps federal law enforcement can help where local police have not. “It’s not about my daughter, per se. It’s about all the girls,” Tim said. “It’s about my daughter, and I understand that. But the abuse that my daughter is actually enduring, nobody should go through.”\n\nNam Y. Huh / Associated Press Kelly leaving the Cook County Criminal Court Building on June 13, 2008, after a jury found him not guilty on all counts in his child pornography trial.\n\nTwo other parents are fighting to get their daughter back. The parents of an aspiring professional singer from Florida said their daughter met Kelly when she was 17 years old, and she moved into one of his rental properties once she was over the age of legal consent. (BuzzFeed News verified their identities and full names, but is withholding the alleged victim's full name and her parents' last name to protect her privacy. Her mother asked to be called by her middle name, Theresa, for the same reason.) Theresa said she initially let her daughter spend time with Kelly because it was “supposed to be a music relationship.” She now regrets that decision. “My thing was I trusted. I have never been in the music industry before, ever,” Theresa said. “He is a lyrical genius — he is R. Kelly! And the fact is he went to court, he was never found guilty — he was acquitted — and we were led to believe there was no truth in it. Now I got all of these people asking about why my daughter is there, telling me, ‘All of that, the charges against Kelly, was true.’ Well, how come you didn’t tell me that before?” The Florida singer first met Kelly when her parents took her to see him perform at Funk Fest in Orlando on April 18, 2015.\n\n“The fact is he went to court, he was never found guilty — he was acquitted — and we were led to believe there was no truth in it.\"\n\n“During the show, they were pulling people out of the audience,” Theresa said. “A guy said, ‘Oh yeah, her.’ He pulled her up onstage.” After the show, a member of Kelly’s entourage gave the star’s phone number to the then-17-year-old high school senior, Theresa said. “We called, but he wasn’t answering, so we left it alone,” she said. “Then I guess he must have got back later on or texted her later on.” As with the Georgia woman, the relationship between Kelly and the Florida woman developed over phone calls and text messages that were kept secret from her family, the parents said. “And then one day we were looking for her because she should’ve been coming home from school,” Theresa said. “Then finally we get a text message saying that she’s OK, that she had met up with R. Kelly in his hotel. And I’m like, ‘You met up with R. Kelly at his hotel?’” Theresa and her husband, Angelo, said they rushed to the hotel and called the police, who advised them to deal with hotel security. Their daughter finally came down to see them, they said, but Kelly refused to talk with them. After the incident at the hotel, the Florida teen “was only [supposed to be] talking to him when one of us was around,” Theresa said. “We needed to make sure it was about music, because he was going to mentor her,” she said. “And then from there he wanted her to travel with him so she could see how the music game really was. ... We thought it could be an opportunity, and that she was going to be with a guardian — a female guardian that would keep an eye on her.” But that may have been wishful thinking. Soon enough, the Florida singer was living with Kelly. Angelo said he initially received short text messages from his daughter every few weeks saying she was fine and the parents should not worry or try to contact her. Those have stopped. McGee, one of the women who left Kelly, said the Florida woman is “head over heels” for Kelly. And McGee said Kelly is “obsessed” with the Florida woman, noting that he “would go into the kitchen and cook for her.” But McGee’s feelings about the Florida woman were nuanced. “I have a 17-year-old daughter myself,” she said. “When I saw [the Florida singer] with him, it took me back. This could be my daughter. I just knew that it was not right and I just couldn’t understand what a man almost 50 is doing having sex with someone the same age as his daughter. That’s when I realized it was more of a mind-control thing.” McGee also said she witnessed Kelly punish the aspiring Florida singer for breaking his “rules.”\n\n“I just couldn’t understand what a man almost 50 is doing having sex with someone the same age as his daughter.”\n\n“He left [the Florida woman] on the [tour] bus for, like, three days and she was not allowed to come out,” McGee said. “He said she didn’t do her homework — that’s why she was punished — which was very confusing, because she had just graduated [high school] over the summer.” Multiple attempts by BuzzFeed News to reach the Florida woman on her Kelly-issued cell phone were unsuccessful. Theresa said she is frustrated that lawyers and police have said they cannot help, and she fears that even if the relationship ends, she may not get her daughter back. On Dec. 24, 1996, Kelly was sued for $10 million by Tiffany “Tia” Hawkins, an aspiring singer and then–high school student in Chicago, who claimed she met the star when he lectured her choir class. According to the lawsuit, Hawkins began having sex with Kelly in 1991, when she was 15 and he was 24. The relationship ended in December 1994, when she was 18, the court documents state; distraught, she slit her wrists in an attempt to kill herself. “I desperately want my daughter back but I’m not [sure] what will [be] the repercussions if she doesn’t come willingly,” Theresa said. “These girls think this man loves them. Matters of the heart are a touchy subject.” The parents said they’ve tried numerous other tactics to bring their daughter home. In August 2015, the daughter texted Angelo that she was in Chicago with Kelly, the parents said. On Aug. 26, 2015, they sent their older daughter to Kelly’s recording studio to check on her sister, according to her parents. Kelly and men in his entourage allegedly got involved in an altercation with the older sister when she tried to take her younger sister away, said the parents, who claimed the star and the other men pushed, shoved, and hit the older sister. A police report obtained by BuzzFeed News indicated that one person allegedly struck the Florida singer’s sister in her face, but she did not seek medical attention. The case is classified as a simple battery and nobody has been arrested, according to the report, which said the investigation was initially suspended until a detective could contact the victim. A supplementary report was filed more than a year later, on Jan. 18, 2017. “I have not talked to my daughter in more than a year,” Theresa said, adding she has left countless texts and voicemail messages that have not yet received a response. “We’ve had deaths in the family, birthdays, and I haven’t heard from her and she hasn’t been here for any of it. I didn’t even hear from her on Mother’s Day. All I want to do is bring her home.” On Friday, July 14, after Kelly and the Florida woman had been asked for comment on this story, Angelo said he got a surprise phone call from his daughter, who invited him to come to see Kelly perform in Indiana on Saturday. Wary of Kelly’s motivations, Angelo said he declined the invitation. He also is angry over the other surprise news from his daughter: She said Kelly had recently paid for her to have breast enhancement surgery. “I am beyond furious,” Angelo said. “I said to her, ‘How could you do this? What the hell were you thinking? What if you died on the operating table?’ I don’t even know what we can do anymore. I just know we got to get her home.\"\n\nRick Kern / WireImage R. Kelly performing at Bass Concert Hall on March 3 in Austin.\n\nKelly has long maintained his innocence on allegations of underage sex, and in recent interviews he has either persistently dodged questions about his past behavior or stormed off when he was unable to do that. Multiple attempts to reach Kelly were unsuccessful. Kelly’s RCA Records publicist Theola Borden, who was promoted to senior vice president of publicity for the label in 2014, did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls requesting comment.\n\n“I suppose that is the price of fame. Like all of us, Mr. Kelly deserves a personal life.”",

        "text": "As the R&B legend tours the country this summer, parents have told police that R. Kelly is keeping women against their will in an abusive \"cult\" that's tearing families apart. Three former members of Kelly’s inner circle told BuzzFeed News similar stories.\n\nBackstage at the Fantasy Springs Resort Casino in Indio, California, on May 23, 2015, J. was thrilled that her 19-year-old daughter’s music career was going to make a major leap forward from recording demos and performing at talent shows to the chance of stardom — thanks to the help of an R&B superstar.\n\n“When we got to go backstage with R. Kelly, we stayed there over two hours,” said J. “One-on-one with just me and my daughter and him. We went back to talk about the music. He listened to her CD. He was going to help her with her CD, and I was really impressed with him at first, because I have always been an R. Kelly fan.” J. said that Robert “R.” Kelly, who turned 50 in January, met her daughter backstage at a concert in Atlanta earlier that month. Soon enough, he’d invited her to fly out to the Indio concert on his dime. J. said she’d heard about past sexual misconduct accusations against Kelly, but wasn’t overly worried. She is a fiercely devoted stage mom — she and her husband of 22 years, Tim, a car dealer, had moved from Memphis to Atlanta to help their eldest child’s career — and was confident she could protect her daughter. “In the back of our minds, we were thinking [my daughter] could be around him if I was with her,” J. said. “It didn’t really hit home. Even with the Aaliyah situation, now that I think about it, ‘Age Ain’t Nothing But a Number’ ... but you don’t think about that. You grew up with the song, and you like the song.” Two years later, J. and Tim are in a desperate fight to bring their daughter home. (BuzzFeed News verified their identities and full names in public records, but is withholding the alleged victim's full name and her parents' last name to protect her privacy.)\n\n“It was as if she was brainwashed.”\n\nAs part of their efforts, the mother closed her businesses, became a relentless amateur detective, and shared her findings with the FBI and police in two states. But their daughter isn’t a missing person — at least not in the eyes of the law. She still lives with Kelly and says she’s doing fine, despite her parents telling the police that she is “being held against her will” in what they call a “cult.” Three former members of Kelly’s inner circle — Cheryl Mack, Kitti Jones, and Asante McGee — provided details supporting the parents’ worst fears. They said six women live in properties rented by Kelly in Chicago and the Atlanta suburbs, and he controls every aspect of their lives: dictating what they eat, how they dress, when they bathe, when they sleep, and how they engage in sexual encounters that he records. The last time J. saw her daughter was Dec. 1, 2016. “It was as if she was brainwashed. [She] looked like a prisoner — it was horrible,” she said. “I hugged her and hugged her. But she just kept saying she’s in love and [Kelly] is the one who cares for her. I don’t know what to do. I hope that if I get her back, I can get her treatment for victims of cults. They can reprogram her. But I wish I could have stopped it from happening.” J. and Tim said they have only heard from their daughter twice since they last saw her. They got a one-sentence text from her on Christmas Day: “I hate Christmas has to be this way this year.” And J. received another text on May 14: “Happy Mother’s Day from me and Rob.”\n\nVallery Jean / FilmMagic R. Kelly performing at the James L. Knight Center on Oct. 17, 2013, in Miami.\n\nKelly has sold nearly 60 million albums during his 25-year career, and though his relevance is fading somewhat from the heyday of “I Believe I Can Fly” and “Trapped in the Closet,” he remains a major star in high demand for concerts, endorsements, television and radio appearances, and glossy magazine profiles. When he’s not performing, Kelly splits his time between his suburban Atlanta home and Trump Tower in Chicago. Extensive interviews with Mack, Jones, and McGee and a review of legal documents by BuzzFeed News paint a picture of what Kelly’s life offstage is like today.\n\nThe women in Kelly’s entourage initially think “This is R. Kelly, I’m going to live a lavish lifestyle,” said Mack, who worked as Kelly’s personal assistant for a year and a half starting in 2013 and has remained in touch with some members of his inner circle. “No. You have to ask for food. You have to ask to go use the bathroom. … [Kelly] is a master at mind control. ... He is a puppet master.”\n\n“He is a puppet master.\"\n\nJones and McGee both said they lived with Kelly and had sexual relationships with the star at different times over the past five years before leaving. Their documentation of this time is limited, however, as they said Kelly controlled their phone and social media use while they were under his roof, and they were not allowed to take photos with Kelly or of the rooms where they were living. According to Mack, Jones, and McGee, the women living in Kelly’s Duluth, Georgia, “guest house” or his Chicago recording studio last summer included: A 31-year-old “den mother” who “trained” newcomers on how Kelly liked to be pleasured sexually. She had been best friends since high school with the girl in the videotape for which Kelly was tried in 2008. She recently parted ways with Kelly, these sources say.\n\nA 25-year-old woman who also has been part of Kelly’s scene for seven years.\n\nA recent arrival, a 19-year-old model who has been photographed in public with Kelly and named on music gossip websites — a rarity among the women in his circle.\n\nAn Atlanta songwriter who began her relationship with Kelly around 2009, when she was 19. (She is now 26.)\n\nAnd an 18-year-old singer from Polk County, Florida. Mack said the Florida singer is Kelly’s “favorite — his number-one girl.” Mack, Jones, and McGee claim that women who live with Kelly, who he calls his “babies,” are required to call him “Daddy” and must ask his permission to leave the Chicago recording studio or their assigned rooms in the “guest house” Kelly rents near his own rented mansion in suburban Atlanta. A black SUV with a burly driver behind the wheel is almost always parked outside both locations. Kelly confiscates the women’s cell phones, they said, so they cannot contact their friends and family; he gives them new phones that they are only allowed to use to contact him or others with his permission. Kelly films his sexual activities, McGee and Jones said, and shows the videos to men in his circle. Mack, the star’s former personal assistant, said Kelly almost always tells the women to dress in jogging suits because “he doesn’t want their figures to be exposed; he doesn’t want them to look appealing.” She said when other men are in the same room, Kelly “would make the girls turn around and face the wall in their jogging suits because he doesn’t want them to be looked at by anyone else.” If the women break any of Kelly’s “rules,” Mack and Jones said, he punishes them physically and verbally. For example, Jones claimed that Kelly held her against a tree and slapped her outside of a Subway sandwich shop in spring 2013 because she had been too friendly with the male cashier there. McGee said she never saw Kelly hit anybody, but also said he was running a “cult” and manipulated her emotionally and sexually. “R. Kelly is the sweetest person you will ever want to meet,” McGee said. “But Robert is the devil.”\n\nOf course, the law says that consenting adults may take part in any relationship they want, no matter how nontraditional. Welfare checks by police in both Illinois and Georgia in the past year didn’t lead to any charges; in January, the aspiring singer from Georgia told Cook County police she was “fine and did not want to be bothered.”\n\nAnd all of the women in Kelly’s inner circle are of legal age — the age of consent is 17 in Illinois and 16 in Georgia — despite Kelly’s history of allegations against him regarding his sexual conduct with women. He was last tried in 2008 in Illinois, where he was acquitted on 14 charges of making child pornography. The case, which took a record six and a half years to go to trial in Chicago, focused only on a single videotape that prosecutors alleged showed him having sex with a 14-year-old girl. (While he was a reporter at the Chicago Sun-Times, this reporter received the tape anonymously and turned it over to the police; called by Kelly's attorneys to testify, he took the Fifth Amendment rather than revealing sources.) The trial, however, excluded claims made by girls or their parents that alleged Kelly regularly abused his position of fame and influence to pursue illegal sexual relationships with underage girls — which has also been the subject of a dozen or more civil lawsuits against Kelly that were settled out of court with cash payments from Kelly. The girls signed nondisclosure agreements when they accepted the payments. Also excluded was evidence of Kelly’s marriage in 1994 to his then-15-year-old protégé, Aaliyah, for whom he wrote the album Age Ain’t Nothing But a Number. Chicago attorney Susan E. Loggans declined to say how many settlements she has negotiated with Kelly before lawsuits were ever filed, but she said they were “numerous,” and recently included one for a 17-year-old aspiring singer from Chicago’s West Side who is said to have been part of Kelly’s inner circle. Loggans gave no other details, citing attorney-client privilege and the terms of the settlement. Kelly also has been sued by other attorneys representing women over the age of consent in their respective states. In 2002, an Illinois lawsuit was filed by Montina Woods, a dancer who toured with Kelly’s friend Ronald Isley, in which Woods claimed she was unknowingly recorded by Kelly during sex. (Kelly eventually settled the suit, paying Woods an undisclosed sum.) And on April 21, a Mississippi lawsuit was filed by Hinds County sheriff’s deputy Kenny Bryant over an alleged affair between Kelly and Bryant’s wife. The music industry has a history of stars using their fame to gain the trust of young women — and their parents — who expect professional relationships but end up in sexual ones. But numerous sources, including women who left his inner circle, made on-the-record allegations suggesting ongoing mental and physical abuse of several women in Kelly’s entourage far beyond that of the groupie culture. For two decades, Kelly has been accused of a similar pattern of mistreating women — some have called it “predation” — but because of his acquittal on the child-porn charges and the nondisclosure agreements in his numerous civil cases, the charges have remained in the realm of gossip instead of derailing his career. Major record companies, television shows, and other stars continue to work with Kelly. Lady Gaga recorded the duet “Do What U Want” with Kelly in 2013, Lil Wayne, Ty Dolla Sign, and Juicy J made cameos on Kelly’s 2015 album The Buffet, and he performed on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon last December. He recently starred in a digital campaign for Alexander Wang. “I got trapped,” said former insider Jones. “I had people telling me I was an idiot. But it took me a long time to realize they were right, and I’m talking now because I hope I can help some of these other girls.”\n\nAndrew Gill/WBEZ Security cameras seen on R. Kelly's Chicago recording studio.\n\nAfter her backstage visit with Kelly in Indio, California, the aspiring singer from Georgia began secretly talking with Kelly on her cell phone, her mother said. “As far as I know, we weren’t talking to [Kelly] anymore,” J. said. “Or at least I wasn’t talking to him anymore.” In June 2015, J. and Tim said, their daughter lied to them about taking a weekend trip to visit a Georgia university. Instead, Mack arranged for her to fly to Oklahoma City, where Kelly was performing. After the show, she had sex with Kelly for the first time, she later told her parents and at least two friends, including a record producer who goes by the stage name TONE. As the Georgia singer and Kelly became closer, TONE recalled her saying she was frustrated with Kelly. She thought every time she tried to bring up her music career Kelly changed the topic to sex — and she wanted proof. So TONE and the woman decided to secretly record a phone conversation between her and Kelly. BuzzFeed News was later given a copy of the recording. On the tape, it’s not just what Kelly said that shows his pattern of behavior with the women close to him. It's how he said it, which is immediately clear from listening to the audio. “I miss my baby,” Kelly told the woman, before asking her what she was wearing. After she replied, he told her: “I want you to get in the habit of telling me what color panties you got on every day,” he instructed repeatedly, revealing in his own words the early stages of their power dynamic and the demands her parents say have become criminal. When she tried to turn the conversation to a song she was working on, however, Kelly seemed less engaged.\n\nYour browser does not support the audio tag.\n\n“Hello?” she asked him at one point, to make sure he was still listening.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Kelly changed the subject. “I’m more interested in developing you. Songs are not an issue. We can always do a hit song.”\n\nYour browser does not support the audio tag.\n\nIn June 2016, the daughter enrolled for summer classes at Georgia Gwinnett College in Lawrenceville and began living in the dorms. Her roommate at the school, who is being identified by the initials T.S. to avoid retaliation, told BuzzFeed News that, at first, she did not believe her new friend really knew R. Kelly. But, T.S. said, the Georgia woman would often call the superstar and put him on speakerphone during their explicit sexual conversations.\n\nThe Georgia woman also began visiting Kelly at his homes in nearby Duluth and sometimes traveled with him to Chicago, according to T.S. She recalled the woman telling her that Kelly took away her cell phone and replaced it with a new one, with instructions that she should only use it to communicate with him and needed to obtain his permission to use it to communicate with others.\n\n“I’m more interested in developing you. Songs are not an issue. We can always do a hit song.”\n\nT.S. also recalled the woman telling her that one time, Kelly sent a cab to pick up the women at his guest house and bring them to a club where he would meet them. The Georgia woman told her roommate that she laughed when the cab driver told a joke, and one of the other women in the cab texted Kelly to report this violation of his “rules.” When the Georgia woman arrived at the club, T.S. said, Kelly “bent her over and he whupped her behind because she laughed at the cab driver, who happened to be a man.” By the middle of the 2016 fall semester, the Georgia woman’s appearance started to change: She began losing weight, and she cropped her long hair short, permed what was left, and dyed it blonde, said her parents and the former roommate. T.S. recalled her friend telling her that’s how Kelly liked her hair to look. The Georgia woman eventually began skipping all of her classes, and she did not show up to take her finals in mid-December. Her parents confirmed the school considers her a student who is “no longer in good standing.” She had already broken off all contact with her mother and father before she started skipping school. “My calls were all forwarded to voicemail,” J. said. In the middle of the fall semester, during their quest to bring their daughter home, J. said she called the new cell phone Kelly had given her daughter, who broke one of Kelly’s “rules” by texting her parents from the phone to say she was fine. J. said Kelly himself got on the phone after the daughter picked up and denied anything was wrong.\n\nNicole Craine Two of R. Kelly's rental properties near Atlanta.\n\nThe parents filed a missing persons report with the Gwinnett College campus police. A spokeswoman for the school confirmed the report and the case number, but said that when an investigator called the parents and learned that they knew their daughter was with Kelly in his suburban Atlanta homes no action could be taken. Their daughter was not technically missing, and at 21, she is of legal age to do what she wants, campus police said. The last time her parents saw her was in December 2016. “What we really wanted to do was an intervention,” J. said, but her daughter would not listen. On Dec. 27, 2016, J. and Tim requested that the Johns Creek Police Department, which is responsible for the section of Duluth where Kelly rents the two houses, perform a well-being check on their daughter at the guest house. The police report obtained by BuzzFeed News said J. believes her daughter is part of the R. Kelly “cult” and that he is “abusive and is controlling her daughter.” When police arrived, the report noted, the “door [was] open, house clear, no one there.” No further action was taken.\n\n“What we really wanted to do was an intervention.”\n\nA month later, the Cook County Sheriff’s police performed a well-being check in Chicago. The Georgia singer told officers she was “fine and did not want to be bothered with her parents because her father was threatening people,” according to the police report. (Tim denied this.) She told officers she instead keeps in touch with her grandmother, who she calls Nana. When reached by BuzzFeed News, Nana said that she had spoken to her granddaughter by phone only two or three times since December, most recently on July 11. She said her granddaughter emphasized that she’s an adult in a consensual relationship with Kelly, and was mad at her parents for intervening. In text messages reviewed by BuzzFeed News, the granddaughter said she thought her parents were trying to ruin Kelly’s career. Despite her granddaughter’s insistence, “I’m gravely concerned about her,” Nana said, echoing J.’s belief that she is being held against her will. If she could talk to Kelly today, Nana said, “I would tell R. Kelly to send my granddaughter home. He knows it’s not right and he would not want anybody doing this to his daughter.” Multiple attempts by BuzzFeed News to reach the Georgia woman on her Kelly-issued cell phone were unsuccessful. J. and Tim said they even reached out to the FBI about their daughter and spent hours being interviewed by an agent. Special Agent Stephen Emmett, an FBI spokesperson in Georgia, said the bureau’s policy is to neither confirm nor deny investigations into specific people or matters. But the parents are hopeful that perhaps federal law enforcement can help where local police have not. “It’s not about my daughter, per se. It’s about all the girls,” Tim said. “It’s about my daughter, and I understand that. But the abuse that my daughter is actually enduring, nobody should go through.”\n\nNam Y. Huh / Associated Press Kelly leaving the Cook County Criminal Court Building on June 13, 2008, after a jury found him not guilty on all counts in his child pornography trial.\n\nTwo other parents are fighting to get their daughter back. The parents of an aspiring professional singer from Florida said their daughter met Kelly when she was 17 years old, and she moved into one of his rental properties once she was over the age of legal consent. (BuzzFeed News verified their identities and full names, but is withholding the alleged victim's full name and her parents' last name to protect her privacy. Her mother asked to be called by her middle name, Theresa, for the same reason.) Theresa said she initially let her daughter spend time with Kelly because it was “supposed to be a music relationship.” She now regrets that decision. “My thing was I trusted. I have never been in the music industry before, ever,” Theresa said. “He is a lyrical genius — he is R. Kelly! And the fact is he went to court, he was never found guilty — he was acquitted — and we were led to believe there was no truth in it. Now I got all of these people asking about why my daughter is there, telling me, ‘All of that, the charges against Kelly, was true.’ Well, how come you didn’t tell me that before?” The Florida singer first met Kelly when her parents took her to see him perform at Funk Fest in Orlando on April 18, 2015.\n\n“The fact is he went to court, he was never found guilty — he was acquitted — and we were led to believe there was no truth in it.\"\n\n“During the show, they were pulling people out of the audience,” Theresa said. “A guy said, ‘Oh yeah, her.’ He pulled her up onstage.” After the show, a member of Kelly’s entourage gave the star’s phone number to the then-17-year-old high school senior, Theresa said. “We called, but he wasn’t answering, so we left it alone,” she said. “Then I guess he must have got back later on or texted her later on.” As with the Georgia woman, the relationship between Kelly and the Florida woman developed over phone calls and text messages that were kept secret from her family, the parents said. “And then one day we were looking for her because she should’ve been coming home from school,” Theresa said. “Then finally we get a text message saying that she’s OK, that she had met up with R. Kelly in his hotel. And I’m like, ‘You met up with R. Kelly at his hotel?’” Theresa and her husband, Angelo, said they rushed to the hotel and called the police, who advised them to deal with hotel security. Their daughter finally came down to see them, they said, but Kelly refused to talk with them. After the incident at the hotel, the Florida teen “was only [supposed to be] talking to him when one of us was around,” Theresa said. “We needed to make sure it was about music, because he was going to mentor her,” she said. “And then from there he wanted her to travel with him so she could see how the music game really was. ... We thought it could be an opportunity, and that she was going to be with a guardian — a female guardian that would keep an eye on her.” But that may have been wishful thinking. Soon enough, the Florida singer was living with Kelly. Angelo said he initially received short text messages from his daughter every few weeks saying she was fine and the parents should not worry or try to contact her. Those have stopped. McGee, one of the women who left Kelly, said the Florida woman is “head over heels” for Kelly. And McGee said Kelly is “obsessed” with the Florida woman, noting that he “would go into the kitchen and cook for her.” But McGee’s feelings about the Florida woman were nuanced. “I have a 17-year-old daughter myself,” she said. “When I saw [the Florida singer] with him, it took me back. This could be my daughter. I just knew that it was not right and I just couldn’t understand what a man almost 50 is doing having sex with someone the same age as his daughter. That’s when I realized it was more of a mind-control thing.” McGee also said she witnessed Kelly punish the aspiring Florida singer for breaking his “rules.”\n\n“I just couldn’t understand what a man almost 50 is doing having sex with someone the same age as his daughter.”\n\n“He left [the Florida woman] on the [tour] bus for, like, three days and she was not allowed to come out,” McGee said. “He said she didn’t do her homework — that’s why she was punished — which was very confusing, because she had just graduated [high school] over the summer.” Multiple attempts by BuzzFeed News to reach the Florida woman on her Kelly-issued cell phone were unsuccessful. Theresa said she is frustrated that lawyers and police have said they cannot help, and she fears that even if the relationship ends, she may not get her daughter back. On Dec. 24, 1996, Kelly was sued for $10 million by Tiffany “Tia” Hawkins, an aspiring singer and then–high school student in Chicago, who claimed she met the star when he lectured her choir class. According to the lawsuit, Hawkins began having sex with Kelly in 1991, when she was 15 and he was 24. The relationship ended in December 1994, when she was 18, the court documents state; distraught, she slit her wrists in an attempt to kill herself. “I desperately want my daughter back but I’m not [sure] what will [be] the repercussions if she doesn’t come willingly,” Theresa said. “These girls think this man loves them. Matters of the heart are a touchy subject.” The parents said they’ve tried numerous other tactics to bring their daughter home. In August 2015, the daughter texted Angelo that she was in Chicago with Kelly, the parents said. On Aug. 26, 2015, they sent their older daughter to Kelly’s recording studio to check on her sister, according to her parents. Kelly and men in his entourage allegedly got involved in an altercation with the older sister when she tried to take her younger sister away, said the parents, who claimed the star and the other men pushed, shoved, and hit the older sister. A police report obtained by BuzzFeed News indicated that one person allegedly struck the Florida singer’s sister in her face, but she did not seek medical attention. The case is classified as a simple battery and nobody has been arrested, according to the report, which said the investigation was initially suspended until a detective could contact the victim. A supplementary report was filed more than a year later, on Jan. 18, 2017. “I have not talked to my daughter in more than a year,” Theresa said, adding she has left countless texts and voicemail messages that have not yet received a response. “We’ve had deaths in the family, birthdays, and I haven’t heard from her and she hasn’t been here for any of it. I didn’t even hear from her on Mother’s Day. All I want to do is bring her home.” On Friday, July 14, after Kelly and the Florida woman had been asked for comment on this story, Angelo said he got a surprise phone call from his daughter, who invited him to come to see Kelly perform in Indiana on Saturday. Wary of Kelly’s motivations, Angelo said he declined the invitation. He also is angry over the other surprise news from his daughter: She said Kelly had recently paid for her to have breast enhancement surgery. “I am beyond furious,” Angelo said. “I said to her, ‘How could you do this? What the hell were you thinking? What if you died on the operating table?’ I don’t even know what we can do anymore. I just know we got to get her home.\"\n\nRick Kern / WireImage R. Kelly performing at Bass Concert Hall on March 3 in Austin.\n\nKelly has long maintained his innocence on allegations of underage sex, and in recent interviews he has either persistently dodged questions about his past behavior or stormed off when he was unable to do that. Multiple attempts to reach Kelly were unsuccessful. Kelly’s RCA Records publicist Theola Borden, who was promoted to senior vice president of publicity for the label in 2014, did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls requesting comment.\n\n“I suppose that is the price of fame.

        "text": "As the R&B legend tours the country this summer, parents have told police that R. Kelly is keeping women against their will in an abusive \"cult\" that's tearing families apart. Three former members of Kelly’s inner circle told BuzzFeed News similar stories.\n\nBackstage at the Fantasy Springs Resort Casino in Indio, California, on May 23, 2015, J. was thrilled that her 19-year-old daughter’s music career was going to make a major leap forward from recording demos and performing at talent shows to the chance of stardom — thanks to the help of an R&B superstar.\n\n“When we got to go backstage with R. Kelly, we stayed there over two hours,” said J. “One-on-one with just me and my daughter and him. We went back to talk about the music. He listened to her CD. He was going to help her with her CD, and I was really impressed with him at first, because I have always been an R. Kelly fan.” J. said that Robert “R.” Kelly, who turned 50 in January, met her daughter backstage at a concert in Atlanta earlier that month. Soon enough, he’d invited her to fly out to the Indio concert on his dime. J. said she’d heard about past sexual misconduct accusations against Kelly, but wasn’t overly worried. She is a fiercely devoted stage mom — she and her husband of 22 years, Tim, a car dealer, had moved from Memphis to Atlanta to help their eldest child’s career — and was confident she could protect her daughter. “In the back of our minds, we were thinking [my daughter] could be around him if I was with her,” J. said. “It didn’t really hit home. Even with the Aaliyah situation, now that I think about it, ‘Age Ain’t Nothing But a Number’ ... but you don’t think about that. You grew up with the song, and you like the song.” Two years later, J. and Tim are in a desperate fight to bring their daughter home. (BuzzFeed News verified their identities and full names in public records, but is withholding the alleged victim's full name and her parents' last name to protect her privacy.)\n\n“It was as if she was brainwashed.”\n\nAs part of their efforts, the mother closed her businesses, became a relentless amateur detective, and shared her findings with the FBI and police in two states. But their daughter isn’t a missing person — at least not in the eyes of the law. She still lives with Kelly and says she’s doing fine, despite her parents telling the police that she is “being held against her will” in what they call a “cult.” Three former members of Kelly’s inner circle — Cheryl Mack, Kitti Jones, and Asante McGee — provided details supporting the parents’ worst fears. They said six women live in properties rented by Kelly in Chicago and the Atlanta suburbs, and he controls every aspect of their lives: dictating what they eat, how they dress, when they bathe, when they sleep, and how they engage in sexual encounters that he records. The last time J. saw her daughter was Dec. 1, 2016. “It was as if she was brainwashed. [She] looked like a prisoner — it was horrible,” she said. “I hugged her and hugged her. But she just kept saying she’s in love and [Kelly] is the one who cares for her. I don’t know what to do. I hope that if I get her back, I can get her treatment for victims of cults. They can reprogram her. But I wish I could have stopped it from happening.” J. and Tim said they have only heard from their daughter twice since they last saw her. They got a one-sentence text from her on Christmas Day: “I hate Christmas has to be this way this year.” And J. received another text on May 14: “Happy Mother’s Day from me and Rob.”\n\nVallery Jean / FilmMagic R. Kelly performing at the James L. Knight Center on Oct. 17, 2013, in Miami.\n\nKelly has sold nearly 60 million albums during his 25-year career, and though his relevance is fading somewhat from the heyday of “I Believe I Can Fly” and “Trapped in the Closet,” he remains a major star in high demand for concerts, endorsements, television and radio appearances, and glossy magazine profiles. When he’s not performing, Kelly splits his time between his suburban Atlanta home and Trump Tower in Chicago. Extensive interviews with Mack, Jones, and McGee and a review of legal documents by BuzzFeed News paint a picture of what Kelly’s life offstage is like today.\n\nThe women in Kelly’s entourage initially think “This is R. Kelly, I’m going to live a lavish lifestyle,” said Mack, who worked as Kelly’s personal assistant for a year and a half starting in 2013 and has remained in touch with some members of his inner circle. “No. You have to ask for food. You have to ask to go use the bathroom. … [Kelly] is a master at mind control. ... He is a puppet master.”\n\n“He is a puppet master.\"\n\nJones and McGee both said they lived with Kelly and had sexual relationships with the star at different times over the past five years before leaving. Their documentation of this time is limited, however, as they said Kelly controlled their phone and social media use while they were under his roof, and they were not allowed to take photos with Kelly or of the rooms where they were living. According to Mack, Jones, and McGee, the women living in Kelly’s Duluth, Georgia, “guest house” or his Chicago recording studio last summer included: A 31-year-old “den mother” who “trained” newcomers on how Kelly liked to be pleasured sexually. She had been best friends since high school with the girl in the videotape for which Kelly was tried in 2008. She recently parted ways with Kelly, these sources say.\n\nA 25-year-old woman who also has been part of Kelly’s scene for seven years.\n\nA recent arrival, a 19-year-old model who has been photographed in public with Kelly and named on music gossip websites — a rarity among the women in his circle.\n\nAn Atlanta songwriter who began her relationship with Kelly around 2009, when she was 19. (She is now 26.)\n\nAnd an 18-year-old singer from Polk County, Florida. Mack said the Florida singer is Kelly’s “favorite — his number-one girl.” Mack, Jones, and McGee claim that women who live with Kelly, who he calls his “babies,” are required to call him “Daddy” and must ask his permission to leave the Chicago recording studio or their assigned rooms in the “guest house” Kelly rents near his own rented mansion in suburban Atlanta. A black SUV with a burly driver behind the wheel is almost always parked outside both locations. Kelly confiscates the women’s cell phones, they said, so they cannot contact their friends and family; he gives them new phones that they are only allowed to use to contact him or others with his permission. Kelly films his sexual activities, McGee and Jones said, and shows the videos to men in his circle. Mack, the star’s former personal assistant, said Kelly almost always tells the women to dress in jogging suits because “he doesn’t want their figures to be exposed; he doesn’t want them to look appealing.” She said when other men are in the same room, Kelly “would make the girls turn around and face the wall in their jogging suits because he doesn’t want them to be looked at by anyone else.” If the women break any of Kelly’s “rules,” Mack and Jones said, he punishes them physically and verbally. For example, Jones claimed that Kelly held her against a tree and slapped her outside of a Subway sandwich shop in spring 2013 because she had been too friendly with the male cashier there. McGee said she never saw Kelly hit anybody, but also said he was running a “cult” and manipulated her emotionally and sexually. “R. Kelly is the sweetest person you will ever want to meet,” McGee said. “But Robert is the devil.”\n\nOf course, the law says that consenting adults may take part in any relationship they want, no matter how nontraditional. Welfare checks by police in both Illinois and Georgia in the past year didn’t lead to any charges; in January, the aspiring singer from Georgia told Cook County police she was “fine and did not want to be bothered.”\n\nAnd all of the women in Kelly’s inner circle are of legal age — the age of consent is 17 in Illinois and 16 in Georgia — despite Kelly’s history of allegations against him regarding his sexual conduct with women. He was last tried in 2008 in Illinois, where he was acquitted on 14 charges of making child pornography. The case, which took a record six and a half years to go to trial in Chicago, focused only on a single videotape that prosecutors alleged showed him having sex with a 14-year-old girl. (While he was a reporter at the Chicago Sun-Times, this reporter received the tape anonymously and turned it over to the police; called by Kelly's attorneys to testify, he took the Fifth Amendment rather than revealing sources.) The trial, however, excluded claims made by girls or their parents that alleged Kelly regularly abused his position of fame and influence to pursue illegal sexual relationships with underage girls — which has also been the subject of a dozen or more civil lawsuits against Kelly that were settled out of court with cash payments from Kelly. The girls signed nondisclosure agreements when they accepted the payments. Also excluded was evidence of Kelly’s marriage in 1994 to his then-15-year-old protégé, Aaliyah, for whom he wrote the album Age Ain’t Nothing But a Number. Chicago attorney Susan E. Loggans declined to say how many settlements she has negotiated with Kelly before lawsuits were ever filed, but she said they were “numerous,” and recently included one for a 17-year-old aspiring singer from Chicago’s West Side who is said to have been part of Kelly’s inner circle. Loggans gave no other details, citing attorney-client privilege and the terms of the settlement. Kelly also has been sued by other attorneys representing women over the age of consent in their respective states. In 2002, an Illinois lawsuit was filed by Montina Woods, a dancer who toured with Kelly’s friend Ronald Isley, in which Woods claimed she was unknowingly recorded by Kelly during sex. (Kelly eventually settled the suit, paying Woods an undisclosed sum.) And on April 21, a Mississippi lawsuit was filed by Hinds County sheriff’s deputy Kenny Bryant over an alleged affair between Kelly and Bryant’s wife. The music industry has a history of stars using their fame to gain the trust of young women — and their parents — who expect professional relationships but end up in sexual ones. But numerous sources, including women who left his inner circle, made on-the-record allegations suggesting ongoing mental and physical abuse of several women in Kelly’s entourage far beyond that of the groupie culture. For two decades, Kelly has been accused of a similar pattern of mistreating women — some have called it “predation” — but because of his acquittal on the child-porn charges and the nondisclosure agreements in his numerous civil cases, the charges have remained in the realm of gossip instead of derailing his career. Major record companies, television shows, and other stars continue to work with Kelly. Lady Gaga recorded the duet “Do What U Want” with Kelly in 2013, Lil Wayne, Ty Dolla Sign, and Juicy J made cameos on Kelly’s 2015 album The Buffet, and he performed on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon last December. He recently starred in a digital campaign for Alexander Wang. “I got trapped,” said former insider Jones. “I had people telling me I was an idiot. But it took me a long time to realize they were right, and I’m talking now because I hope I can help some of these other girls.”\n\nAndrew Gill/WBEZ Security cameras seen on R. Kelly's Chicago recording studio.\n\nAfter her backstage visit with Kelly in Indio, California, the aspiring singer from Georgia began secretly talking with Kelly on her cell phone, her mother said. “As far as I know, we weren’t talking to [Kelly] anymore,” J. said. “Or at least I wasn’t talking to him anymore.” In June 2015, J. and Tim said, their daughter lied to them about taking a weekend trip to visit a Georgia university. Instead, Mack arranged for her to fly to Oklahoma City, where Kelly was performing. After the show, she had sex with Kelly for the first time, she later told her parents and at least two friends, including a record producer who goes by the stage name TONE. As the Georgia singer and Kelly became closer, TONE recalled her saying she was frustrated with Kelly. She thought every time she tried to bring up her music career Kelly changed the topic to sex — and she wanted proof. So TONE and the woman decided to secretly record a phone conversation between her and Kelly. BuzzFeed News was later given a copy of the recording. On the tape, it’s not just what Kelly said that shows his pattern of behavior with the women close to him. It's how he said it, which is immediately clear from listening to the audio. “I miss my baby,” Kelly told the woman, before asking her what she was wearing. After she replied, he told her: “I want you to get in the habit of telling me what color panties you got on every day,” he instructed repeatedly, revealing in his own words the early stages of their power dynamic and the demands her parents say have become criminal.

Her roommate at the school, who is being identified by the initials T.S. to avoid retaliation, told BuzzFeed News that, at first, she did not believe her new friend really knew R. Kelly. But, T.S. said, the Georgia woman would often call the superstar and put him on speakerphone during their explicit sexual conversations.\n\nThe Georgia woman also began visiting Kelly at his homes in nearby Duluth and sometimes traveled with him to Chicago, according to T.S. She recalled the woman telling her that Kelly took away her cell phone and replaced it with a new one, with instructions that she should only use it to communicate with him and needed to obtain his permission to use it to communicate with others.\n\n“I’m more interested in developing you. Songs are not an issue. We can always do a hit song.”\n\nT.S. also recalled the woman telling her that one time, Kelly sent a cab to pick up the women at his guest house and bring them to a club where he would meet them. The Georgia woman told her roommate that she laughed when the cab driver told a joke, and one of the other women in the cab texted Kelly to report this violation of his “rules.” When the Georgia woman arrived at the club, T.S. said, Kelly “bent her over and he whupped her behind because she laughed at the cab driver, who happened to be a man.” By the middle of the 2016 fall semester, the Georgia woman’s appearance started to change: She began losing weight, and she cropped her long hair short, permed what was left, and dyed it blonde, said her parents and the former roommate. T.S. recalled her friend telling her that’s how Kelly liked her hair to look. The Georgia woman eventually began skipping all of her classes, and she did not show up to take her finals in mid-December. Her parents confirmed the school considers her a student who is “no longer in good standing.” She had already broken off all contact with her mother and father before she started skipping school. “My calls were all forwarded to voicemail,” J. said. In the middle of the fall semester, during their quest to bring their daughter home, J. said she called the new cell phone Kelly had given her daughter, who broke one of Kelly’s “rules” by texting her parents from the phone to say she was fine. J. said Kelly himself got on the phone after the daughter picked up and denied anything was wrong.\n\nNicole Craine Two of R. Kelly's rental properties near Atlanta.\n\nThe parents filed a missing persons report with the Gwinnett College campus police. A spokeswoman for the school confirmed the report and the case number, but said that when an investigator called the parents and learned that they knew their daughter was with Kelly in his suburban Atlanta homes no action could be taken. Their daughter was not technically missing, and at 21, she is of legal age to do what she wants, campus police said. The last time her parents saw her was in December 2016. “What we really wanted to do was an intervention,” J. said, but her daughter would not listen. On Dec. 27, 2016, J. and Tim requested that the Johns Creek Police Department, which is responsible for the section of Duluth where Kelly rents the two houses, perform a well-being check on their daughter at the guest house. The police report obtained by BuzzFeed News said J. believes her daughter is part of the R. Kelly “cult” and that he is “abusive and is controlling her daughter.” When police arrived, the report noted, the “door [was] open, house clear, no one there.” No further action was taken.\n\n“What we really wanted to do was an intervention.”\n\nA month later, the Cook County Sheriff’s police performed a well-being check in Chicago. The Georgia singer told officers she was “fine and did not want to be bothered with her parents because her father was threatening people,” according to the police report. (Tim denied this.) She told officers she instead keeps in touch with her grandmother, who she calls Nana. When reached by BuzzFeed News, Nana said that she had spoken to her granddaughter by phone only two or three times since December, most recently on July 11. She said her granddaughter emphasized that she’s an adult in a consensual relationship with Kelly, and was mad at her parents for intervening. In text messages reviewed by BuzzFeed News, the granddaughter said she thought her parents were trying to ruin Kelly’s career. Despite her granddaughter’s insistence, “I’m gravely concerned about her,” Nana said, echoing J.’s belief that she is being held against her will. If she could talk to Kelly today, Nana said, “I would tell R. Kelly to send my granddaughter home. He knows it’s not right and he would not want anybody doing this to his daughter.” Multiple attempts by BuzzFeed News to reach the Georgia woman on her Kelly-issued cell phone were unsuccessful. J. and Tim said they even reached out to the FBI about their daughter and spent hours being interviewed by an agent. Special Agent Stephen Emmett, an FBI spokesperson in Georgia, said the bureau’s policy is to neither confirm nor deny investigations into specific people or matters. But the parents are hopeful that perhaps federal law enforcement can help where local police have not. “It’s not about my daughter, per se. It’s about all the girls,” Tim said. “It’s about my daughter, and I understand that. But the abuse that my daughter is actually enduring, nobody should go through.”\n\nNam Y. Huh / Associated Press Kelly leaving the Cook County Criminal Court Building on June 13, 2008, after a jury found him not guilty on all counts in his child pornography trial.\n\nTwo other parents are fighting to get their daughter back. The parents of an aspiring professional singer from Florida said their daughter met Kelly when she was 17 years old, and she moved into one of his rental properties once she was over the age of legal consent. (BuzzFeed News verified their identities and full names, but is withholding the alleged victim's full name and her parents' last name to protect her privacy. Her mother asked to be called by her middle name, Theresa, for the same reason.) Theresa said she initially let her daughter spend time with Kelly because it was “supposed to be a music relationship.” She now regrets that decision. “My thing was I trusted. I have never been in the music industry before, ever,” Theresa said. “He is a lyrical genius — he is R. Kelly! And the fact is he went to court, he was never found guilty — he was acquitted — and we were led to believe there was no truth in it. Now I got all of these people asking about why my daughter is there, telling me, ‘All of that, the charges against Kelly, was true.’ Well, how come you didn’t tell me that before?” The Florida singer first met Kelly when her parents took her to see him perform at Funk Fest in Orlando on April 18, 2015.\n\n“The fact is he went to court, he was never found guilty — he was acquitted — and we were led to believe there was no truth in it.\"\n\n“During the show, they were pulling people out of the audience,” Theresa said. “A guy said, ‘Oh yeah, her.’ He pulled her up onstage.” After the show, a member of Kelly’s entourage gave the star’s phone number to the then-17-year-old high school senior, Theresa said. “We called, but he wasn’t answering, so we left it alone,” she said. “Then I guess he must have got back later on or texted her later on.” As with the Georgia woman, the relationship between Kelly and the Florida woman developed over phone calls and text messages that were kept secret from her family, the parents said. “And then one day we were looking for her because she should’ve been coming home from school,” Theresa said. “Then finally we get a text message saying that she’s OK, that she had met up with R. Kelly in his hotel. And I’m like, ‘You met up with R. Kelly at his hotel?’” Theresa and her husband, Angelo, said they rushed to the hotel and called the police, who advised them to deal with hotel security. Their daughter finally came down to see them, they said, but Kelly refused to talk with them. After the incident at the hotel, the Florida teen “was only [supposed to be] talking to him when one of us was around,” Theresa said. “We needed to make sure it was about music, because he was going to mentor her,” she said. “And then from there he wanted her to travel with him so she could see how the music game really was. ... We thought it could be an opportunity, and that she was going to be with a guardian — a female guardian that would keep an eye on her.” But that may have been wishful thinking. Soon enough, the Florida singer was living with Kelly. Angelo said he initially received short text messages from his daughter every few weeks saying she was fine and the parents should not worry or try to contact her. Those have stopped. McGee, one of the women who left Kelly, said the Florida woman is “head over heels” for Kelly. And McGee said Kelly is “obsessed” with the Florida woman, noting that he “would go into the kitchen and cook for her.” But McGee’s feelings about the Florida woman were nuanced. “I have a 17-year-old daughter myself,” she said. “When I saw [the Florida singer] with him, it took me back. This could be my daughter. I just knew that it was not right and I just couldn’t understand what a man almost 50 is doing having sex with someone the same age as his daughter. That’s when I realized it was more of a mind-control thing.” McGee also said she witnessed Kelly punish the aspiring Florida singer for breaking his “rules.”\n\n“I just couldn’t understand what a man almost 50 is doing having sex with someone the same age as his daughter.”\n\n“He left [the Florida woman] on the [tour] bus for, like, three days and she was not allowed to come out,” McGee said. “He said she didn’t do her homework — that’s why she was punished — which was very confusing, because she had just graduated [high school] over the summer.” Multiple attempts by BuzzFeed News to reach the Florida woman on her Kelly-issued cell phone were unsuccessful. Theresa said she is frustrated that lawyers and police have said they cannot help, and she fears that even if the relationship ends, she may not get her daughter back. On Dec. 24, 1996, Kelly was sued for $10 million by Tiffany “Tia” Hawkins, an aspiring singer and then–high school student in Chicago, who claimed she met the star when he lectured her choir class. According to the lawsuit, Hawkins began having sex with Kelly in 1991, when she was 15 and he was 24. The relationship ended in December 1994, when she was 18, the court documents state; distraught, she slit her wrists in an attempt to kill herself. “I desperately want my daughter back but I’m not [sure] what will [be] the repercussions if she doesn’t come willingly,” Theresa said. “These girls think this man loves them. Matters of the heart are a touchy subject.” The parents said they’ve tried numerous other tactics to bring their daughter home. In August 2015, the daughter texted Angelo that she was in Chicago with Kelly, the parents said. On Aug. 26, 2015, they sent their older daughter to Kelly’s recording studio to check on her sister, according to her parents. Kelly and men in his entourage allegedly got involved in an altercation with the older sister when she tried to take her younger sister away, said the parents, who claimed the star and the other men pushed, shoved, and hit the older sister. A police report obtained by BuzzFeed News indicated that one person allegedly struck the Florida singer’s sister in her face, but she did not seek medical attention. The case is classified as a simple battery and nobody has been arrested, according to the report, which said the investigation was initially suspended until a detective could contact the victim. A supplementary report was filed more than a year later, on Jan. 18, 2017. “I have not talked to my daughter in more than a year,” Theresa said, adding she has left countless texts and voicemail messages that have not yet received a response. “We’ve had deaths in the family, birthdays, and I haven’t heard from her and she hasn’t been here for any of it. I didn’t even hear from her on Mother’s Day. All I want to do is bring her home.” On Friday, July 14, after Kelly and the Florida woman had been asked for comment on this story, Angelo said he got a surprise phone call from his daughter, who invited him to come to see Kelly perform in Indiana on Saturday. Wary of Kelly’s motivations, Angelo said he declined the invitation. He also is angry over the other surprise news from his daughter: She said Kelly had recently paid for her to have breast enhancement surgery. “I am beyond furious,” Angelo said. “I said to her, ‘How could you do this? What the hell were you thinking? What if you died on the operating table?’ I don’t even know what we can do anymore. I just know we got to get her home.\"\n\nRick Kern / WireImage R. Kelly performing at Bass Concert Hall on March 3 in Austin.\n\nKelly has long maintained his innocence on allegations of underage sex, and in recent interviews he has either persistently dodged questions about his past behavior or stormed off when he was unable to do that. Multiple attempts to reach Kelly were unsuccessful. Kelly’s RCA Records publicist Theola Borden, who was promoted to senior vice president of publicity for the label in 2014, did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls requesting comment.\n\n“I suppose that is the price of fame. Like all of us, Mr. Kelly deserves a personal life.”",

        "text": "It has been nearly 15 years since music journalist Jim DeRogatis caught the story that has since defined his career, one that he wishes didn’t exist: R. Kelly’s sexual predation on teenage girls. DeRogatis, at that time the pop-music critic at the Chicago Sun-Times, was anonymously delivered the first of two videos he would receive depicting the pop star engaging in sexual acts with underage girls. Now the host of the syndicated public radio show Sound Opinions and a professor at Columbia College, DeRogatis, along with his former Sun-Times colleague Abdon Pallasch, didn’t just break the story, they did the only significant reporting on the accusations against Kelly, interviewing hundreds of people over the years, including dozens of young women whose lives DeRogatis says were ruined by the singer.\n\nThis past summer, leading up to Kelly’s headlining performance at the Pitchfork Music Festival, DeRogatis posted a series of discussions about Kelly’s career, the charges made against him, and sexual assault. He published a live review of the singer’s festival set that was an indictment of Pitchfork and its audience for essentially endorsing a man he calls “a monster.” In the two weeks since Kelly released his latest studio album, Black Panties, the conversation about him and why he has gotten a pass from music publications (not to mention feminist sites such as Jezebel) has been rekindled, in part because of the explicit nature of the album and also because of online arguments around the Pitchfork performance.\n\nI was one of those people who challenged DeRogatis and was even flip about his judgment — something I quickly came to regret. DeRogatis and I have tangled — even feuded on air — over the years; yet, amid the Twitter barbs, he approached me offline and told me about how one of Kelly’s victims called him in the middle of the night after his Pitchfork review came out, to thank him for caring when no one else did. He told me of mothers crying on his shoulder, seeing the scars of a suicide attempt on a girl’s wrists, the fear in their eyes. He detailed an aftermath that the public has never had to bear witness to.\n\nDeRogatis offered to give me access to every file and transcript he has collected in reporting this story — as he has to other reporters and journalists, none of whom has ever looked into the matter, thus relegating it to one man’s personal crusade.\n\nI thought that last fact merited a public conversation about why.\n\nIn this interview (which has been condensed significantly), DeRogatis speaks frankly and explicitly about the many disturbing charges against Kelly and says, ultimately, “The saddest fact I’ve learned is nobody matters less to our society than young black women. Nobody.”\n\nRefresh our memories. How did this start for you?\n\nBeing a beat reporter, music critic at a Chicago daily, the Sun-Times, R. Kelly was a huge story for me, this guy who rose from not graduating from Kenwood Academy, singing at backyard barbecues and on the El, to suddenly selling millions of records. I interviewed him a number of times. Then TP2.com came out. I’d written a review that said the jarring thing about Kelly is that one moment he wants to be riding you and then next minute he’s on his knees, crying and praying to his dead mother in Heaven for forgiveness for his unnamed sins. It’s a little weird at times. It’s just an observation.\n\nThe next day at the Sun-Times, we got this anonymous fax — we didn’t know where it came from. It said: R. Kelly’s been under investigation for two years by the sex-crimes unit of the Chicago police. And I threw it on the corner of my desk. I thought, “player-hater.” Now, from the beginning, there were rumors that Kelly likes them young. And there’d been this Aaliyah thing — Vibe printed, without much commentary and no reporting, the marriage certificate. Kelly or someone had falsified her age as 18. There was that. So all this is floating in the air. This fax arrives and I think, “Oh, this is somebody playing with this.” But there was something that nagged at me as a reporter. There were specific names, specific dates, and those great, long Polish cop names. And you’re not going to make that crap up. So I went to the city desk and I asked, “What do we do with this?” They said, Abdon Pallasch is the courts reporter, why don’t you two look into it and see if there’s anything there? And it turns out there had been lawsuits that had been filed that had never been reported.\n\nWhen you cover the courts in Chicago or any city, you go twice a day and you go through the bin of cases that have been filed and every once in a while Michael Jordan’s been sued or someone went bankrupt and it’s this sexy story and you pull it out. These suits had been filed at 4 p.m. on Christmas Eve. Ain’t no reporter working at 4 p.m. on Christmas Eve, and they flew under the radar. So we had these lawsuits that were explosive and we didn’t understand why nobody had reported them.\n\nExplosive in what regard?\n\nThey were stomach-churning. The one young woman, who had been 14 or 15 when R. Kelly began a relationship with her, detailed in great length, in her affidavits, a sexual relationship that began at Kenwood Academy: He would go back in the early years of his success and go to Lina McLin’s gospel choir class. She’s a legend in Chicago, gospel royalty. He would go to her sophomore class and hook up with girls afterward and have sex with them. Sometimes buy them a pair of sneakers. Sometimes just letting them hang out in his presence in the recording studio. She detailed the sexual relationship that she was scarred by. It lasted about one and a half to two years, and then he dumped her and she slit her wrists, tried to kill herself. Other girls were involved. She recruited other girls. He picked up other girls and made them all have sex together. A level of specificity that was pretty disgusting.\n\nHer lawsuit was hundreds of pages long, and Kelly countersued. The countersuit was, like, 10 pages long: “None of this is true!” We began our reporting. We knocked on a lot of doors. The lawsuits, the two that we had found initially, had been settled. Kelly had paid the women and their families money and the settlements were sealed by the court. But of course, the initial lawsuits remain part of the public record.\n\nSo her affidavit, this testimony — it’s all public record?\n\nTo this day, any reporter who so cares can go to Cook County and pull these records, so it drives me crazy, even with some of the eloquent reconsiderations we’ve seen of Kelly in recent days, that they keep saying “rumors” and “allegations”. Well, “allegations” is fair, OK. You’re protected as a reporter, any lawsuit that has been filed as fact. The contents of the lawsuit are protected. So these were not rumors. These were allegations made in court.\n\nDo you think part of how it’s been handled and why it’s been under-reported is that music writers may not know how to deal with it in a journalistic sense?\n\nLet’s start with the most mundane part. A lot of people who are critics are fans and don’t come with any academic background, with any journalistic background, research background. Now, nobody knows everything, and far be it from me to say you’ve got to be a journalist or you have to have studied critical theory in the academy. Part of what we do is journalistic. Get the names right, get the dates right, get the facts right. Sometimes, on a very rare number of stories, there’s a deeper level of reporting required.\n\nThere’s another reason: People are squeamish. I think a lot of people don’t know how to do it, don’t care to do it, and it’s way too much work. It’s just kind of disgusting to have to write about this and bum everyone out when you just want to review a record.\n\nYou and I got into it over Twitter around Pitchfork, in part over the fact that you were saying, “If you are enjoying R. Kelly, you are effectively cosigning what this man has done.” At the time, I was being defensive, saying people can like what they like.\n\nTo be clear, I think Pitchfork was cosigning it. I think each and every one of us, as individual listeners and consumers of culture, has to come up with our own answer. I don’t think there’s a right or wrong answer. The thing that’s interesting to me is that Pitchfork is a journalistic and critical organ. They do journalism and they do criticism. And then when they are making money to present an act — that’s a cosign, that’s an endorsement. That’s not just writing about and covering it. They very much wanted R. Kelly as their cornerstone artist for the festival. I think it’s fair game to say: “Why, Pitchfork?”\n\nI had purposely not listened to his music since the initial charges came out, and I saw these ninth- and 10th-grade girls interviewed on TV, talking about how he was in the parking lot of their school every day and everyone knew how come. That is what it took for me.\n\nPart of our reporting was sitting with those girls, sitting with their families, seeing their scars on their wrists, hearing the emotion.\n\nSome of our young critical peers, they’re 24 and all they know of Kelly’s past is some vague sense of scandal, because they were introduced to him as kids via Space Jam. A lot of your reporting on this is not online, it is not Google-able. Collective memory is that he “just” peed in a girl’s mouth.\n\nTo be fair, I teach 20-year-olds at Columbia. Ignorance is nothing to be ashamed of. Nobody knows everything. A lot of art, great art, is made by despicable people. James Brown beat his wife. People are always, “Why aren’t you upset about Led Zeppelin?” I got the Bonham three rings [tattooed] on my foot. Led Zeppelin did disgusting things. I read Hammer of the Gods, I’m disgusted by the group sex with the shark. [Note: it was actually a red snapper! Still gross.] I have a couple of responses to that: I didn’t cover Led Zeppelin. If I was on the plane, like Cameron Crowe was, I would have written about those things if I saw them.\n\nThe art very rarely talks about these things. There are not pro-rape Led Zeppelin songs. There are not pro-wife-beating James Brown songs. I think in the history of rock ‘n’ roll, rock music, or pop culture people misbehaving and behaving badly sexually with young women, rare is the amount of evidence compiled against anyone apart from R. Kelly. Dozens of girls — not one, not two, dozens — with harrowing lawsuits. The videotapes — and not just one videotape, numerous videotapes. And not Tommy Lee/Pam Anderson, Kardashian fun video. You watch the video for which he was indicted and there is the disembodied look of the rape victim. He orders her to call him Daddy. He urinates in her mouth and instructs her at great length on how to position herself to receive his “gift.” It’s a rape that you’re watching. So we’re not talking about rock star misbehavior, which men or women can do. We’re talking about predatory behavior. Their lives were ruined. Read the lawsuits!\n\nAnd there was a young woman who was pressured into an abortion?\n\nThat he paid for. There was a young woman that he picked up on the evening of her prom. The relationship lasted a year and a half or two years. Impregnated her, paid for her abortion, had his goons drive her. None of which she wanted. She sued him. The saddest fact I’ve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women. Nobody. They have any complaint about the way they are treated: They are “bitches, hos, and gold-diggers,” plain and simple. Kelly never misbehaved with a single white girl who sued him or that we know of. Mark Anthony Neal, the African-American scholar, makes this point : one white girl in Winnetka and the story would have been different.\n\nNo, it was young black girls and all of them settled. They settled because they felt they could get no justice whatsoever. They didn’t have a chance.\n\nAnd they learned that after putting these suits forth and having them get nowhere? Do you think they didn’t get traction because of the representation they had, or Kelly’s power? Were certain elements in concert with that?\n\nI think it was a lot of things, including the fact that Kelly was fully capable of intimidating people. These girls feared for their lives. They feared for the safety of their families. And these people talked to me not because I’m super reporter — we rang a lot of doorbells on the South and West sides, and people were eager to talk about this guy, because they wanted him to stop!\n\nGoing back a little bit to our original question: You get this tape dropped in the mail …\n\nWell, the tape came a year after we ran the first story. We ran this story and the world shrugged. Associated Press picks it up: “Chicago Sun-Times has reported a pattern of sexual predation of young women by Robert Kelly,” and everybody says, “Ah, well, OK.” Then one day I get this call that says: “Go to your mailbox. There’s this manila envelope with a videotape in it.”\n\nWe had gotten one videotape already after the first story, and we gave it to the police. When I say “we,” I mean a roomful of editors sitting around asking, “What is the right thing to do here? This would seem to be evidence of a felony, we should give it to police.” There was one tape, but the police could not determine the girl’s age. The forensic experts they had looking at it said judging by the soles of her feet, they could tell she was 13 or 14 at the time this tape was made, but we can’t identify who the woman is. Videotape No. 1.\n\nThere were tapes on the street. And I had heard of another video tape with a girl who was part of an ongoing relationship. This is the girl who was in the tape that was in the lawsuit.\n\nAnd some 40 people testified that it was her?\n\nYeah. Coaches, best friend’s parents, pastor, half the family, grandmother, aunt — but the mother and father never testified, the girl never testified. When we wrote our story about the tape, the girl and mother and father took a six-month vacation to the south of France. We’d been to the house several times. We’d rung the doorbell. This was an aluminum-siding, lower-middle-class house on the South Side, with a station wagon which is 13 years old — you know what I mean? And now they’re in the south of France. And one time the dad got a credit as a bass player on an R. Kelly album. He didn’t play bass.\n\nThe situations are incredibly complicated, and sometimes there is an element of, “We’re gonna exploit this situation for our favor.” That doesn’t mean that it’s legal or it’s right or that girl wasn’t harmed. It tore that family apart.\n\nHow many people do you think you’ve interviewed? How many people came forward?\n\nI think in the end there were two dozen women with various level of details. Obviously the women who were part of the hundreds of pages of lawsuits — hell of a lot of details. There were girls who just told one simple story, and there were a lot of girls who told stories that lasted hours which still make me sick to my stomach. It never was one girl on one tape. Or one girl and Aaliyah.\n\nThe other thing, the thing that people seem to not know: She was fresh out of eighth grade in this tape.\n\nFourteen or 15. That puts a perspective on it. She’s not sophisticated enough to know what her kinks are.\n\nLet’s talk about what it is, aside from not just having reportorial chops, that might hold somebody back. I feel that a lot of younger journalists came up through blogs, not journalism school. They are fearful to write about it because they don’t know what they can say, what language they can use, if they can be sued for even acknowledging charges.\n\nYou may not know how to report, but you should know how to read. The Sun-Times was never sued for the hundreds of thousands of words that it wrote about R. Kelly. You cannot be sued for repeating anything that is in a lawsuit. You cannot be sued for repeating anything that was said during the six- or seven-week trial. It’s in his record, and then there’s Kelly’s own words. Then read [Kelly’s biography] Soulacoaster. It was not a pleasant experience for me to read Soulacoaster! But read it, and read what he says in his own book! Do your goddamn homework!\n\nWhat are the other factors?\n\nHere’s the most sinister. This deeply troubles me: There’s a very — I don’t know what the percentage is — some percentage of fans are liking Kelly’s music because they know. And that’s really troublesome to me. There is some sort of — and this is tied up to complicated questions of racism and sexism — there is some sort of vicarious thrill to seeing this guy play this character in these songs and knowing that it’s not just a character.\n\nSongs like “Sexasaurus” kind of makes it novel. The ironic, jokey Trapped in the Closet series airs on the Independent Film Channel and features Will Oldham — that has these other hallmarks of “art” that read to a white, hipster, indie-rock audience, then, because we are not taking certain things seriously, we can choose not to take the lives of these young black women seriously.\n\nIt puts it in the realm of camp or kitsch. If you have an emotional reaction to a work of art and you use all your skills as a critic to back it up with evidence and context. That’s all we can ask of anybody. We’re all viewing art differently. The joy is in the conversation. Pitchfork is the premier critical organ in the United States for smart discussion of music, books, and artists, but it doesn’t have this discussion. The site reviews his records but doesn’t have the conversation about, “What does it say for us to like his music?”\n\nI think, again, everybody has to individually answer. I can still listen to Led Zeppelin and take joy in Led Zeppelin or James Brown. I condemn the things they did. I’m not reminded constantly in the art, because the art is not about it. But if you’re listening to “I want to marry you, pussy,” and not realizing that he said that to Aaliyah, who was 14, and making an album he named Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number — I had Aaliyah’s mother cry on my shoulder and say her daughter’s life was ruined, Aaliyah’s life was never the same after that. That’s not an experience you’ve had. I’m not expecting you to feel the same way I do. But you can look at this body of evidence. “You” meaning everybody who cares.\n\nYou told me about the night after your critical review of R. Kelly’s performance at Pitchfork ran, one of these women called you at 2 a.m.\n\nThis happens a lot. If you are a good reporter, you are accessible to people and you cannot turn a story off. And that sucks! The number of times since I began this R. Kelly story that I was called in the middle of the night, was talking to someone on Christmas Eve or on New Year’s Day or Thanksgiving. … Yeah, I got a call from one of the women after the Pitchfork festival review. “I know we haven’t spoken in a long time,” and said thank you for still caring and thank you for writing this story, because nobody gives a shit.\n\nIt was a horrible day and a horrible couple of weeks when he was acquitted. The women I heard from who I’d interviewed, women I’d never interviewed who said, “I didn’t come forward, I never spoke to you before, I wish I had now that son of a bitch got off.” Jesus Christ. Rape-victim advocates — I don’t believe in God — they do God’s work. These young women who volunteer to be in the emergency room and sit with a woman throughout the horrible process, I don’t do that. I’m not saying I’m even in the same universe. But somebody calls you up and says I want to talk about this, or thank you about writing this, or, “I can’t sleep because I’m haunted, can you hear what I want to tell you?” We do that as a human being. I would like to forget about this story. I’m not saying I’m super reporter. I’m saying this was a huge story. Where was everybody else?\n\nThere is a disregard for your ongoing concern about this. “Let this go, Jim. Get over it, Jim. He was acquitted.” You have never dropped this, and your peers are pissed because it puts the rest of us over a barrel. I can speak to this, too. It’s often uncool to be the person who gives a shit.\n\n“You’re jealous of R. Kelly, you’re trying to make your name off his career.”\n\nBecause you would love nothing more than to have to report and carry these stories of rape.\n\nRapes, plural. It is on record. Rapes in the dozen. So stop hedging your words, and when you tell me what a brilliant ode to pussy Black Panties is, then realize that the next sentence should say: “This, from a man who has committed numerous rapes.” The guy was a monster! Just say it! We do have a justice system and he was acquitted. OK, fine. And these other women took the civil lawsuit route. He was tried on very narrow grounds. He was tried on a 29-minute, 36-second videotape. He was tried on trading child pornography. He was not tried for rape. He was acquitted of making child pornography. He’s never been tried in court for rape, but look at the statistics. The numbers of rapes that happened, the numbers of rapes that were reported, the numbers of rapes that make it to court and then the conviction rate. I mean, it comes down to something minuscule. He’s never had his day in court as a rapist. It’s 15 years in the past now, but this record exists. You have to make a choice, as a listener, if music matters to you as more than mere entertainment. And you and I have spent our entire lives with that conviction. This is not just entertainment, this is our lifeblood. This matters.\n\nJessica Hopper is a freelance music and culture critic and the author of The Girls Guide to Rocking.\n\nRead the court files and all of Jim DeRogatis’ Sun-Times reporting on the case against R.

        "text": "A Cook County jury on Friday acquitted R&B superstar R. Kelly of child pornography charges, marking the end of a high-profile trial rich in courtroom drama and celebrity intrigue.\n\nThe 41-year-old singer, whose real name is Robert Kelly, long denied charges that he videotaped himself engaging in a variety of sex acts with his then-underage goddaughter.\n\nAuthorities said the female in the video could have been as young as 13 at the time. The jury of nine men and three women deliberated for 7 1/2 hours before finding Kelly not guilty on all 14 counts.\n\nKelly prayed in the courtroom in the moments before the verdict was announced.\n\nAs the verdicts kept coming in, each count not guilty, Kelly's attorney Sam Adam Jr. said he heard Kelly saying \"Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.\"\n\nAdam said his client \"was found not guilty because they had the best jury that Cook County could produce. Two things happened today. R. Kelly got his name back and [his goddaughter] never had to lose hers.\"\n\nCook County State's Atty. Dick Devine called the case unusual because the alleged victim denied being the woman in the video. Sometimes, the community has to press forward with the cases anyway, Devine said.\n\n\"If we acquire the same evidence today or tomorrow, we will bring that case,\" he said.\n\nKelly left the courtroom surrounded by his entourage, who kept reporters away from the singer and escorted him to a waiting SUV as some 50 supporters shouted support to him.\n\nThough Kelly did not speak to reporters, he did salute and wave to fans.\n\nAllan Mayer, a Kelly spokesman, spoke on the singer's behalf, saying, \"Robert has said all along that he believes in our system, and he believes in God. And that when all the facts came out in court, he'd be cleared of these terrible charges.\n\n\"He did not expect that it would take 6 1/2 years. It's been a terrible ordeal for him and his family, and at this point all he wants to do is move forward and try to put it behind him. He wants to thank his lawyers who defended him so brilliantly. He wants to thank his fans who stuck by him and supported him with such love.\n\n\" ... He's going to have more to say about all of this very soon. But for right now, he'd be more inclined to be with his family, collect himself and get strong again. But we'll be hearing from him soon about all of this.\"\n\nThe spokesman declined to take questions.\n\nKelly's SUV drove to Douglas Park on Chicago's West Side, where a tour bus was waiting for him and his entourage. There, Kelly, his entourage and his defense team exchanged hugs and handshakes.\n\nThe defense team was ecstatic with the verdict, calling it a major victory for an innocent man.\n\nEd Genson, Kelly's lead attorney, said he has \"graduated from late middle age to senior citizen on this case. Now I am going to get a little sleep.\"\n\nANALYZE THIS ...\n\nRedEye asked private criminal defense attorney Tamara Holder, who is not connected to the case, for her take on the R. Kelly trial, which ended Friday with the jury acquitting the singer on all counts. Holder speculated that the outcome was a result of prosecutors' failure to overcome two major hurdles:\n\n* Questions about the origin and the quality of the tape central to the trial may have canceled out its power, according to Holder.\n\n\"I would have had the most amazing expert testify and to have done any kind of analysis possible,\" Holder said. \"That's what [prosecutors] should have done instead of playing the tape and talking about it.\"\n\n* Jurors could have been suspicious as to why the alleged victim didn't get summoned by the prosecution, Holder said.\n\n\"If the victim is alive, the prosecution has got to get the victim to testify ... they should have that in the six years it took to try this case,\" Holder said. [KYRA KYLES, REDEYE]\n\nTRIAL TIMELINE\n\nFRIDAY'S VERDICT ENDS A BIZARRE CASE THAT HAD LANGUISHED FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS. HERE'S A LOOK BACK:\n\nFeb. 2002\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times receives a videotape that allegedly shows R. Kelly having sex with a girl who may have been as young as 13.\n\nJune 2002\n\nR. Kelly is charged with 21 counts of child pornography for allegedly making a videotaping of himself engaging in sexual acts with a minor.\n\nFeb. 2004\n\nCook County prosecutors drop seven of 21 child pornography charges.\n\nFeb. 2007\n\nTrial is postponed after Kelly undergoes emergency surgery for a burst appendix.\n\nMay 2008\n\nJury selection begins, with the trial starting on May 20. In opening statements, prosecutors show the controversial videotape.\n\nThursday\n\nThe trial comes to a close with the prosecution again showing the videotape -- central to the case -- in closing arguments to jurors and a courtroom crowded with spectators, as well as international and local media.\n\nFriday\n\nAfter 7 1/2 hours of deliberating, the jury acquits R. Kelly. [REDEYE]",

        "text": "Sebastian Kim\n\nAnother baffling mystery explained (sort of).\n\nIn GQ’s recent interview with R. Kelly, he addressed many of the troubling mysteries that have surrounded him over the years—albeit often in ways that only seemed to suggest even stranger and deeper puzzles about who he really is. But even a 11,000-word article couldn’t contain everything that Kelly discussed over those three days in Chicago.\n\nOne particular conversation covered something that has left plenty of people baffled, vexed, and incensed over the years: the way that, at the height of his legal issues involving alleged sexual predation, Kelly began referring to himself as “the Pied Piper of R&B.” It was startling enough that he continued to release highly sexualized records, though this could at least be presented as the stubborn refusal of an innocent man to change his style. But calling himself “the Pied Piper of R&B,” of all things—to many people, it just seemed as if he was taunting everyone.\n\nIn truth, Kelly seems completely bemused when—sitting on the ninety-ninth floor of the Sears Tower toward the end of our first meeting—I bring this up, and he appears to have no idea why I have done so.\n\n“I started calling myself the Pied Piper,” he explains, “when I started using the flute sound in my music.” He starts listing songs in which he used it. (He mentions “Fiesta” and “Snake”; I mention “Step in the Name of Love,” the first of his own songs where he actually refers to himself by this name.) “I was the Pied Piper. You know, blew a flute. I started calling myself the Pied Piper because of the flute.”\n\nBut, I say, did you understand why people thought that was strange?\n\n“Absolutely not,” he replies. “I was just thinking about the flute, you know.”\n\nBut, I continue, you know the story of the Pied Piper?\n\nHe shakes his head. “I don’t really know the story of the Pied Piper. I don’t read stories, first of all. I just remember either a rabbit or a rat leading people out of the village with a flute.” And he laughs at the thought. “That’s all I can tell you.”\n\nSo now I have the surreal experience of explaining to someone who has been calling himself “the Pied Piper of R&B”—for over a decade, through a parade of underage-sex accusations—the fable of the Pied Piper, as it is most often told and as I know it: how the Piper was hired by the people of Hamelin to lure away all of the town’s rats with his music and then, when he did so and the adults of Hamelin refused to pay him, how the Pied Piper took revenge by luring away all of their children and killing them.",

        "text": "The R. Kelly Problem He’s a musical geniusand he’s been accused of some awful things. Is it okay to listen to him?\n\nR. Kelly whirls around, straining to look out his car’s rear window. You see that? asks the R&B star, sitting in the middle row of a black SUV cruising down Manhattan’s West Side. On this sparkling afternoon in early fall, he’s just noticed a young woman driving a red sedan one lane over. Damn, says Kelly, as the smoke from his cigar curls along his giant gold watch and up past his diamond earring. Uhm-hmm, says a bearded assistant in a baseball cap from the backseat. This man’s job, as best I can tell, is to light his boss’s cigar and carry around a small duffel bag. The SUV pulls even with the woman’s car, and Kelly, on his way to a Chelsea recording studio, goes quiet, staring at the woman as she looks straight ahead.\n\nOur driver changes lanes. Kelly grimaces, as if seeing an attractive woman in a passing car and not being able to do anything about it hurts. New York got a lotta pretty girls, he says. His assistant gives a sleepy nod.\n\nThe SUV pulls in front of the studio. We’re here to listen to tracks from next month’s The Buffet, the 13th album of Kelly’s massively successful, extremely controversial career, and the first one since allegations of his past sexual misconduct resurfaced online, causing many to argue that Kelly is both a predator overdue for punishment and a walking moral dilemma.\n\nWe step into an elevator. As it rises, Kelly, tall and wearing patterned jeans, sunglasses, and a baggy gray hoodie that mostly hides his slight middle-aged paunch, points his cigar at me. You gonna be asking me all these things, he says. So let me ask you something first: What do you call a black man who flies an airplane?\n\nI don’t know.\n\nYou call him a pilot, says Kelly. What’s wrong with you? He laughs. Gotta keep you off balance, he says. Gotta set the tone.\n\nSo let’s do that. Here are some key things to know about R. Kelly. His first name is Robert, he’s 48 years old, and he’s inarguably the biggest male R&B singer since Marvin Gaye. Probably the most talented and sexually explicit, too. He grew up poor and functionally ­illiterateowing to dyslexiaon Chicago’s South Side, raised mostly by his mother. In his memoir, Soulacoaster: The Diary of Me, he wrote about being sexually abused as a child by a woman from the neighborhood. Around the same time, boarders in his family’s house repeatedly made him take photos of them having sex. When he was 8, he watched helplessly as his first love, Lulu, drowned after bullies pushed her into a creek. At 11, he was shot by thieves trying to steal his bike. The bullet is still in his shoulder.\n\nKelly was musical from as far back as he can remember, and he began his career on the streets, singing for money in his clear, gorgeous tenor. In 1991, he joined a New Jack Swing group, Public Announcement, and went solo soon after. His debut, 12 Play (as opposed, the logic goes, to a less capable lover’s foreplay), was released in 1993. Since then, Kelly has sold somewhere in the neighborhood of 34 million albums. He’s been nominated for 25 Grammy Awards and won three. In 2010, Billboard named Kelly the No. 1 R&B and hip-hop artist of the last quarter-­century. In addition to his own batch of 33 sinuous, perfectly arranged top-20 R&B hit singles, and another 17 that achieved the same designation on the pop Hot 100, Kelly has collaborated on smashes with Céline Dion and Michael Jackson. Pitchfork deemed his irresistible Ignition (Remix) the 19th-best track of the aughts. He was largely responsible for introducing Aaliyah, Drake’s emotional lodestar, to the world. Even Jim DeRogatis, the former Chicago Sun-Times reporter and pop critic, who has done more than anyone else to spread the word on Kelly’s alleged unlawful sexual behavior, admits: The man is a musical genius.\n\nThat’s the music. There’s also this: a long list of allegations that Kelly has used his money and power to have sex with minors. In 1994, when Kelly was 27 and Aaliyah was 15, the two were married under a falsified document that stated she was 18. The marriage was quickly annulled and Kelly, who produced Aaliyah’s debut albumcalled Age Ain’t Nothing But a Numberhasn’t said much about it since, out of, he says, respect for the late singer’s family. (Aaliyah had signed an agreement requiring her to stay silent about the brief marriage.) In 1996, Kelly was sued for damages by a woman alleging the two began a sexual relationship when she was 15. Kelly settled out of court. In 2001, a similar lawsuit with a similar result. The next year, he was indicted on 21 counts of making child pornography after police came into possession of a video depicting a man resembling Kelly having sex with a young woman. Also in 2002, another lawsuit, this one from a woman claiming both that Kelly impregnated her while she was underage and that one of his associates took her to get an abortion. Kelly settled. That same year, a woman sued Kelly for filming, without her knowledge, the two having sex. Kelly settled. It goes on: at least a half-dozen more lawsuits, followed by settlements, followed by nondisclosure agreements. (There are also reportedly a handful of instances in which Kelly has agreed to payments before lawsuits were even filed. Presumably these, too, involve NDAs.)",

        "text": "Kelly was so affronted by the line of questioning that he up and left the studio -- but not before he commented on Modarressy-Tehrani's appearance, wondered whether she knew what the word \"deposition\" meant and questioned her level of intelligence. The only silver lining was that we got to see Modarressy-Tehrani keep her calm while being berated for asking the questions that any reporter should. (Watch a selection of clips from the interview below.)\n\nR. Kelly got a bit miffed Monday afternoon when HuffPost Live host Caroline Modarressy-Tehrani questioned the artist about how the sexual assault allegations against him impact the way fans consume his music.\n\nIn the midst of Kelly's deflection and abject horror that a reporter would deign to be anything but \"positive\" about him and his career, Modarressy-Tehrani responded like a boss. When Kelly called her a \"beautiful woman,\" she reminded him, \"You don't have to comment on my appearance, sir.\" When he continuously cut her off, she told him, \"Now let me do my job for a second because I haven't been able to ask you a question for a moment,\" before pressing him on the topics he'd been dodging.\n\nAsking the tough questions -- even when they don't have clear or comfortable answers -- is exactly what reporters are tasked with doing.\n\nA little background: Kelly has been accused of sexual assault by dozens of young women -- many of them in the context of lawsuits, many of them minors. The story was first reported in December 2000 by Chicago Sun-Times reporters Jim DeRogatis and Abdon M. Pallasch. In the years since, as the Village Voice reported in 2013, DeRogatis has \"interview[ed] hundreds of people...including dozens of young women whose lives DeRogatis says were ruined by the singer.\"\n\nIn that same Village Voice interview, published just after Kelly's \"Black Panties\" album dropped, DeRogatis calls the lawsuits against Kelly \"stomach-churning.\" As he told the Village Voice's Jessica Hopper:\n\nI think in the history of rock 'n' roll, rock music, or pop culture people misbehaving and behaving badly sexually with young women, rare is the amount of evidence compiled against anyone apart from R. Kelly. Dozens of girls -- not one, not two, dozens -- with harrowing lawsuits. The videotapes -- and not just one videotape, numerous videotapes... You watch the video for which he was indicted and there is the disembodied look of the rape victim. He orders her to call him Daddy. He urinates in her mouth and instructs her at great length on how to position herself to receive his \"gift.\" It's a rape that you're watching. So we're not talking about rock star misbehavior, which men or women can do. We're talking about predatory behavior. Their lives were ruined.\n\nA note to famous people seeking media promotion: If you've been accused of assaulting multiple minors, be prepared to be questioned about it.\n\nAs Modarressy-Tehrani told Kelly after he repeatedly dodged her questions but offered his \"love,\" \"You don't need to give me any of your love, sir...I just wanted to ask the question.\"\n\nHead over to HuffPost Live to watch the full interview.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:",

        "text": "That's not how I'm doing this. First, if he isn't prepared to engage in some kind of serious discussion on the more difficult parts of his life, then I can't see how there can be a significant article about R. Kelly in 2016 that is worth printing. Second, it would make me feel spineless and undignified. I've read, listened to, and watched every other R. Kelly interview I could find, and too often what happens is that if interviewers mention anything at all, what they do is make a perfunctory little raid on the subject, touching it just to say they did. Why play around? He knows, at least to some degree, what's coming. He's a grown man, 48 years old. He's stood on a thousand stages and sat through a criminal trial. I know it's not going to be a comfortable conversation, but surely the most respectful way to have it is to get on and have it.\n\nSo, walking in here, that is my plan.\n\nThe ninety-ninth floor appears to be completely bare. In the huge rectangular room where we meet, there are only two places to sit. One is on some sofas over in the far corner. Kelly chooses the other option. And so we sit facing each other, at a small round table set in the middle of the large empty space on the lakeward side of the tower, glass on three sides of us. It looks like a surreal over-the-top set for an interrogation scene in an action movie. Before we begin, Kelly tries to prop up his phone on the table between us, to record the conversation—I am as well—but it keeps sliding and falling over. First of all, before anything else, I want to talk with him about his childhood, and in particular some tough aspects of it that seem central to whom he has become. For one thing, his inability to read.\n\n“Other kids could read, other kids could write, other kids could spell, they could do math,” he says. “I felt like an alien, I felt like an outcast. I felt like, ‘What is going to happen to me?’ My mother couldn't answer it. My stepfather wasn't really interested in it one way or another. And my brothers and sisters were so young at the time they wouldn't do nothing but tease me about it. I was the ‘dummy’: ‘How you gon’ do this? You can't even read!' ”\n\nHe says it's not like he didn't try, and he describes what would happen when he did: “I would always hear scrambled music, like an orchestra going off that didn't know what they was doing. It was so confusing. It was, like, violin's playing ‘I Believe I Can Fly,’ the bass is playing ‘When a Woman's Fed Up,’ the guitar's playing ‘Bump N' Grind,’ the piano's playing a gospel song. And then I would end up getting really sleepy and tired.”\n\nReading remains a struggle. “Since my daughter showed me voice texts on my phone, I've gotten a lot better,” he says. “I'm not a A student, I'm not even a B student, but I've gotten a lot better with the reading because of texts. And I can voice-text and say whatever I want to people. And then they text me back and I take my time and I can read through it.”\n\nR. Kelly Sings the Story of His Life, the Abridged Version\n\nEarly on, Kelly faced other challenges. He grew up without a father, gone before Kelly was born, and his mother wouldn't talk about him. “That's the one thing,” he says to me. “If I could change anything, I would definitely have had a father around. My father. I would definitely say it affected me deeply as a young man, coming up. Who doesn't want a father? Those are the beginnings, and those are what can dictate the roads you choose in life, and choosing them well. And it affected me.”\n\nKelly had a deep, close relationship with his mother, but he says even she never knew everything that was going on in her young son's turbulent life. He says that until he mentioned it in his 2012 memoir, Soulacoaster, he had never told anyone at all about the sexual abuse that he experienced. (Not even his ex-wife Andrea? “Absolutely not.”) It was something he “put so far in the back of my mind that I even forgot about it.” This wasn't the history he wanted for the person he was becoming: “As I got older, the more I just didn't want it to be in my past. The more I became successful.” He was determined that the R. Kelly the world would know—the one who would sell more than 30 million albums, have 36 Billboard Hot 100 hits, invent his own strange musical language, write hits for countless others, and conceive one of the weirdest syntheses of video and music of all time, Trapped in the Closet—would be someone else. “I didn't want that to be something that was in my luggage once I got to my success home, so to speak.”\n\nIn the book, he describes a number of premature sexual experiences, including an approach by a trusted family friend, a man, who he says tried to persuade Kelly to masturbate him for money, which Kelly says he rebuffed. “It was a crazy weird experience,” he tells me. “But not a full-blown experience, because it didn't go down. Contact sexual—no. A visual—absolutely. A visual from him showing me his penis and all that stuff.” But he describes in his memoir how the full-on sexual abuse that lasted for several years (it was oral sex the first time, though he tells me it soon became intercourse) started one day when Kelly fell asleep in front of the TV and was awoken from “a crazy dream about Three's Company” to find a woman playing with him:",

Or perhaps convincing a ragtag group of cartoons led by Michael Jordan to believe they can fly, if not educating you in the finer arts of jubilantly celebrating the freakin’ weekend. But now the infamous musician has taken on a brand new role, giving all of these Instagram It-Girls a run for their money as the newest star of Alexander Wang‘s Spring/Summer 2017 digital campaign alongside model and brand-favorite Anna Ewers.\n\nThe campaign for the designer’s latest collection was shot by famed photographers Inez and Vinoodh in the penthouse of the Old Police Building in downtown Manhattan. According to a press release for the campaign aptly titled, “Beyond Reality,” the images are meant to “blur the lines between fantasy and reality, presenting a unique observation on the superficial with a though-provoking commentary on society’s current obsessions with speculation: did that happen, did it not? What was real and what was fabricated?”\n\nRELATED: Meet R. Kelly’s Secret Soulmate: Stanley Kubrick?\n\nThe photos themselves feature R. Kelly wearing an all-black suit with no tie, a striped scarf, and his signature shades all while smoking a cigar and lounging side-by-side with Ewers who wears a big, white fur coat and crystal-covered bucket bag while smoking a cigarette.\n\nThe photos were taken during a giant party Wang held in the building on December 7 in collaboration with Beats by Dr. Dre to celebrate the launch of his second headphone collaboration.\n\nIn the end, we can’t decide what we’re more excited about, R. Kelly’s promising new career as a burgeoning supermodel, or the additional 4o chapters of his seminal hip-hopera “Trapped in the Closet” that he has assured the public are forthcoming. Only time will tell.\n\nWhat do you think of R. Kelly joining the #WANGSQUAD? Who would you like to see become a member next? Sound off below!",

Kelly’s sexual predation on teenage girls. DeRogatis, at that time the pop-music critic at the Chicago Sun-Times, was anonymously delivered the first of two videos he would receive depicting the pop star engaging in sexual acts with underage girls. Now the host of the syndicated public radio show Sound Opinions and a professor at Columbia College, DeRogatis, along with his former Sun-Times colleague Abdon Pallasch, didn’t just break the story, they did the only significant reporting on the accusations against Kelly, interviewing hundreds of people over the years, including dozens of young women whose lives DeRogatis says were ruined by the singer.\n\nThis past summer, leading up to Kelly’s headlining performance at the Pitchfork Music Festival, DeRogatis posted a series of discussions about Kelly’s career, the charges made against him, and sexual assault. He published a live review of the singer’s festival set that was an indictment of Pitchfork and its audience for essentially endorsing a man he calls “a monster.” In the two weeks since Kelly released his latest studio album, Black Panties, the conversation about him and why he has gotten a pass from music publications (not to mention feminist sites such as Jezebel) has been rekindled, in part because of the explicit nature of the album and also because of online arguments around the Pitchfork performance.\n\nI was one of those people who challenged DeRogatis and was even flip about his judgment — something I quickly came to regret. DeRogatis and I have tangled — even feuded on air — over the years; yet, amid the Twitter barbs, he approached me offline and told me about how one of Kelly’s victims called him in the middle of the night after his Pitchfork review came out, to thank him for caring when no one else did. He told me of mothers crying on his shoulder, seeing the scars of a suicide attempt on a girl’s wrists, the fear in their eyes. He detailed an aftermath that the public has never had to bear witness to.\n\nDeRogatis offered to give me access to every file and transcript he has collected in reporting this story — as he has to other reporters and journalists, none of whom has ever looked into the matter, thus relegating it to one man’s personal crusade.\n\nI thought that last fact merited a public conversation about why.\n\nIn this interview (which has been condensed significantly), DeRogatis speaks frankly and explicitly about the many disturbing charges against Kelly and says, ultimately, “The saddest fact I’ve learned is nobody matters less to our society than young black women. Nobody.”\n\nRefresh our memories. How did this start for you?\n\nBeing a beat reporter, music critic at a Chicago daily, the Sun-Times, R. Kelly was a huge story for me, this guy who rose from not graduating from Kenwood Academy, singing at backyard barbecues and on the El, to suddenly selling millions of records. I interviewed him a number of times. Then TP2.com came out. I’d written a review that said the jarring thing about Kelly is that one moment he wants to be riding you and then next minute he’s on his knees, crying and praying to his dead mother in Heaven for forgiveness for his unnamed sins. It’s a little weird at times. It’s just an observation.\n\nThe next day at the Sun-Times, we got this anonymous fax — we didn’t know where it came from. It said: R. Kelly’s been under investigation for two years by the sex-crimes unit of the Chicago police. And I threw it on the corner of my desk. I thought, “player-hater.” Now, from the beginning, there were rumors that Kelly likes them young. And there’d been this Aaliyah thing — Vibe printed, without much commentary and no reporting, the marriage certificate. Kelly or someone had falsified her age as 18. There was that. So all this is floating in the air. This fax arrives and I think, “Oh, this is somebody playing with this.” But there was something that nagged at me as a reporter. There were specific names, specific dates, and those great, long Polish cop names. And you’re not going to make that crap up. So I went to the city desk and I asked, “What do we do with this?” They said, Abdon Pallasch is the courts reporter, why don’t you two look into it and see if there’s anything there? And it turns out there had been lawsuits that had been filed that had never been reported.\n\nWhen you cover the courts in Chicago or any city, you go twice a day and you go through the bin of cases that have been filed and every once in a while Michael Jordan’s been sued or someone went bankrupt and it’s this sexy story and you pull it out. These suits had been filed at 4 p.m. on Christmas Eve. Ain’t no reporter working at 4 p.m. on Christmas Eve, and they flew under the radar. So we had these lawsuits that were explosive and we didn’t understand why nobody had reported them.\n\nExplosive in what regard?\n\nThey were stomach-churning. The one young woman, who had been 14 or 15 when R. Kelly began a relationship with her, detailed in great length, in her affidavits, a sexual relationship that began at Kenwood Academy: He would go back in the early years of his success and go to Lina McLin’s gospel choir class. She’s a legend in Chicago, gospel royalty. He would go to her sophomore class and hook up with girls afterward and have sex with them. Sometimes buy them a pair of sneakers. Sometimes just letting them hang out in his presence in the recording studio. She detailed the sexual relationship that she was scarred by. It lasted about one and a half to two years, and then he dumped her and she slit her wrists, tried to kill herself. Other girls were involved. She recruited other girls. He picked up other girls and made them all have sex together. A level of specificity that was pretty disgusting.\n\nHer lawsuit was hundreds of pages long, and Kelly countersued. The countersuit was, like, 10 pages long: “None of this is true!” We began our reporting. We knocked on a lot of doors. The lawsuits, the two that we had found initially, had been settled. Kelly had paid the women and their families money and the settlements were sealed by the court. But of course, the initial lawsuits remain part of the public record.\n\nSo her affidavit, this testimony — it’s all public record?\n\nTo this day, any reporter who so cares can go to Cook County and pull these records, so it drives me crazy, even with some of the eloquent reconsiderations we’ve seen of Kelly in recent days, that they keep saying “rumors” and “allegations”. Well, “allegations” is fair, OK. You’re protected as a reporter, any lawsuit that has been filed as fact. The contents of the lawsuit are protected. So these were not rumors. These were allegations made in court.\n\nDo you think part of how it’s been handled and why it’s been under-reported is that music writers may not know how to deal with it in a journalistic sense?\n\nLet’s start with the most mundane part. A lot of people who are critics are fans and don’t come with any academic background, with any journalistic background, research background. Now, nobody knows everything, and far be it from me to say you’ve got to be a journalist or you have to have studied critical theory in the academy. Part of what we do is journalistic. Get the names right, get the dates right, get the facts right. Sometimes, on a very rare number of stories, there’s a deeper level of reporting required.\n\nThere’s another reason: People are squeamish. I think a lot of people don’t know how to do it, don’t care to do it, and it’s way too much work. It’s just kind of disgusting to have to write about this and bum everyone out when you just want to review a record.\n\nYou and I got into it over Twitter around Pitchfork, in part over the fact that you were saying, “If you are enjoying R. Kelly, you are effectively cosigning what this man has done.” At the time, I was being defensive, saying people can like what they like.\n\nTo be clear, I think Pitchfork was cosigning it. I think each and every one of us, as individual listeners and consumers of culture, has to come up with our own answer. I don’t think there’s a right or wrong answer. The thing that’s interesting to me is that Pitchfork is a journalistic and critical organ. They do journalism and they do criticism. And then when they are making money to present an act — that’s a cosign, that’s an endorsement. That’s not just writing about and covering it. They very much wanted R. Kelly as their cornerstone artist for the festival. I think it’s fair game to say: “Why, Pitchfork?”\n\nI had purposely not listened to his music since the initial charges came out, and I saw these ninth- and 10th-grade girls interviewed on TV, talking about how he was in the parking lot of their school every day and everyone knew how come. That is what it took for me.\n\nPart of our reporting was sitting with those girls, sitting with their families, seeing their scars on their wrists, hearing the emotion.\n\nSome of our young critical peers, they’re 24 and all they know of Kelly’s past is some vague sense of scandal, because they were introduced to him as kids via Space Jam. A lot of your reporting on this is not online, it is not Google-able. Collective memory is that he “just” peed in a girl’s mouth.\n\nTo be fair, I teach 20-year-olds at Columbia. Ignorance is nothing to be ashamed of. Nobody knows everything. A lot of art, great art, is made by despicable people. James Brown beat his wife. People are always, “Why aren’t you upset about Led Zeppelin?” I got the Bonham three rings [tattooed] on my foot. Led Zeppelin did disgusting things. I read Hammer of the Gods, I’m disgusted by the group sex with the shark. [Note: it was actually a red snapper! Still gross.] I have a couple of responses to that: I didn’t cover Led Zeppelin. If I was on the plane, like Cameron Crowe was, I would have written about those things if I saw them.\n\nThe art very rarely talks about these things. There are not pro-rape Led Zeppelin songs. There are not pro-wife-beating James Brown songs. I think in the history of rock ‘n’ roll, rock music, or pop culture people misbehaving and behaving badly sexually with young women, rare is the amount of evidence compiled against anyone apart from R. Kelly. Dozens of girls — not one, not two, dozens — with harrowing lawsuits. The videotapes — and not just one videotape, numerous videotapes. And not Tommy Lee/Pam Anderson, Kardashian fun video. You watch the video for which he was indicted and there is the disembodied look of the rape victim. He orders her to call him Daddy. He urinates in her mouth and instructs her at great length on how to position herself to receive his “gift.” It’s a rape that you’re watching. So we’re not talking about rock star misbehavior, which men or women can do. We’re talking about predatory behavior. Their lives were ruined. Read the lawsuits!\n\nAnd there was a young woman who was pressured into an abortion?\n\nThat he paid for. There was a young woman that he picked up on the evening of her prom. The relationship lasted a year and a half or two years. Impregnated her, paid for her abortion, had his goons drive her. None of which she wanted. She sued him. The saddest fact I’ve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women. Nobody. They have any complaint about the way they are treated: They are “bitches, hos, and gold-diggers,” plain and simple. Kelly never misbehaved with a single white girl who sued him or that we know of. Mark Anthony Neal, the African-American scholar, makes this point : one white girl in Winnetka and the story would have been different.\n\nNo, it was young black girls and all of them settled. They settled because they felt they could get no justice whatsoever. They didn’t have a chance.\n\nAnd they learned that after putting these suits forth and having them get nowhere? Do you think they didn’t get traction because of the representation they had, or Kelly’s power? Were certain elements in concert with that?\n\nI think it was a lot of things, including the fact that Kelly was fully capable of intimidating people. These girls feared for their lives. They feared for the safety of their families. And these people talked to me not because I’m super reporter — we rang a lot of doorbells on the South and West sides, and people were eager to talk about this guy, because they wanted him to stop!\n\nGoing back a little bit to our original question: You get this tape dropped in the mail …\n\nWell, the tape came a year after we ran the first story. We ran this story and the world shrugged. Associated Press picks it up: “Chicago Sun-Times has reported a pattern of sexual predation of young women by Robert Kelly,” and everybody says, “Ah, well, OK.” Then one day I get this call that says: “Go to your mailbox. There’s this manila envelope with a videotape in it.”\n\nWe had gotten one videotape already after the first story, and we gave it to the police. When I say “we,” I mean a roomful of editors sitting around asking, “What is the right thing to do here? This would seem to be evidence of a felony, we should give it to police.” There was one tape, but the police could not determine the girl’s age. The forensic experts they had looking at it said judging by the soles of her feet, they could tell she was 13 or 14 at the time this tape was made, but we can’t identify who the woman is. Videotape No. 1.\n\nThere were tapes on the street. And I had heard of another video tape with a girl who was part of an ongoing relationship. This is the girl who was in the tape that was in the lawsuit.\n\nAnd some 40 people testified that it was her?\n\nYeah. Coaches, best friend’s parents, pastor, half the family, grandmother, aunt — but the mother and father never testified, the girl never testified. When we wrote our story about the tape, the girl and mother and father took a six-month vacation to the south of France. We’d been to the house several times. We’d rung the doorbell. This was an aluminum-siding, lower-middle-class house on the South Side, with a station wagon which is 13 years old — you know what I mean? And now they’re in the south of France. And one time the dad got a credit as a bass player on an R. Kelly album. He didn’t play bass.\n\nThe situations are incredibly complicated, and sometimes there is an element of, “We’re gonna exploit this situation for our favor.” That doesn’t mean that it’s legal or it’s right or that girl wasn’t harmed. It tore that family apart.\n\nHow many people do you think you’ve interviewed? How many people came forward?\n\nI think in the end there were two dozen women with various level of details. Obviously the women who were part of the hundreds of pages of lawsuits — hell of a lot of details. There were girls who just told one simple story, and there were a lot of girls who told stories that lasted hours which still make me sick to my stomach. It never was one girl on one tape. Or one girl and Aaliyah.\n\nThe other thing, the thing that people seem to not know: She was fresh out of eighth grade in this tape.\n\nFourteen or 15. That puts a perspective on it. She’s not sophisticated enough to know what her kinks are.\n\nLet’s talk about what it is, aside from not just having reportorial chops, that might hold somebody back. I feel that a lot of younger journalists came up through blogs, not journalism school. They are fearful to write about it because they don’t know what they can say, what language they can use, if they can be sued for even acknowledging charges.\n\nYou may not know how to report, but you should know how to read. The Sun-Times was never sued for the hundreds of thousands of words that it wrote about R. Kelly. You cannot be sued for repeating anything that is in a lawsuit. You cannot be sued for repeating anything that was said during the six- or seven-week trial. It’s in his record, and then there’s Kelly’s own words. Then read [Kelly’s biography] Soulacoaster. It was not a pleasant experience for me to read Soulacoaster! But read it, and read what he says in his own book! Do your goddamn homework!\n\nWhat are the other factors?\n\nHere’s the most sinister. This deeply troubles me: There’s a very — I don’t know what the percentage is — some percentage of fans are liking Kelly’s music because they know. And that’s really troublesome to me. There is some sort of — and this is tied up to complicated questions of racism and sexism — there is some sort of vicarious thrill to seeing this guy play this character in these songs and knowing that it’s not just a character.\n\nSongs like “Sexasaurus” kind of makes it novel. The ironic, jokey Trapped in the Closet series airs on the Independent Film Channel and features Will Oldham — that has these other hallmarks of “art” that read to a white, hipster, indie-rock audience, then, because we are not taking certain things seriously, we can choose not to take the lives of these young black women seriously.\n\nIt puts it in the realm of camp or kitsch. If you have an emotional reaction to a work of art and you use all your skills as a critic to back it up with evidence and context. That’s all we can ask of anybody. We’re all viewing art differently. The joy is in the conversation. Pitchfork is the premier critical organ in the United States for smart discussion of music, books, and artists, but it doesn’t have this discussion. The site reviews his records but doesn’t have the conversation about, “What does it say for us to like his music?”\n\nI think, again, everybody has to individually answer. I can still listen to Led Zeppelin and take joy in Led Zeppelin or James Brown. I condemn the things they did. I’m not reminded constantly in the art, because the art is not about it. But if you’re listening to “I want to marry you, pussy,” and not realizing that he said that to Aaliyah, who was 14, and making an album he named Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number — I had Aaliyah’s mother cry on my shoulder and say her daughter’s life was ruined, Aaliyah’s life was never the same after that. That’s not an experience you’ve had. I’m not expecting you to feel the same way I do. But you can look at this body of evidence. “You” meaning everybody who cares.\n\nYou told me about the night after your critical review of R. Kelly’s performance at Pitchfork ran, one of these women called you at 2 a.m.\n\nThis happens a lot. If you are a good reporter, you are accessible to people and you cannot turn a story off. And that sucks! The number of times since I began this R. Kelly story that I was called in the middle of the night, was talking to someone on Christmas Eve or on New Year’s Day or Thanksgiving. … Yeah, I got a call from one of the women after the Pitchfork festival review. “I know we haven’t spoken in a long time,” and said thank you for still caring and thank you for writing this story, because nobody gives a shit.\n\nIt was a horrible day and a horrible couple of weeks when he was acquitted. The women I heard from who I’d interviewed, women I’d never interviewed who said, “I didn’t come forward, I never spoke to you before, I wish I had now that son of a bitch got off.” Jesus Christ. Rape-victim advocates — I don’t believe in God — they do God’s work. These young women who volunteer to be in the emergency room and sit with a woman throughout the horrible process, I don’t do that. I’m not saying I’m even in the same universe. But somebody calls you up and says I want to talk about this, or thank you about writing this, or, “I can’t sleep because I’m haunted, can you hear what I want to tell you?” We do that as a human being. I would like to forget about this story. I’m not saying I’m super reporter. I’m saying this was a huge story. Where was everybody else?\n\nThere is a disregard for your ongoing concern about this. “Let this go, Jim. Get over it, Jim. He was acquitted.” You have never dropped this, and your peers are pissed because it puts the rest of us over a barrel. I can speak to this, too. It’s often uncool to be the person who gives a shit.\n\n“You’re jealous of R. Kelly, you’re trying to make your name off his career.”\n\nBecause you would love nothing more than to have to report and carry these stories of rape.\n\nRapes, plural. It is on record. Rapes in the dozen. So stop hedging your words, and when you tell me what a brilliant ode to pussy Black Panties is, then realize that the next sentence should say: “This, from a man who has committed numerous rapes.” The guy was a monster! Just say it! We do have a justice system and he was acquitted. OK, fine. And these other women took the civil lawsuit route. He was tried on very narrow grounds. He was tried on a 29-minute, 36-second videotape. He was tried on trading child pornography. He was not tried for rape. He was acquitted of making child pornography. He’s never been tried in court for rape, but look at the statistics. The numbers of rapes that happened, the numbers of rapes that were reported, the numbers of rapes that make it to court and then the conviction rate. I mean, it comes down to something minuscule. He’s never had his day in court as a rapist. It’s 15 years in the past now, but this record exists. You have to make a choice, as a listener, if music matters to you as more than mere entertainment. And you and I have spent our entire lives with that conviction. This is not just entertainment, this is our lifeblood. This matters.\n\nJessica Hopper is a freelance music and culture critic and the author of The Girls Guide to Rocking.\n\nRead the court files and all of Jim DeRogatis’ Sun-Times reporting on the case against R.

        "text": "A Cook County jury on Friday acquitted R&B superstar R. Kelly of child pornography charges, marking the end of a high-profile trial rich in courtroom drama and celebrity intrigue.\n\nThe 41-year-old singer, whose real name is Robert Kelly, long denied charges that he videotaped himself engaging in a variety of sex acts with his then-underage goddaughter.\n\nAuthorities said the female in the video could have been as young as 13 at the time. The jury of nine men and three women deliberated for 7 1/2 hours before finding Kelly not guilty on all 14 counts.\n\nKelly prayed in the courtroom in the moments before the verdict was announced.\n\nAs the verdicts kept coming in, each count not guilty, Kelly's attorney Sam Adam Jr. said he heard Kelly saying \"Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.\"\n\nAdam said his client \"was found not guilty because they had the best jury that Cook County could produce. Two things happened today. R. Kelly got his name back and [his goddaughter] never had to lose hers.\"\n\nCook County State's Atty. Dick Devine called the case unusual because the alleged victim denied being the woman in the video. Sometimes, the community has to press forward with the cases anyway, Devine said.\n\n\"If we acquire the same evidence today or tomorrow, we will bring that case,\" he said.\n\nKelly left the courtroom surrounded by his entourage, who kept reporters away from the singer and escorted him to a waiting SUV as some 50 supporters shouted support to him.\n\nThough Kelly did not speak to reporters, he did salute and wave to fans.\n\nAllan Mayer, a Kelly spokesman, spoke on the singer's behalf, saying, \"Robert has said all along that he believes in our system, and he believes in God. And that when all the facts came out in court, he'd be cleared of these terrible charges.\n\n\"He did not expect that it would take 6 1/2 years. It's been a terrible ordeal for him and his family, and at this point all he wants to do is move forward and try to put it behind him. He wants to thank his lawyers who defended him so brilliantly. He wants to thank his fans who stuck by him and supported him with such love.\n\n\" ... He's going to have more to say about all of this very soon. But for right now, he'd be more inclined to be with his family, collect himself and get strong again. But we'll be hearing from him soon about all of this.\"\n\nThe spokesman declined to take questions.\n\nKelly's SUV drove to Douglas Park on Chicago's West Side, where a tour bus was waiting for him and his entourage. There, Kelly, his entourage and his defense team exchanged hugs and handshakes.\n\nThe defense team was ecstatic with the verdict, calling it a major victory for an innocent man.\n\nEd Genson, Kelly's lead attorney, said he has \"graduated from late middle age to senior citizen on this case. Now I am going to get a little sleep.\"\n\nANALYZE THIS ...\n\nRedEye asked private criminal defense attorney Tamara Holder, who is not connected to the case, for her take on the R. Kelly trial, which ended Friday with the jury acquitting the singer on all counts. Holder speculated that the outcome was a result of prosecutors' failure to overcome two major hurdles:\n\n* Questions about the origin and the quality of the tape central to the trial may have canceled out its power, according to Holder.\n\n\"I would have had the most amazing expert testify and to have done any kind of analysis possible,\" Holder said. \"That's what [prosecutors] should have done instead of playing the tape and talking about it.\"\n\n* Jurors could have been suspicious as to why the alleged victim didn't get summoned by the prosecution, Holder said.\n\n\"If the victim is alive, the prosecution has got to get the victim to testify ... they should have that in the six years it took to try this case,\" Holder said. [KYRA KYLES, REDEYE]\n\nTRIAL TIMELINE\n\nFRIDAY'S VERDICT ENDS A BIZARRE CASE THAT HAD LANGUISHED FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS. HERE'S A LOOK BACK:\n\nFeb. 2002\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times receives a videotape that allegedly shows R. Kelly having sex with a girl who may have been as young as 13.\n\nJune 2002\n\nR. Kelly is charged with 21 counts of child pornography for allegedly making a videotaping of himself engaging in sexual acts with a minor.\n\nFeb. 2004\n\nCook County prosecutors drop seven of 21 child pornography charges.\n\nFeb. 2007\n\nTrial is postponed after Kelly undergoes emergency surgery for a burst appendix.\n\nMay 2008\n\nJury selection begins, with the trial starting on May 20. In opening statements, prosecutors show the controversial videotape.\n\nThursday\n\nThe trial comes to a close with the prosecution again showing the videotape -- central to the case -- in closing arguments to jurors and a courtroom crowded with spectators, as well as international and local media.\n\nFriday\n\nAfter 7 1/2 hours of deliberating, the jury acquits R. Kelly. [REDEYE]",

        "text": "Sebastian Kim\n\nAnother baffling mystery explained (sort of).\n\nIn GQ’s recent interview with R. Kelly, he addressed many of the troubling mysteries that have surrounded him over the years—albeit often in ways that only seemed to suggest even stranger and deeper puzzles about who he really is. But even a 11,000-word article couldn’t contain everything that Kelly discussed over those three days in Chicago.\n\nOne particular conversation covered something that has left plenty of people baffled, vexed, and incensed over the years: the way that, at the height of his legal issues involving alleged sexual predation, Kelly began referring to himself as “the Pied Piper of R&B.” It was startling enough that he continued to release highly sexualized records, though this could at least be presented as the stubborn refusal of an innocent man to change his style. But calling himself “the Pied Piper of R&B,” of all things—to many people, it just seemed as if he was taunting everyone.\n\nIn truth, Kelly seems completely bemused when—sitting on the ninety-ninth floor of the Sears Tower toward the end of our first meeting—I bring this up, and he appears to have no idea why I have done so.\n\n“I started calling myself the Pied Piper,” he explains, “when I started using the flute sound in my music.” He starts listing songs in which he used it. (He mentions “Fiesta” and “Snake”; I mention “Step in the Name of Love,” the first of his own songs where he actually refers to himself by this name.) “I was the Pied Piper. You know, blew a flute. I started calling myself the Pied Piper because of the flute.”\n\nBut, I say, did you understand why people thought that was strange?\n\n“Absolutely not,” he replies. “I was just thinking about the flute, you know.”\n\nBut, I continue, you know the story of the Pied Piper?\n\nHe shakes his head. “I don’t really know the story of the Pied Piper. I don’t read stories, first of all. I just remember either a rabbit or a rat leading people out of the village with a flute.” And he laughs at the thought. “That’s all I can tell you.”\n\nSo now I have the surreal experience of explaining to someone who has been calling himself “the Pied Piper of R&B”—for over a decade, through a parade of underage-sex accusations—the fable of the Pied Piper, as it is most often told and as I know it: how the Piper was hired by the people of Hamelin to lure away all of the town’s rats with his music and then, when he did so and the adults of Hamelin refused to pay him, how the Pied Piper took revenge by luring away all of their children and killing them.",

        "text": "The R. Kelly Problem He’s a musical geniusand he’s been accused of some awful things. Is it okay to listen to him?\n\nR. Kelly whirls around, straining to look out his car’s rear window. You see that? asks the R&B star, sitting in the middle row of a black SUV cruising down Manhattan’s West Side. On this sparkling afternoon in early fall, he’s just noticed a young woman driving a red sedan one lane over. Damn, says Kelly, as the smoke from his cigar curls along his giant gold watch and up past his diamond earring. Uhm-hmm, says a bearded assistant in a baseball cap from the backseat. This man’s job, as best I can tell, is to light his boss’s cigar and carry around a small duffel bag. The SUV pulls even with the woman’s car, and Kelly, on his way to a Chelsea recording studio, goes quiet, staring at the woman as she looks straight ahead.\n\nOur driver changes lanes. Kelly grimaces, as if seeing an attractive woman in a passing car and not being able to do anything about it hurts. New York got a lotta pretty girls, he says. His assistant gives a sleepy nod.\n\nThe SUV pulls in front of the studio. We’re here to listen to tracks from next month’s The Buffet, the 13th album of Kelly’s massively successful, extremely controversial career, and the first one since allegations of his past sexual misconduct resurfaced online, causing many to argue that Kelly is both a predator overdue for punishment and a walking moral dilemma.\n\nWe step into an elevator. As it rises, Kelly, tall and wearing patterned jeans, sunglasses, and a baggy gray hoodie that mostly hides his slight middle-aged paunch, points his cigar at me. You gonna be asking me all these things, he says. So let me ask you something first: What do you call a black man who flies an airplane?\n\nI don’t know.\n\nYou call him a pilot, says Kelly. What’s wrong with you? He laughs. Gotta keep you off balance, he says. Gotta set the tone.\n\nSo let’s do that. Here are some key things to know about R. Kelly. His first name is Robert, he’s 48 years old, and he’s inarguably the biggest male R&B singer since Marvin Gaye. Probably the most talented and sexually explicit, too. He grew up poor and functionally ­illiterateowing to dyslexiaon Chicago’s South Side, raised mostly by his mother. In his memoir, Soulacoaster: The Diary of Me, he wrote about being sexually abused as a child by a woman from the neighborhood. Around the same time, boarders in his family’s house repeatedly made him take photos of them having sex. When he was 8, he watched helplessly as his first love, Lulu, drowned after bullies pushed her into a creek. At 11, he was shot by thieves trying to steal his bike. The bullet is still in his shoulder.\n\nKelly was musical from as far back as he can remember, and he began his career on the streets, singing for money in his clear, gorgeous tenor. In 1991, he joined a New Jack Swing group, Public Announcement, and went solo soon after. His debut, 12 Play (as opposed, the logic goes, to a less capable lover’s foreplay), was released in 1993. Since then, Kelly has sold somewhere in the neighborhood of 34 million albums. He’s been nominated for 25 Grammy Awards and won three. In 2010, Billboard named Kelly the No. 1 R&B and hip-hop artist of the last quarter-­century. In addition to his own batch of 33 sinuous, perfectly arranged top-20 R&B hit singles, and another 17 that achieved the same designation on the pop Hot 100, Kelly has collaborated on smashes with Céline Dion and Michael Jackson. Pitchfork deemed his irresistible Ignition (Remix) the 19th-best track of the aughts. He was largely responsible for introducing Aaliyah, Drake’s emotional lodestar, to the world. Even Jim DeRogatis, the former Chicago Sun-Times reporter and pop critic, who has done more than anyone else to spread the word on Kelly’s alleged unlawful sexual behavior, admits: The man is a musical genius.\n\nThat’s the music. There’s also this: a long list of allegations that Kelly has used his money and power to have sex with minors. In 1994, when Kelly was 27 and Aaliyah was 15, the two were married under a falsified document that stated she was 18. The marriage was quickly annulled and Kelly, who produced Aaliyah’s debut albumcalled Age Ain’t Nothing But a Numberhasn’t said much about it since, out of, he says, respect for the late singer’s family. (Aaliyah had signed an agreement requiring her to stay silent about the brief marriage.) In 1996, Kelly was sued for damages by a woman alleging the two began a sexual relationship when she was 15. Kelly settled out of court. In 2001, a similar lawsuit with a similar result. The next year, he was indicted on 21 counts of making child pornography after police came into possession of a video depicting a man resembling Kelly having sex with a young woman. Also in 2002, another lawsuit, this one from a woman claiming both that Kelly impregnated her while she was underage and that one of his associates took her to get an abortion. Kelly settled. That same year, a woman sued Kelly for filming, without her knowledge, the two having sex. Kelly settled. It goes on: at least a half-dozen more lawsuits, followed by settlements, followed by nondisclosure agreements. (There are also reportedly a handful of instances in which Kelly has agreed to payments before lawsuits were even filed. Presumably these, too, involve NDAs.)",

        "text": "Kelly was so affronted by the line of questioning that he up and left the studio -- but not before he commented on Modarressy-Tehrani's appearance, wondered whether she knew what the word \"deposition\" meant and questioned her level of intelligence. The only silver lining was that we got to see Modarressy-Tehrani keep her calm while being berated for asking the questions that any reporter should. (Watch a selection of clips from the interview below.)\n\nR. Kelly got a bit miffed Monday afternoon when HuffPost Live host Caroline Modarressy-Tehrani questioned the artist about how the sexual assault allegations against him impact the way fans consume his music.\n\nIn the midst of Kelly's deflection and abject horror that a reporter would deign to be anything but \"positive\" about him and his career, Modarressy-Tehrani responded like a boss. When Kelly called her a \"beautiful woman,\" she reminded him, \"You don't have to comment on my appearance, sir.\" When he continuously cut her off, she told him, \"Now let me do my job for a second because I haven't been able to ask you a question for a moment,\" before pressing him on the topics he'd been dodging.\n\nAsking the tough questions -- even when they don't have clear or comfortable answers -- is exactly what reporters are tasked with doing.\n\nA little background: Kelly has been accused of sexual assault by dozens of young women -- many of them in the context of lawsuits, many of them minors. The story was first reported in December 2000 by Chicago Sun-Times reporters Jim DeRogatis and Abdon M. Pallasch. In the years since, as the Village Voice reported in 2013, DeRogatis has \"interview[ed] hundreds of people...including dozens of young women whose lives DeRogatis says were ruined by the singer.\"\n\nIn that same Village Voice interview, published just after Kelly's \"Black Panties\" album dropped, DeRogatis calls the lawsuits against Kelly \"stomach-churning.\" As he told the Village Voice's Jessica Hopper:\n\nI think in the history of rock 'n' roll, rock music, or pop culture people misbehaving and behaving badly sexually with young women, rare is the amount of evidence compiled against anyone apart from R. Kelly. Dozens of girls -- not one, not two, dozens -- with harrowing lawsuits. The videotapes -- and not just one videotape, numerous videotapes... You watch the video for which he was indicted and there is the disembodied look of the rape victim. He orders her to call him Daddy. He urinates in her mouth and instructs her at great length on how to position herself to receive his \"gift.\" It's a rape that you're watching. So we're not talking about rock star misbehavior, which men or women can do. We're talking about predatory behavior. Their lives were ruined.\n\nA note to famous people seeking media promotion: If you've been accused of assaulting multiple minors, be prepared to be questioned about it.\n\nAs Modarressy-Tehrani told Kelly after he repeatedly dodged her questions but offered his \"love,\" \"You don't need to give me any of your love, sir...I just wanted to ask the question.\"\n\nHead over to HuffPost Live to watch the full interview.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:",

        "text": "That's not how I'm doing this. First, if he isn't prepared to engage in some kind of serious discussion on the more difficult parts of his life, then I can't see how there can be a significant article about R. Kelly in 2016 that is worth printing. Second, it would make me feel spineless and undignified. I've read, listened to, and watched every other R. Kelly interview I could find, and too often what happens is that if interviewers mention anything at all, what they do is make a perfunctory little raid on the subject, touching it just to say they did. Why play around? He knows, at least to some degree, what's coming. He's a grown man, 48 years old. He's stood on a thousand stages and sat through a criminal trial. I know it's not going to be a comfortable conversation, but surely the most respectful way to have it is to get on and have it.\n\nSo, walking in here, that is my plan.\n\nThe ninety-ninth floor appears to be completely bare. In the huge rectangular room where we meet, there are only two places to sit. One is on some sofas over in the far corner. Kelly chooses the other option. And so we sit facing each other, at a small round table set in the middle of the large empty space on the lakeward side of the tower, glass on three sides of us. It looks like a surreal over-the-top set for an interrogation scene in an action movie. Before we begin, Kelly tries to prop up his phone on the table between us, to record the conversation—I am as well—but it keeps sliding and falling over. First of all, before anything else, I want to talk with him about his childhood, and in particular some tough aspects of it that seem central to whom he has become. For one thing, his inability to read.\n\n“Other kids could read, other kids could write, other kids could spell, they could do math,” he says. “I felt like an alien, I felt like an outcast. I felt like, ‘What is going to happen to me?’ My mother couldn't answer it. My stepfather wasn't really interested in it one way or another. And my brothers and sisters were so young at the time they wouldn't do nothing but tease me about it. I was the ‘dummy’: ‘How you gon’ do this? You can't even read!' ”\n\nHe says it's not like he didn't try, and he describes what would happen when he did: “I would always hear scrambled music, like an orchestra going off that didn't know what they was doing. It was so confusing. It was, like, violin's playing ‘I Believe I Can Fly,’ the bass is playing ‘When a Woman's Fed Up,’ the guitar's playing ‘Bump N' Grind,’ the piano's playing a gospel song. And then I would end up getting really sleepy and tired.”\n\nReading remains a struggle. “Since my daughter showed me voice texts on my phone, I've gotten a lot better,” he says. “I'm not a A student, I'm not even a B student, but I've gotten a lot better with the reading because of texts. And I can voice-text and say whatever I want to people. And then they text me back and I take my time and I can read through it.”\n\nR. Kelly Sings the Story of His Life, the Abridged Version\n\nEarly on, Kelly faced other challenges. He grew up without a father, gone before Kelly was born, and his mother wouldn't talk about him. “That's the one thing,” he says to me. “If I could change anything, I would definitely have had a father around. My father. I would definitely say it affected me deeply as a young man, coming up. Who doesn't want a father? Those are the beginnings, and those are what can dictate the roads you choose in life, and choosing them well. And it affected me.”\n\nKelly had a deep, close relationship with his mother, but he says even she never knew everything that was going on in her young son's turbulent life. He says that until he mentioned it in his 2012 memoir, Soulacoaster, he had never told anyone at all about the sexual abuse that he experienced. (Not even his ex-wife Andrea? “Absolutely not.”) It was something he “put so far in the back of my mind that I even forgot about it.” This wasn't the history he wanted for the person he was becoming: “As I got older, the more I just didn't want it to be in my past. The more I became successful.” He was determined that the R. Kelly the world would know—the one who would sell more than 30 million albums, have 36 Billboard Hot 100 hits, invent his own strange musical language, write hits for countless others, and conceive one of the weirdest syntheses of video and music of all time, Trapped in the Closet—would be someone else. “I didn't want that to be something that was in my luggage once I got to my success home, so to speak.”\n\nIn the book, he describes a number of premature sexual experiences, including an approach by a trusted family friend, a man, who he says tried to persuade Kelly to masturbate him for money, which Kelly says he rebuffed. “It was a crazy weird experience,” he tells me. “But not a full-blown experience, because it didn't go down. Contact sexual—no. A visual—absolutely. A visual from him showing me his penis and all that stuff.” But he describes in his memoir how the full-on sexual abuse that lasted for several years (it was oral sex the first time, though he tells me it soon became intercourse) started one day when Kelly fell asleep in front of the TV and was awoken from “a crazy dream about Three's Company” to find a woman playing with him:",

Or perhaps convincing a ragtag group of cartoons led by Michael Jordan to believe they can fly, if not educating you in the finer arts of jubilantly celebrating the freakin’ weekend. But now the infamous musician has taken on a brand new role, giving all of these Instagram It-Girls a run for their money as the newest star of Alexander Wang‘s Spring/Summer 2017 digital campaign alongside model and brand-favorite Anna Ewers.\n\nThe campaign for the designer’s latest collection was shot by famed photographers Inez and Vinoodh in the penthouse of the Old Police Building in downtown Manhattan. According to a press release for the campaign aptly titled, “Beyond Reality,” the images are meant to “blur the lines between fantasy and reality, presenting a unique observation on the superficial with a though-provoking commentary on society’s current obsessions with speculation: did that happen, did it not? What was real and what was fabricated?”\n\nRELATED: Meet R. Kelly’s Secret Soulmate: Stanley Kubrick?\n\nThe photos themselves feature R. Kelly wearing an all-black suit with no tie, a striped scarf, and his signature shades all while smoking a cigar and lounging side-by-side with Ewers who wears a big, white fur coat and crystal-covered bucket bag while smoking a cigarette.\n\nThe photos were taken during a giant party Wang held in the building on December 7 in collaboration with Beats by Dr. Dre to celebrate the launch of his second headphone collaboration.\n\nIn the end, we can’t decide what we’re more excited about, R. Kelly’s promising new career as a burgeoning supermodel, or the additional 4o chapters of his seminal hip-hopera “Trapped in the Closet” that he has assured the public are forthcoming. Only time will tell.\n\nWhat do you think of R. Kelly joining the #WANGSQUAD? Who would you like to see become a member next? Sound off below!",

        "text": "It has been nearly 15 years since music journalist Jim DeRogatis caught the story that has since defined his career, one that he wishes didn’t exist: R. Kelly’s sexual predation on teenage girls. DeRogatis, at that time the pop-music critic at the Chicago Sun-Times, was anonymously delivered the first of two videos he would receive depicting the pop star engaging in sexual acts with underage girls. Now the host of the syndicated public radio show Sound Opinions and a professor at Columbia College, DeRogatis, along with his former Sun-Times colleague Abdon Pallasch, didn’t just break the story, they did the only significant reporting on the accusations against Kelly, interviewing hundreds of people over the years, including dozens of young women whose lives DeRogatis says were ruined by the singer.\n\nThis past summer, leading up to Kelly’s headlining performance at the Pitchfork Music Festival, DeRogatis posted a series of discussions about Kelly’s career, the charges made against him, and sexual assault. He published a live review of the singer’s festival set that was an indictment of Pitchfork and its audience for essentially endorsing a man he calls “a monster.” In the two weeks since Kelly released his latest studio album, Black Panties, the conversation about him and why he has gotten a pass from music publications (not to mention feminist sites such as Jezebel) has been rekindled, in part because of the explicit nature of the album and also because of online arguments around the Pitchfork performance.\n\nI was one of those people who challenged DeRogatis and was even flip about his judgment — something I quickly came to regret. DeRogatis and I have tangled — even feuded on air — over the years; yet, amid the Twitter barbs, he approached me offline and told me about how one of Kelly’s victims called him in the middle of the night after his Pitchfork review came out, to thank him for caring when no one else did. He told me of mothers crying on his shoulder, seeing the scars of a suicide attempt on a girl’s wrists, the fear in their eyes. He detailed an aftermath that the public has never had to bear witness to.\n\nDeRogatis offered to give me access to every file and transcript he has collected in reporting this story — as he has to other reporters and journalists, none of whom has ever looked into the matter, thus relegating it to one man’s personal crusade.\n\nI thought that last fact merited a public conversation about why.\n\nIn this interview (which has been condensed significantly), DeRogatis speaks frankly and explicitly about the many disturbing charges against Kelly and says, ultimately, “The saddest fact I’ve learned is nobody matters less to our society than young black women. Nobody.”\n\nRefresh our memories. How did this start for you?\n\nBeing a beat reporter, music critic at a Chicago daily, the Sun-Times, R. Kelly was a huge story for me, this guy who rose from not graduating from Kenwood Academy, singing at backyard barbecues and on the El, to suddenly selling millions of records. I interviewed him a number of times. Then TP2.com came out. I’d written a review that said the jarring thing about Kelly is that one moment he wants to be riding you and then next minute he’s on his knees, crying and praying to his dead mother in Heaven for forgiveness for his unnamed sins. It’s a little weird at times. It’s just an observation.\n\nThe next day at the Sun-Times, we got this anonymous fax — we didn’t know where it came from. It said: R. Kelly’s been under investigation for two years by the sex-crimes unit of the Chicago police. And I threw it on the corner of my desk. I thought, “player-hater.” Now, from the beginning, there were rumors that Kelly likes them young. And there’d been this Aaliyah thing — Vibe printed, without much commentary and no reporting, the marriage certificate. Kelly or someone had falsified her age as 18. There was that. So all this is floating in the air. This fax arrives and I think, “Oh, this is somebody playing with this.” But there was something that nagged at me as a reporter. There were specific names, specific dates, and those great, long Polish cop names. And you’re not going to make that crap up. So I went to the city desk and I asked, “What do we do with this?” They said, Abdon Pallasch is the courts reporter, why don’t you two look into it and see if there’s anything there? And it turns out there had been lawsuits that had been filed that had never been reported.\n\nWhen you cover the courts in Chicago or any city, you go twice a day and you go through the bin of cases that have been filed and every once in a while Michael Jordan’s been sued or someone went bankrupt and it’s this sexy story and you pull it out. These suits had been filed at 4 p.m. on Christmas Eve. Ain’t no reporter working at 4 p.m. on Christmas Eve, and they flew under the radar. So we had these lawsuits that were explosive and we didn’t understand why nobody had reported them.\n\nExplosive in what regard?\n\nThey were stomach-churning. The one young woman, who had been 14 or 15 when R. Kelly began a relationship with her, detailed in great length, in her affidavits, a sexual relationship that began at Kenwood Academy: He would go back in the early years of his success and go to Lina McLin’s gospel choir class. She’s a legend in Chicago, gospel royalty. He would go to her sophomore class and hook up with girls afterward and have sex with them. Sometimes buy them a pair of sneakers. Sometimes just letting them hang out in his presence in the recording studio. She detailed the sexual relationship that she was scarred by. It lasted about one and a half to two years, and then he dumped her and she slit her wrists, tried to kill herself. Other girls were involved. She recruited other girls. He picked up other girls and made them all have sex together. A level of specificity that was pretty disgusting.\n\nHer lawsuit was hundreds of pages long, and Kelly countersued. The countersuit was, like, 10 pages long: “None of this is true!” We began our reporting. We knocked on a lot of doors. The lawsuits, the two that we had found initially, had been settled. Kelly had paid the women and their families money and the settlements were sealed by the court. But of course, the initial lawsuits remain part of the public record.\n\nSo her affidavit, this testimony — it’s all public record?\n\nTo this day, any reporter who so cares can go to Cook County and pull these records, so it drives me crazy, even with some of the eloquent reconsiderations we’ve seen of Kelly in recent days, that they keep saying “rumors” and “allegations”. Well, “allegations” is fair, OK. You’re protected as a reporter, any lawsuit that has been filed as fact. The contents of the lawsuit are protected. So these were not rumors. These were allegations made in court.\n\nDo you think part of how it’s been handled and why it’s been under-reported is that music writers may not know how to deal with it in a journalistic sense?\n\nLet’s start with the most mundane part. A lot of people who are critics are fans and don’t come with any academic background, with any journalistic background, research background. Now, nobody knows everything, and far be it from me to say you’ve got to be a journalist or you have to have studied critical theory in the academy. Part of what we do is journalistic. Get the names right, get the dates right, get the facts right. Sometimes, on a very rare number of stories, there’s a deeper level of reporting required.\n\nThere’s another reason: People are squeamish. I think a lot of people don’t know how to do it, don’t care to do it, and it’s way too much work. It’s just kind of disgusting to have to write about this and bum everyone out when you just want to review a record.\n\nYou and I got into it over Twitter around Pitchfork, in part over the fact that you were saying, “If you are enjoying R. Kelly, you are effectively cosigning what this man has done.” At the time, I was being defensive, saying people can like what they like.\n\nTo be clear, I think Pitchfork was cosigning it. I think each and every one of us, as individual listeners and consumers of culture, has to come up with our own answer. I don’t think there’s a right or wrong answer. The thing that’s interesting to me is that Pitchfork is a journalistic and critical organ. They do journalism and they do criticism. And then when they are making money to present an act — that’s a cosign, that’s an endorsement. That’s not just writing about and covering it. They very much wanted R. Kelly as their cornerstone artist for the festival. I think it’s fair game to say: “Why, Pitchfork?”\n\nI had purposely not listened to his music since the initial charges came out, and I saw these ninth- and 10th-grade girls interviewed on TV, talking about how he was in the parking lot of their school every day and everyone knew how come. That is what it took for me.\n\nPart of our reporting was sitting with those girls, sitting with their families, seeing their scars on their wrists, hearing the emotion.\n\nSome of our young critical peers, they’re 24 and all they know of Kelly’s past is some vague sense of scandal, because they were introduced to him as kids via Space Jam. A lot of your reporting on this is not online, it is not Google-able. Collective memory is that he “just” peed in a girl’s mouth.\n\nTo be fair, I teach 20-year-olds at Columbia. Ignorance is nothing to be ashamed of. Nobody knows everything. A lot of art, great art, is made by despicable people. James Brown beat his wife. People are always, “Why aren’t you upset about Led Zeppelin?” I got the Bonham three rings [tattooed] on my foot. Led Zeppelin did disgusting things. I read Hammer of the Gods, I’m disgusted by the group sex with the shark. [Note: it was actually a red snapper! Still gross.] I have a couple of responses to that: I didn’t cover Led Zeppelin. If I was on the plane, like Cameron Crowe was, I would have written about those things if I saw them.\n\nThe art very rarely talks about these things. There are not pro-rape Led Zeppelin songs. There are not pro-wife-beating James Brown songs. I think in the history of rock ‘n’ roll, rock music, or pop culture people misbehaving and behaving badly sexually with young women, rare is the amount of evidence compiled against anyone apart from R. Kelly. Dozens of girls — not one, not two, dozens — with harrowing lawsuits. The videotapes — and not just one videotape, numerous videotapes. And not Tommy Lee/Pam Anderson, Kardashian fun video. You watch the video for which he was indicted and there is the disembodied look of the rape victim. He orders her to call him Daddy. He urinates in her mouth and instructs her at great length on how to position herself to receive his “gift.” It’s a rape that you’re watching. So we’re not talking about rock star misbehavior, which men or women can do. We’re talking about predatory behavior. Their lives were ruined. Read the lawsuits!\n\nAnd there was a young woman who was pressured into an abortion?\n\nThat he paid for. There was a young woman that he picked up on the evening of her prom. The relationship lasted a year and a half or two years. Impregnated her, paid for her abortion, had his goons drive her. None of which she wanted. She sued him. The saddest fact I’ve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women. Nobody. They have any complaint about the way they are treated: They are “bitches, hos, and gold-diggers,” plain and simple. Kelly never misbehaved with a single white girl who sued him or that we know of. Mark Anthony Neal, the African-American scholar, makes this point : one white girl in Winnetka and the story would have been different.\n\nNo, it was young black girls and all of them settled. They settled because they felt they could get no justice whatsoever. They didn’t have a chance.\n\nAnd they learned that after putting these suits forth and having them get nowhere? Do you think they didn’t get traction because of the representation they had, or Kelly’s power? Were certain elements in concert with that?\n\nI think it was a lot of things, including the fact that Kelly was fully capable of intimidating people. These girls feared for their lives. They feared for the safety of their families. And these people talked to me not because I’m super reporter — we rang a lot of doorbells on the South and West sides, and people were eager to talk about this guy, because they wanted him to stop!\n\nGoing back a little bit to our original question: You get this tape dropped in the mail …\n\nWell, the tape came a year after we ran the first story. We ran this story and the world shrugged. Associated Press picks it up: “Chicago Sun-Times has reported a pattern of sexual predation of young women by Robert Kelly,” and everybody says, “Ah, well, OK.” Then one day I get this call that says: “Go to your mailbox. There’s this manila envelope with a videotape in it.”\n\nWe had gotten one videotape already after the first story, and we gave it to the police. When I say “we,” I mean a roomful of editors sitting around asking, “What is the right thing to do here? This would seem to be evidence of a felony, we should give it to police.” There was one tape, but the police could not determine the girl’s age. The forensic experts they had looking at it said judging by the soles of her feet, they could tell she was 13 or 14 at the time this tape was made, but we can’t identify who the woman is. Videotape No. 1.\n\nThere were tapes on the street. And I had heard of another video tape with a girl who was part of an ongoing relationship. This is the girl who was in the tape that was in the lawsuit.\n\nAnd some 40 people testified that it was her?\n\nYeah. Coaches, best friend’s parents, pastor, half the family, grandmother, aunt — but the mother and father never testified, the girl never testified. When we wrote our story about the tape, the girl and mother and father took a six-month vacation to the south of France. We’d been to the house several times. We’d rung the doorbell. This was an aluminum-siding, lower-middle-class house on the South Side, with a station wagon which is 13 years old — you know what I mean? And now they’re in the south of France. And one time the dad got a credit as a bass player on an R. Kelly album. He didn’t play bass.\n\nThe situations are incredibly complicated, and sometimes there is an element of, “We’re gonna exploit this situation for our favor.” That doesn’t mean that it’s legal or it’s right or that girl wasn’t harmed. It tore that family apart.\n\nHow many people do you think you’ve interviewed? How many people came forward?\n\nI think in the end there were two dozen women with various level of details. Obviously the women who were part of the hundreds of pages of lawsuits — hell of a lot of details. There were girls who just told one simple story, and there were a lot of girls who told stories that lasted hours which still make me sick to my stomach. It never was one girl on one tape. Or one girl and Aaliyah.\n\nThe other thing, the thing that people seem to not know: She was fresh out of eighth grade in this tape.\n\nFourteen or 15. That puts a perspective on it. She’s not sophisticated enough to know what her kinks are.\n\nLet’s talk about what it is, aside from not just having reportorial chops, that might hold somebody back. I feel that a lot of younger journalists came up through blogs, not journalism school. They are fearful to write about it because they don’t know what they can say, what language they can use, if they can be sued for even acknowledging charges.\n\nYou may not know how to report, but you should know how to read. The Sun-Times was never sued for the hundreds of thousands of words that it wrote about R. Kelly. You cannot be sued for repeating anything that is in a lawsuit. You cannot be sued for repeating anything that was said during the six- or seven-week trial. It’s in his record, and then there’s Kelly’s own words. Then read [Kelly’s biography] Soulacoaster. It was not a pleasant experience for me to read Soulacoaster! But read it, and read what he says in his own book! Do your goddamn homework!\n\nWhat are the other factors?\n\nHere’s the most sinister. This deeply troubles me: There’s a very — I don’t know what the percentage is — some percentage of fans are liking Kelly’s music because they know. And that’s really troublesome to me. There is some sort of — and this is tied up to complicated questions of racism and sexism — there is some sort of vicarious thrill to seeing this guy play this character in these songs and knowing that it’s not just a character.\n\nSongs like “Sexasaurus” kind of makes it novel. The ironic, jokey Trapped in the Closet series airs on the Independent Film Channel and features Will Oldham — that has these other hallmarks of “art” that read to a white, hipster, indie-rock audience, then, because we are not taking certain things seriously, we can choose not to take the lives of these young black women seriously.\n\nIt puts it in the realm of camp or kitsch. If you have an emotional reaction to a work of art and you use all your skills as a critic to back it up with evidence and context. That’s all we can ask of anybody. We’re all viewing art differently. The joy is in the conversation. Pitchfork is the premier critical organ in the United States for smart discussion of music, books, and artists, but it doesn’t have this discussion. The site reviews his records but doesn’t have the conversation about, “What does it say for us to like his music?”\n\nI think, again, everybody has to individually answer. I can still listen to Led Zeppelin and take joy in Led Zeppelin or James Brown. I condemn the things they did. I’m not reminded constantly in the art, because the art is not about it. But if you’re listening to “I want to marry you, pussy,” and not realizing that he said that to Aaliyah, who was 14, and making an album he named Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number — I had Aaliyah’s mother cry on my shoulder and say her daughter’s life was ruined, Aaliyah’s life was never the same after that. That’s not an experience you’ve had. I’m not expecting you to feel the same way I do. But you can look at this body of evidence. “You” meaning everybody who cares.\n\nYou told me about the night after your critical review of R. Kelly’s performance at Pitchfork ran, one of these women called you at 2 a.m.\n\nThis happens a lot. If you are a good reporter, you are accessible to people and you cannot turn a story off. And that sucks! The number of times since I began this R. Kelly story that I was called in the middle of the night, was talking to someone on Christmas Eve or on New Year’s Day or Thanksgiving. … Yeah, I got a call from one of the women after the Pitchfork festival review. “I know we haven’t spoken in a long time,” and said thank you for still caring and thank you for writing this story, because nobody gives a shit.\n\nIt was a horrible day and a horrible couple of weeks when he was acquitted. The women I heard from who I’d interviewed, women I’d never interviewed who said, “I didn’t come forward, I never spoke to you before, I wish I had now that son of a bitch got off.” Jesus Christ. Rape-victim advocates — I don’t believe in God — they do God’s work. These young women who volunteer to be in the emergency room and sit with a woman throughout the horrible process, I don’t do that. I’m not saying I’m even in the same universe. But somebody calls you up and says I want to talk about this, or thank you about writing this, or, “I can’t sleep because I’m haunted, can you hear what I want to tell you?” We do that as a human being. I would like to forget about this story. I’m not saying I’m super reporter. I’m saying this was a huge story. Where was everybody else?\n\nThere is a disregard for your ongoing concern about this. “Let this go, Jim. Get over it, Jim. He was acquitted.” You have never dropped this, and your peers are pissed because it puts the rest of us over a barrel. I can speak to this, too. It’s often uncool to be the person who gives a shit.\n\n“You’re jealous of R. Kelly, you’re trying to make your name off his career.”\n\nBecause you would love nothing more than to have to report and carry these stories of rape.\n\nRapes, plural. It is on record. Rapes in the dozen. So stop hedging your words, and when you tell me what a brilliant ode to pussy Black Panties is, then realize that the next sentence should say: “This, from a man who has committed numerous rapes.” The guy was a monster! Just say it! We do have a justice system and he was acquitted. OK, fine. And these other women took the civil lawsuit route. He was tried on very narrow grounds. He was tried on a 29-minute, 36-second videotape. He was tried on trading child pornography. He was not tried for rape. He was acquitted of making child pornography. He’s never been tried in court for rape, but look at the statistics. The numbers of rapes that happened, the numbers of rapes that were reported, the numbers of rapes that make it to court and then the conviction rate. I mean, it comes down to something minuscule. He’s never had his day in court as a rapist. It’s 15 years in the past now, but this record exists. You have to make a choice, as a listener, if music matters to you as more than mere entertainment. And you and I have spent our entire lives with that conviction. This is not just entertainment, this is our lifeblood. This matters.\n\nJessica Hopper is a freelance music and culture critic and the author of The Girls Guide to Rocking.\n\nRead the court files and all of Jim DeRogatis’ Sun-Times reporting on the case against R.

        "text": "A Cook County jury on Friday acquitted R&B superstar R. Kelly of child pornography charges, marking the end of a high-profile trial rich in courtroom drama and celebrity intrigue.\n\nThe 41-year-old singer, whose real name is Robert Kelly, long denied charges that he videotaped himself engaging in a variety of sex acts with his then-underage goddaughter.\n\nAuthorities said the female in the video could have been as young as 13 at the time. The jury of nine men and three women deliberated for 7 1/2 hours before finding Kelly not guilty on all 14 counts.\n\nKelly prayed in the courtroom in the moments before the verdict was announced.\n\nAs the verdicts kept coming in, each count not guilty, Kelly's attorney Sam Adam Jr. said he heard Kelly saying \"Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.\"\n\nAdam said his client \"was found not guilty because they had the best jury that Cook County could produce. Two things happened today. R. Kelly got his name back and [his goddaughter] never had to lose hers.\"\n\nCook County State's Atty. Dick Devine called the case unusual because the alleged victim denied being the woman in the video. Sometimes, the community has to press forward with the cases anyway, Devine said.\n\n\"If we acquire the same evidence today or tomorrow, we will bring that case,\" he said.\n\nKelly left the courtroom surrounded by his entourage, who kept reporters away from the singer and escorted him to a waiting SUV as some 50 supporters shouted support to him.\n\nThough Kelly did not speak to reporters, he did salute and wave to fans.\n\nAllan Mayer, a Kelly spokesman, spoke on the singer's behalf, saying, \"Robert has said all along that he believes in our system, and he believes in God. And that when all the facts came out in court, he'd be cleared of these terrible charges.\n\n\"He did not expect that it would take 6 1/2 years. It's been a terrible ordeal for him and his family, and at this point all he wants to do is move forward and try to put it behind him. He wants to thank his lawyers who defended him so brilliantly. He wants to thank his fans who stuck by him and supported him with such love.\n\n\" ... He's going to have more to say about all of this very soon. But for right now, he'd be more inclined to be with his family, collect himself and get strong again. But we'll be hearing from him soon about all of this.\"\n\nThe spokesman declined to take questions.\n\nKelly's SUV drove to Douglas Park on Chicago's West Side, where a tour bus was waiting for him and his entourage. There, Kelly, his entourage and his defense team exchanged hugs and handshakes.\n\nThe defense team was ecstatic with the verdict, calling it a major victory for an innocent man.\n\nEd Genson, Kelly's lead attorney, said he has \"graduated from late middle age to senior citizen on this case. Now I am going to get a little sleep.\"\n\nANALYZE THIS ...\n\nRedEye asked private criminal defense attorney Tamara Holder, who is not connected to the case, for her take on the R. Kelly trial, which ended Friday with the jury acquitting the singer on all counts. Holder speculated that the outcome was a result of prosecutors' failure to overcome two major hurdles:\n\n* Questions about the origin and the quality of the tape central to the trial may have canceled out its power, according to Holder.\n\n\"I would have had the most amazing expert testify and to have done any kind of analysis possible,\" Holder said. \"That's what [prosecutors] should have done instead of playing the tape and talking about it.\"\n\n* Jurors could have been suspicious as to why the alleged victim didn't get summoned by the prosecution, Holder said.\n\n\"If the victim is alive, the prosecution has got to get the victim to testify ... they should have that in the six years it took to try this case,\" Holder said. [KYRA KYLES, REDEYE]\n\nTRIAL TIMELINE\n\nFRIDAY'S VERDICT ENDS A BIZARRE CASE THAT HAD LANGUISHED FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS. HERE'S A LOOK BACK:\n\nFeb. 2002\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times receives a videotape that allegedly shows R. Kelly having sex with a girl who may have been as young as 13.\n\nJune 2002\n\nR. Kelly is charged with 21 counts of child pornography for allegedly making a videotaping of himself engaging in sexual acts with a minor.\n\nFeb. 2004\n\nCook County prosecutors drop seven of 21 child pornography charges.\n\nFeb. 2007\n\nTrial is postponed after Kelly undergoes emergency surgery for a burst appendix.\n\nMay 2008\n\nJury selection begins, with the trial starting on May 20. In opening statements, prosecutors show the controversial videotape.\n\nThursday\n\nThe trial comes to a close with the prosecution again showing the videotape -- central to the case -- in closing arguments to jurors and a courtroom crowded with spectators, as well as international and local media.\n\nFriday\n\nAfter 7 1/2 hours of deliberating, the jury acquits R. Kelly. [REDEYE]",

        "text": "Sebastian Kim\n\nAnother baffling mystery explained (sort of).\n\nIn GQ’s recent interview with R. Kelly, he addressed many of the troubling mysteries that have surrounded him over the years—albeit often in ways that only seemed to suggest even stranger and deeper puzzles about who he really is. But even a 11,000-word article couldn’t contain everything that Kelly discussed over those three days in Chicago.\n\nOne particular conversation covered something that has left plenty of people baffled, vexed, and incensed over the years: the way that, at the height of his legal issues involving alleged sexual predation, Kelly began referring to himself as “the Pied Piper of R&B.” It was startling enough that he continued to release highly sexualized records, though this could at least be presented as the stubborn refusal of an innocent man to change his style. But calling himself “the Pied Piper of R&B,” of all things—to many people, it just seemed as if he was taunting everyone.\n\nIn truth, Kelly seems completely bemused when—sitting on the ninety-ninth floor of the Sears Tower toward the end of our first meeting—I bring this up, and he appears to have no idea why I have done so.\n\n“I started calling myself the Pied Piper,” he explains, “when I started using the flute sound in my music.” He starts listing songs in which he used it. (He mentions “Fiesta” and “Snake”; I mention “Step in the Name of Love,” the first of his own songs where he actually refers to himself by this name.) “I was the Pied Piper. You know, blew a flute. I started calling myself the Pied Piper because of the flute.”\n\nBut, I say, did you understand why people thought that was strange?\n\n“Absolutely not,” he replies. “I was just thinking about the flute, you know.”\n\nBut, I continue, you know the story of the Pied Piper?\n\nHe shakes his head. “I don’t really know the story of the Pied Piper. I don’t read stories, first of all. I just remember either a rabbit or a rat leading people out of the village with a flute.” And he laughs at the thought. “That’s all I can tell you.”\n\nSo now I have the surreal experience of explaining to someone who has been calling himself “the Pied Piper of R&B”—for over a decade, through a parade of underage-sex accusations—the fable of the Pied Piper, as it is most often told and as I know it: how the Piper was hired by the people of Hamelin to lure away all of the town’s rats with his music and then, when he did so and the adults of Hamelin refused to pay him, how the Pied Piper took revenge by luring away all of their children and killing them.",

        "text": "The R. Kelly Problem He’s a musical geniusand he’s been accused of some awful things. Is it okay to listen to him?\n\nR. Kelly whirls around, straining to look out his car’s rear window. You see that? asks the R&B star, sitting in the middle row of a black SUV cruising down Manhattan’s West Side. On this sparkling afternoon in early fall, he’s just noticed a young woman driving a red sedan one lane over. Damn, says Kelly, as the smoke from his cigar curls along his giant gold watch and up past his diamond earring. Uhm-hmm, says a bearded assistant in a baseball cap from the backseat. This man’s job, as best I can tell, is to light his boss’s cigar and carry around a small duffel bag. The SUV pulls even with the woman’s car, and Kelly, on his way to a Chelsea recording studio, goes quiet, staring at the woman as she looks straight ahead.\n\nOur driver changes lanes. Kelly grimaces, as if seeing an attractive woman in a passing car and not being able to do anything about it hurts. New York got a lotta pretty girls, he says. His assistant gives a sleepy nod.\n\nThe SUV pulls in front of the studio. We’re here to listen to tracks from next month’s The Buffet, the 13th album of Kelly’s massively successful, extremely controversial career, and the first one since allegations of his past sexual misconduct resurfaced online, causing many to argue that Kelly is both a predator overdue for punishment and a walking moral dilemma.\n\nWe step into an elevator. As it rises, Kelly, tall and wearing patterned jeans, sunglasses, and a baggy gray hoodie that mostly hides his slight middle-aged paunch, points his cigar at me. You gonna be asking me all these things, he says. So let me ask you something first: What do you call a black man who flies an airplane?\n\nI don’t know.\n\nYou call him a pilot, says Kelly. What’s wrong with you? He laughs. Gotta keep you off balance, he says. Gotta set the tone.\n\nSo let’s do that. Here are some key things to know about R. Kelly. His first name is Robert, he’s 48 years old, and he’s inarguably the biggest male R&B singer since Marvin Gaye. Probably the most talented and sexually explicit, too. He grew up poor and functionally ­illiterateowing to dyslexiaon Chicago’s South Side, raised mostly by his mother. In his memoir, Soulacoaster: The Diary of Me, he wrote about being sexually abused as a child by a woman from the neighborhood. Around the same time, boarders in his family’s house repeatedly made him take photos of them having sex. When he was 8, he watched helplessly as his first love, Lulu, drowned after bullies pushed her into a creek. At 11, he was shot by thieves trying to steal his bike. The bullet is still in his shoulder.\n\nKelly was musical from as far back as he can remember, and he began his career on the streets, singing for money in his clear, gorgeous tenor. In 1991, he joined a New Jack Swing group, Public Announcement, and went solo soon after. His debut, 12 Play (as opposed, the logic goes, to a less capable lover’s foreplay), was released in 1993. Since then, Kelly has sold somewhere in the neighborhood of 34 million albums. He’s been nominated for 25 Grammy Awards and won three. In 2010, Billboard named Kelly the No. 1 R&B and hip-hop artist of the last quarter-­century. In addition to his own batch of 33 sinuous, perfectly arranged top-20 R&B hit singles, and another 17 that achieved the same designation on the pop Hot 100, Kelly has collaborated on smashes with Céline Dion and Michael Jackson. Pitchfork deemed his irresistible Ignition (Remix) the 19th-best track of the aughts. He was largely responsible for introducing Aaliyah, Drake’s emotional lodestar, to the world. Even Jim DeRogatis, the former Chicago Sun-Times reporter and pop critic, who has done more than anyone else to spread the word on Kelly’s alleged unlawful sexual behavior, admits: The man is a musical genius.\n\nThat’s the music. There’s also this: a long list of allegations that Kelly has used his money and power to have sex with minors. In 1994, when Kelly was 27 and Aaliyah was 15, the two were married under a falsified document that stated she was 18. The marriage was quickly annulled and Kelly, who produced Aaliyah’s debut albumcalled Age Ain’t Nothing But a Numberhasn’t said much about it since, out of, he says, respect for the late singer’s family. (Aaliyah had signed an agreement requiring her to stay silent about the brief marriage.) In 1996, Kelly was sued for damages by a woman alleging the two began a sexual relationship when she was 15. Kelly settled out of court. In 2001, a similar lawsuit with a similar result. The next year, he was indicted on 21 counts of making child pornography after police came into possession of a video depicting a man resembling Kelly having sex with a young woman. Also in 2002, another lawsuit, this one from a woman claiming both that Kelly impregnated her while she was underage and that one of his associates took her to get an abortion. Kelly settled. That same year, a woman sued Kelly for filming, without her knowledge, the two having sex. Kelly settled. It goes on: at least a half-dozen more lawsuits, followed by settlements, followed by nondisclosure agreements. (There are also reportedly a handful of instances in which Kelly has agreed to payments before lawsuits were even filed. Presumably these, too, involve NDAs.)",

        "text": "Kelly was so affronted by the line of questioning that he up and left the studio -- but not before he commented on Modarressy-Tehrani's appearance, wondered whether she knew what the word \"deposition\" meant and questioned her level of intelligence. The only silver lining was that we got to see Modarressy-Tehrani keep her calm while being berated for asking the questions that any reporter should. (Watch a selection of clips from the interview below.)\n\nR. Kelly got a bit miffed Monday afternoon when HuffPost Live host Caroline Modarressy-Tehrani questioned the artist about how the sexual assault allegations against him impact the way fans consume his music.\n\nIn the midst of Kelly's deflection and abject horror that a reporter would deign to be anything but \"positive\" about him and his career, Modarressy-Tehrani responded like a boss. When Kelly called her a \"beautiful woman,\" she reminded him, \"You don't have to comment on my appearance, sir.\" When he continuously cut her off, she told him, \"Now let me do my job for a second because I haven't been able to ask you a question for a moment,\" before pressing him on the topics he'd been dodging.\n\nAsking the tough questions -- even when they don't have clear or comfortable answers -- is exactly what reporters are tasked with doing.\n\nA little background: Kelly has been accused of sexual assault by dozens of young women -- many of them in the context of lawsuits, many of them minors. The story was first reported in December 2000 by Chicago Sun-Times reporters Jim DeRogatis and Abdon M. Pallasch. In the years since, as the Village Voice reported in 2013, DeRogatis has \"interview[ed] hundreds of people...including dozens of young women whose lives DeRogatis says were ruined by the singer.\"\n\nIn that same Village Voice interview, published just after Kelly's \"Black Panties\" album dropped, DeRogatis calls the lawsuits against Kelly \"stomach-churning.\" As he told the Village Voice's Jessica Hopper:\n\nI think in the history of rock 'n' roll, rock music, or pop culture people misbehaving and behaving badly sexually with young women, rare is the amount of evidence compiled against anyone apart from R. Kelly. Dozens of girls -- not one, not two, dozens -- with harrowing lawsuits. The videotapes -- and not just one videotape, numerous videotapes... You watch the video for which he was indicted and there is the disembodied look of the rape victim. He orders her to call him Daddy. He urinates in her mouth and instructs her at great length on how to position herself to receive his \"gift.\" It's a rape that you're watching. So we're not talking about rock star misbehavior, which men or women can do. We're talking about predatory behavior. Their lives were ruined.\n\nA note to famous people seeking media promotion: If you've been accused of assaulting multiple minors, be prepared to be questioned about it.\n\nAs Modarressy-Tehrani told Kelly after he repeatedly dodged her questions but offered his \"love,\" \"You don't need to give me any of your love, sir...I just wanted to ask the question.\"\n\nHead over to HuffPost Live to watch the full interview.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:",

        "text": "That's not how I'm doing this. First, if he isn't prepared to engage in some kind of serious discussion on the more difficult parts of his life, then I can't see how there can be a significant article about R. Kelly in 2016 that is worth printing. Second, it would make me feel spineless and undignified. I've read, listened to, and watched every other R. Kelly interview I could find, and too often what happens is that if interviewers mention anything at all, what they do is make a perfunctory little raid on the subject, touching it just to say they did. Why play around? He knows, at least to some degree, what's coming. He's a grown man, 48 years old. He's stood on a thousand stages and sat through a criminal trial. I know it's not going to be a comfortable conversation, but surely the most respectful way to have it is to get on and have it.\n\nSo, walking in here, that is my plan.\n\nThe ninety-ninth floor appears to be completely bare. In the huge rectangular room where we meet, there are only two places to sit. One is on some sofas over in the far corner. Kelly chooses the other option. And so we sit facing each other, at a small round table set in the middle of the large empty space on the lakeward side of the tower, glass on three sides of us. It looks like a surreal over-the-top set for an interrogation scene in an action movie. Before we begin, Kelly tries to prop up his phone on the table between us, to record the conversation—I am as well—but it keeps sliding and falling over. First of all, before anything else, I want to talk with him about his childhood, and in particular some tough aspects of it that seem central to whom he has become. For one thing, his inability to read.\n\n“Other kids could read, other kids could write, other kids could spell, they could do math,” he says. “I felt like an alien, I felt like an outcast. I felt like, ‘What is going to happen to me?’ My mother couldn't answer it. My stepfather wasn't really interested in it one way or another. And my brothers and sisters were so young at the time they wouldn't do nothing but tease me about it. I was the ‘dummy’: ‘How you gon’ do this? You can't even read!' ”\n\nHe says it's not like he didn't try, and he describes what would happen when he did: “I would always hear scrambled music, like an orchestra going off that didn't know what they was doing. It was so confusing. It was, like, violin's playing ‘I Believe I Can Fly,’ the bass is playing ‘When a Woman's Fed Up,’ the guitar's playing ‘Bump N' Grind,’ the piano's playing a gospel song. And then I would end up getting really sleepy and tired.”\n\nReading remains a struggle. “Since my daughter showed me voice texts on my phone, I've gotten a lot better,” he says. “I'm not a A student, I'm not even a B student, but I've gotten a lot better with the reading because of texts. And I can voice-text and say whatever I want to people. And then they text me back and I take my time and I can read through it.”\n\nR. Kelly Sings the Story of His Life, the Abridged Version\n\nEarly on, Kelly faced other challenges. He grew up without a father, gone before Kelly was born, and his mother wouldn't talk about him. “That's the one thing,” he says to me. “If I could change anything, I would definitely have had a father around. My father. I would definitely say it affected me deeply as a young man, coming up. Who doesn't want a father? Those are the beginnings, and those are what can dictate the roads you choose in life, and choosing them well. And it affected me.”\n\nKelly had a deep, close relationship with his mother, but he says even she never knew everything that was going on in her young son's turbulent life. He says that until he mentioned it in his 2012 memoir, Soulacoaster, he had never told anyone at all about the sexual abuse that he experienced. (Not even his ex-wife Andrea? “Absolutely not.”) It was something he “put so far in the back of my mind that I even forgot about it.” This wasn't the history he wanted for the person he was becoming: “As I got older, the more I just didn't want it to be in my past. The more I became successful.” He was determined that the R. Kelly the world would know—the one who would sell more than 30 million albums, have 36 Billboard Hot 100 hits, invent his own strange musical language, write hits for countless others, and conceive one of the weirdest syntheses of video and music of all time, Trapped in the Closet—would be someone else. “I didn't want that to be something that was in my luggage once I got to my success home, so to speak.”\n\nIn the book, he describes a number of premature sexual experiences, including an approach by a trusted family friend, a man, who he says tried to persuade Kelly to masturbate him for money, which Kelly says he rebuffed. “It was a crazy weird experience,” he tells me. “But not a full-blown experience, because it didn't go down. Contact sexual—no. A visual—absolutely. A visual from him showing me his penis and all that stuff.” But he describes in his memoir how the full-on sexual abuse that lasted for several years (it was oral sex the first time, though he tells me it soon became intercourse) started one day when Kelly fell asleep in front of the TV and was awoken from “a crazy dream about Three's Company” to find a woman playing with him:",

Or perhaps convincing a ragtag group of cartoons led by Michael Jordan to believe they can fly, if not educating you in the finer arts of jubilantly celebrating the freakin’ weekend. But now the infamous musician has taken on a brand new role, giving all of these Instagram It-Girls a run for their money as the newest star of Alexander Wang‘s Spring/Summer 2017 digital campaign alongside model and brand-favorite Anna Ewers.\n\nThe campaign for the designer’s latest collection was shot by famed photographers Inez and Vinoodh in the penthouse of the Old Police Building in downtown Manhattan. According to a press release for the campaign aptly titled, “Beyond Reality,” the images are meant to “blur the lines between fantasy and reality, presenting a unique observation on the superficial with a though-provoking commentary on society’s current obsessions with speculation: did that happen, did it not? What was real and what was fabricated?”\n\nRELATED: Meet R. Kelly’s Secret Soulmate: Stanley Kubrick?\n\nThe photos themselves feature R. Kelly wearing an all-black suit with no tie, a striped scarf, and his signature shades all while smoking a cigar and lounging side-by-side with Ewers who wears a big, white fur coat and crystal-covered bucket bag while smoking a cigarette.\n\nThe photos were taken during a giant party Wang held in the building on December 7 in collaboration with Beats by Dr. Dre to celebrate the launch of his second headphone collaboration.\n\nIn the end, we can’t decide what we’re more excited about, R. Kelly’s promising new career as a burgeoning supermodel, or the additional 4o chapters of his seminal hip-hopera “Trapped in the Closet” that he has assured the public are forthcoming. Only time will tell.\n\nWhat do you think of R. Kelly joining the #WANGSQUAD? Who would you like to see become a member next? Sound off below!",

        "text": "R. Kelly never really went away, but in 2013 he has crept back into pop culture nonetheless. He spent the summer headlining large summer festivals, basking in the glow of fans singing his discography back to him. He managed to—if even for a moment—usurp Daft Punk at Coachella during the encore of Phoenix’s closing set, belting out the opening notes of “Bump N’ Grind” to a dead silent crowd waiting for a curtain to drop and reveal a giant pyramid. He would then appear on the remix of the Frenchies’ “Trying To Be Cool” and later on tracks by Justin Bieber (“PYD”) and Lady Gaga. The latter collaboration—the deliciously slinky “Do What U Want”—was a runaway hit that led to appearances on SNL and the American Music Awards, both of which were easily Kelly’s most high-profile television looks in half a decade.\n\nIt has been a fun year for the 46-year-old, an unexpected and smooth resurgence at a time when it looked like he was content to rest in the soft embrace of R&B radio and sold out 5,000 capacity theaters. The nightcap is his 13th solo album Black Panties, which tosses aside the classic soul of his previous two albums (2010’s Love Letter and last year’s Write Me Back) for a deep dive into the sounds of contemporary bumping and grinding. For much of the past 10 years, Kelly’s career has been defined by trying to balance his traditionalist roots with a desire to continually update his sound. He has more or less been able to maintain that balance, like on TP3 Reloaded or Double Up, two albums that feature a number of regrettable collaborations (The Game? Kid Rock??) but also a handful of his most indelible tracks. But we also saw the singer reek of desperation on 2009’s Untitled, a drab and misguided album slathered in AutoTune that is inarguably the low point of his career.\n\nBlack Panties establishes a third position. There is no “I’m a Flirt (Remix)” or “Same Girl” or “Trapped in the Closet” here, standout singles that rejigger his entire career. There are also few if any profoundly novel album cuts—be it anything as truly outlandish as “The Zoo” or effortlessly tuneful as “Kickin’ It With Your Girlfriend” or “Freaky in the Club”—that quietly register as some of his best work. Instead, Black Panties is thematically coherent and consistently listenable, not unlike Love Letter in that sense, though of course different in just about every other.\n\nThe album is almost exclusively about pussy—which, duh, R. Kelly. No one has sung as prolifically about pussy as the man whose debut album sports a nearly seven minute long song called “I Like the Crotch On You\", and perhaps no one will in our lifetimes. On the one hand, Kells reinforces his identity here: for him, comparing pussy to a cookie (on, well, “Cookie”) is not a one-bar metaphor. It is instead an entire song in which he sings about “lick[ing] the middle like an Oreo.” This is the power of R. Kelly: it will be impossible to eat an Oreo for a while without thinking of cunnilingus. He has fundamentally altered your existence.\n\nThere is also something undeniably great about a song like “Marry the Pussy,” in which Kelly gives the song’s subject an entire persona: “Pussy talk to me/Pussy sing to me/ Yeah, so much joy it bring to me.” With a song like this, Kelly allows himself to be more human than the rest of us. It is not ridiculous that he wants to marry a pussy—that level of carnality exists somewhere in all of us, male or female. His brilliance is in routinely bringing out into the open the things that—with good reason!—stay in the darkest corners of our minds. In disrupting the social order, maybe his music helps preserve it as well.\n\nBut, in the context of his own discography at least, Black Panties isn’t as gleefully absurd as we’ve come to expect from him. It’s not exactly that every R. Kelly song needs to construct an entire fable (TP3’s “Sex Weed” is a good example of him losing the plot), but that at its best his dirtiest tracks have the frission of the legitimately unexpected—each song has the potential to be its own developed story, or to shock the public anew. With Black Panties, what you see is mostly what you get.\n\nWhat we get is a pretty good modern R&B album, but it’s also one that feels just a bit fossilized. With its undulating synths, abundance of screwed vocals and slowly churning tempos, Black Panties sounds suspiciously like the-Dream’s first two albums. Tracks like “Throw This Money On You” (which is still pretty great) and “Genius” (which is not) sound ripped almost wholesale from the album in which the-Dream wrote a song called “Kelly’s 12 Play\", where he obsessively details fucking to Kelly’s debut album. At times, listening to Black Panties can be like watching the snake eat its own tail. There are also a number of tracks in which Kelly collaborates with current stars like Migos (“Show Ya Pussy”) or DJ Mustard (“Spend That”), and though none come off anywhere nearly as poorly as his song with OJ Da Juiceman, there is also an instant loss of individuality that renders them a bit useless.\n\nBlack Panties concludes with “Shut Up,” in which he condemns critics, haters and ex-friends who declared his career dead. Considering his numerous past transgressions with minors, the song (which is actually about his vocal surgery) is rather tone-deaf, though that is not exactly a new development either. But it does end the album on a defiant note that is as jarring as it is energizing. The Pied Piper of R&B finds himself head over heels in love with pussy, yet he refuses to settle down. Or maybe, that is precisely why he won't.",

And while Tyga sported a “Secret Location” Alexander Wang sweatshirt, there was nothing secret about their upcoming participation in Wang’s fall campaign. The couple will join the likes of Skrillex and Calvin Harris’s once-rumored girlfriend Tinashe as part of the Wang Squad.\n\nBefore the show, Kylie posted an Instagram of the designer putting some finishing touches on her plunging, pleated silver mini dress. And with all the intricate cut-outs and silver and black detailing, the reality star needed two people to finalize her look. “Pre-Show fittings with Alex,” she wrote.\n\nTyga matched the silver and black theme but kept his look athleisure-inspired with a backwards baseball cap, silver jewelry and black sweatpants.\n\nImage zoom Antonio de Moraes Barros Filho/FilmMagic Antonio de Moraes Barros Filho/FilmMagic\n\nMeanwhile, Kendall looked like she was ready for a day at the beach in a black bikini top, mermaid-like wrap skirt and flip flops. Her hair was styled with beachy waves and she had barely-there makeup on. The look was tied together with a black leather and jewel-encrusted bag that was chained to her wrist.\n\nImage zoom\n\nImage zoom Splash News Online Splash News Online\n\nAnd seated just next to Tyga (and a few away from Madonna!), Nicki Minaj flaunted her figure in an ankle-length black bodycon dress. The rapper, 33, kept it simple with sleek straightened hair and nude pumps.\n\nKylie and Tyga have become fixtures during New York Fashion Week, first getting things started at Kanye West’s Yeezy Season 4 show last week.\n\nOn Friday night, Harper’s BAZAAR‘s celebration of the third ICONS portfolio by Carine Roitfeld, Kylie told PEOPLE she was “so proud” of Tyga after West revealed that he had signed the rapper to his G.O.O.D.

But team KenGi or team Seymour, no matter where you find yourself one thing is undeniable — there’s a whole new crop of It girls in fashion and whether you call them super or not, they’re not going anywhere anytime soon. So to help you unpack all the faces you’re going to need to know for this coming fashion month and beyond, we’ve compiled a list of the top five major models and their bodies of work thus far so you can be an expert on all things runway just in time for NYFW.\n\nTo quantify just how major these models already are, we’ve broken down all of their most crucial stats from 2016, including social media followers, magazine covers, and runways walked so far this year, to see how the biggest faces in the biz stack up and why it’s more important than ever to know them right now.\n\nKendall Jenner\n\nAge: 20\n\nInstagram Followers: 64.9 million\n\nCovers: 8\n\nRunways: 15\n\nWhy You Need to Know Her Right Now: When Vogue gives a model the coveted September issue cover slot, the industry tends to sit up and take notice. Plus, with the biggest family in reality TV backing her up, it’s hare to imagine this model’s career is going anywhere but up.\n\nGigi Hadid\n\nAge: 21\n\nInstagram Followers: 22.4 million\n\nCovers: 10\n\nRunways: 11\n\nWhy You Need to Know Her Right Now: After booking almost every major catwalk and covers of fashion magazines the world over, Gigi has now transcended the role of muse, becoming a brand collaborator and co-designer, launching her first collection with Tommy Hilfiger this month at NYFW. And after achieving her goal of walking the Victoria’s Secret runway, it seems this top model is going to have to set her sights a little higher.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: ’90s Supermodels: Just As Gorgeous Then As They Are Now\n\nBella Hadid\n\nAge: 19\n\nInstagram Followers: 6.1 million\n\nCovers: 22\n\nRunways: 11\n\nWhy You Need to Know Her Right Now: While Gigi may have garnered all the initial modeling buzz, Bella has been the slow burn breakout success of 2016. Month by month the model’s career seems to be building momentum, booking five big magazine covers in September alone. And with her high profile romance with The Weeknd still going strong, it seems this model’s star will only continue to rise.\n\nTaylor Hill\n\nAge: 20\n\nInstagram Followers: 4.6 million\n\nCovers: 6\n\nRunways: 25\n\nWhy You Need to Know Her Right Now: Taylor has been on a serious roll lately, booking one big magazine and runway show after the next. Plus, with a contract with Victoria’s Secret and a new deal as the face of Lancôme, this model is on the fast track towards household name status.\n\nHailey Baldwin\n\nAge: 19\n\nInstagram Followers: 7.3 million\n\nCovers: 2\n\nRunways: 2\n\nWhy You Need to Know Her Now: Hailey may not be racking up numbers quite as big as those of her contemporary catwalkers, but over the past year her career has been steadily building, with 2017 poised to be her most successful to date. Being BFFs with the reigning queens of fashion, KenGi, certainly doesn’t hurt either.",

        "text": "Image zoom JEN LOWERY/LFI\n\nEXPOSED: New York Yankees slugger Gary Sheffield revealed Tuesday that someone posing as a minister attempted to blackmail him for at least $20,000 with alleged sex tapes of the athlete’s wife with another woman and R. Kelly, reports New York’s Daily News and the New York Post. The alleged tape was purported to have been made more than 10 years ago. In a statement, Sheffield said that he knew his wife, a child gospel star, had had a relationship with Kelly before their marriage, and does not care to see the tape. “I will not be blackmailed (and) have my family dragged through the mud,” he said. The FBI reportedly has suspect Derrick Mosley, of Chicago, in custody. His lawyer would not comment. Kelly (who has pleaded not guilty in a current child porn case) denies knowing anything about this alleged tape, his rep tells the Post.\n\nREQUESTED: Filmmaker Roman Polanski has asked England’s highest court to allow him to sue Vanity Fair magazine for libel via video link so he can avoid the risk of being extradited to the United States, Reuters reports. The director of The Pianist fled the U.S. in 1977 after admitting to having sexual relations with a minor. Polanski, 71, lives in Paris and says the magazine defamed him by accusing him of seducing a woman who was with another man. The Oscar-winning director wants to use the English courts for the suit, but is scared if he goes to Britain he’ll be extradited to the U.S. as a “fugitive from justice.” The law lords are expected to give a decision in writing by early next year.\n\nDELIVERED: Actress Laurel Holloman, 36, the star of Showtime’s The L Word, and her husband, production designer Paul Macherey, 36, welcomed daughter Lola on Nov. 4 in Vancouver, B.C., PEOPLE reports in its latest issue. It’s their first child.\n\nCLAIMED: Liza Minnelli, 58, says her former bodyguard, who claims she forced him to have sex with her to keep his job, and her estranged husband David Gest have joined forces to attack and embarrass her publicly, according to Manhattan State Supreme Court papers filed on Nov. 9 and just posted on the “Celebrity Justice” Web site. The documents also say M’Hammed Soumayah, 56, breached a confidentiality agreement by giving Gest, 52, personal information about Minnelli. The papers note that soon after Soumayah filed his $100 million lawsuit against Minnelli, Gest issued a press release supporting the bodyguard’s charges. Gest has filed his own $10 million lawsuit against Minnelli.\n\nREVIVED: Jennifer Love Hewitt, 25, is being given another chance, as ABC is bringing back her comedy project that the network originally developed last season, says the Hollywood Reporter. The untitled project, which has been given a green light for six episodes, stars Hewitt as a sports producer who unwillingly becomes an on-camera reporter on a sports TV show. Ed O’Neill (Married … With Children) costars.\n\nRELAPSED: Law & Order: Criminal Intent star Vincent D’Onofrio, 46, was back in a hospital Tuesday after fainting for the second time in a week, the Associated Press reports. D’Onofrio was hospitalized for two days last week when he fainted after rehearsing a strenuous scene that included climbing for the New York-based NBC drama. He had been expected to return to work Tuesday. But he fainted again late Monday at his New York home and returned to the hospital for further observation and testing, said a series spokeswoman, adding: “He’s in good spirits and producers are optimistic he’ll be released soon.”\n\nARRESTED: Lionel Richie’s estranged wife, Diane Richie, has been arrested in Beverly Hills for allegedly allowing her boyfriend, Daniel Tomas Fuente Serrano, to convert her bathroom into an illegal cosmetic surgery clinic offering anti-wrinkle treatments, officials said. She reportedly spent a night in jail but was released on $25,000 late Tuesday.\n\nSUED: Alabama writer Glynn Wilson is suing biographer Kitty Kelley, claiming the best-selling author plagiarized his work in her The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty. “I’m trying to make a living down here as a freelance writer and these New York writers rip you off,” Glynn Wilson tells the Birmingham News. The lawsuit was filed last month in Birmingham federal court against Kelley and publisher Random House Inc. Katherine J. Trager, general counsel for Random House, told The New York Times that the lawsuit was “meritless” and that the company was “confident that we will obtain its dismissal.”",

        "text": "Image zoom Frazer Harrison/AMA2013/FilmMagic; Columbia Pictures/Getty\n\nR. Kelly’s album, Black Panties, dropped on Tuesday, but the singer has been planning its release since a certain undergarment landed on his wrist during a 2011 show.\n\nCall us crazy, but Kelly’s pursuit of panty greatness calls to mind another talented man: the late Stanley Kubrick. (Yes, film theorists, you read that right.) While it may be hard to picture the mastermind behind The Shining and the singer of “Bump ‘n Grind” having a meaningful conversation, this odd couple has more in common than meets the eye.\n\nKelly: It’s easy to shrug off the mastery of R. Kelly’s music due to song titles like “Feelin’ On Yo Booty,” but the singer likes to be specific. Why else would he have 33 chapters of “Trapped in the Closet?”\n\nKubrick: The Eyes Wide Shut director, who passed away in 1999, was known for demanding perfection. Actors who worked with Kubrick noted it was common for him to do dozens of retakes until a shot was just right. Imagine what his artistic eye could’ve added to “Ignition (Remix).”\n\nKelly: The crooner’s hit claims “I Believe I Can Fly” but R. Kelly secretly has his doubts. The performer has a fear of flying, and he prefers to travel by bus.\n\nKubrick: Born in New York, Kubrick eventually moved to England because of the country’s looser censorship guidelines. As a dedicated homebody, the director avoided flying. Far before the days of Netflix, he would have VHS copies of The Simpsons and Seinfeld shipped to him.\n\nKelly: R. Kelly briefly exchanged songs for sneakers, signing with the Atlantic City Seagulls basketball team in the midst of his musical career – which begs the question, why didn’t Space Jam put R. Kelly on the soundtrack and in the movie?\n\nKubrick: Like many stubborn teens, a 13 year old Stanley Kubrick was certain he wanted to be a jazz drummer one day. This dream quickly evaporated when Kubrick’s dad gave him a camera, leading to Kubrick’s lifelong love for photography and film.\n\nKelly: Black Panties reveals that R. Kelly is a self-proclaimed sex genius, but that isn’t his only area of expertise. Outside the sheets, R. Kelly had more top 40 hits than any other male solo artist in the 1990s.\n\nKubrick: Surprisingly, many of Kubrick’s films were initially panned by critics. However, Kubrick is now considered one of film’s quintessential directors. He is heralded be fellow moviemakers for his willingness to take inspiring risks with filming styles, special effects and musical scoring.\n\nKelly: The R&B star wrote, produced and mixed the majority of his albums. This level of control allows Kelly to steer his musical style any way he sees fit, including an album built around a pair of underwear.\n\nKubrick: The director served as the writer, producer and director on most of his projects, shepherding his films through every stage of creation. he also assisted with cinematography, camera operation and editing.\n\nImage zoom R. Kelly and Jay Z, 2002 Scott Gries/ImageDirect/Getty\n\nKelly: R. Kelly and Jay Z‘s Best of Both Worlds tour ended up being the worst for everyone involved. The duo had continuous issues with one another on the road, allegedly feuding over Kelly’s legal troubles, ego problems and more, culminating in the tour’s cancellation.\n\nImage zoom Marlon Brando in 1961's One-Eyed Jacks and Stanley Kubrick in 1975 John Kobal Foundation/Getty; Silver Screen Collection/Getty\n\nKubrick: Early in the director’s career, Kubrick was assigned to head One-Eyed Jacks, a movie starring Marlon Brando. Brando and Kubrick continually clashed over changes to the film. Eventually, Brando had the director fired and took over the project himself.\n\nLike us on Facebook for more stories like this!\n\nLike us on Facebook for more stories like this!",

        "text": "Image zoom Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe much-discussed Space Jam 2 now has a director (Justin Lin) to go along with its star (LeBron James), and fans of the original (well, me, anyway) have just one question:\n\nHow will the sequel’s soundtrack ever live up to the original?\n\nYou know, the Space Jam soundtrack. The one that gave the world “I Believe I Can Fly” and eventually went platinum six times over? That soundtrack.\n\nReleased on Nov. 12, 1996, below please find a celebration of the singular piece of art that is the Space Jam soundtrack.\n\n\"Fly Like an Eagle\"\n\nIn 1996, Seal had just won three Grammys for “Kiss From a Rose,” which had been re-released as part of the Batman Forever soundtrack in 1995. Getting him on the Space Jam soundtrack must have seemed like a slam-dunk (pun fully intended), but it was his manager, Dominique Trenier’s idea to cover the Steve Miller song “Fly Like an Eagle.” D’Angelo, also managed by Trenier at the time, plays keys on the track, and Seal said he once got a call from Steve Miller thanking him and calling Seal’s version the best cover of the song he’d heard.\n\n\"The Winner\"\n\nSimilarly, Coolio was riding a wave of success from having the Grammy-winning “Gangsta’s Paradise” included on the Dangerous Minds soundtrack in 1995, so having him record another “message” song for the Space Jam soundtrack probably seemed like a great idea at the time. Even though a video for the song, which features a sample of Curtis Mayfield’s “Movin’ On Up,” was produced, it sadly wasn’t released as a single.\n\n\"I Believe I Can Fly\"\n\n“I Believe I Can Fly” is practically deserving of its own oral history. Apparently Kelly and Michael Jordan, attended the same athletic club in Chicago, and Jordan personally asked the singer to record a song for his upcoming movie. Kelly agreed without knowing anything else about the project, but he attended a screening and came up with the idea for the song. In his memoir Soulacoaster, he recounts waking up in the middle of the night at a hotel and going down to the lobby to work on “I Believe I Can Fly.” After about two hours of fiddling with the chords and melody, in walked Notorious B.I.G.: Kelly played him the song’s hook, which reportedly moved the rapper to tears. Kelly would later win three Grammys for the song, which he produced himself.\n\n\"Hit ‘Em High\"\n\nPutting aside the cognitive dissonance of having rappers like Method Man (whose signature Wu Tang song opens with the series of inventive tortures he’s going to inflict on you) and B-Real (from Cypress Hill, best known for their hit “How Could I Just Kill a Man” and prodigious references to marijuana) on a soundtrack for a family film, “Hit ‘Em High” is fascinating because it was produced by Trackmasters, a hip-hop production team who collectively have seven gold and 20 platinum records to their names. The group has not only produced such “serious” hip-hop as B.I.G’s “Juicy” and Foxy Brown’s “Ill Na Na” but also Will Smith’s “Miami” and “Men in Black.” And the song features LL Cool J rapping the line, “If the refs get political, dribble like Bob Dole.” So there’s that.\n\n\"For You I Will\"\n\nMonica’s “For You I Will” was written by songwriting genius Diane Warren, who, among other honors, is the first songwriter in the history of Billboard to have seven hits, all by different artists, on the singles chart simultaneously. Warren also contributed\n\n\"I Turn to You\"\n\n“I Turn to You,” sung here by All-4-One. However, the song would receive a second life two years later when Christina Aguilera would re-record it for her self-titled debut album. Released as the third single from the album, Aguilera’s version of “I Turn to You” would eventually peak at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and become an international hit.\n\n\"Basketball Jones\"\n\n“Basketball Jones” has a weird history: The original was recorded by comedy duo Cheech & Chong in 1973 as a parody of the hit “Love Jones” by Brighter Side of Darkness. It reached one chart spot higher (no. 15 on the Hot 100) than the original, becoming the only parody song to reach higher than its source material. Cheech & Chong’s version was recorded with an absolutely insane backing band: George Harrison, Klaus Voorman (a Beatles friend who played bass on both Harrison and Lennon’s solo records), legendary rock and roll session drummer Jim Keltner, similarly legendary session pianist Nicky Hopkins (who played on records by the Kinks and Rolling Stones, at one point turning down an offer to join the latter group full-time), Billy Preston (who, you know, spent some time with the Beatles), and oh yeah, Carole King. Basically, it was a coincidence that this absurdly talented group coalesced to record a stoner comedy record – Cheech & Chong were recording in the A&M Studios, where all the aforementioned players were working on various projects, and people just sort of trickled in to contribute.\n\n\"Buggin’\"\n\nThis song is notable because it was written by Jay Z, who had, in 1996, just released Reasonable Doubt, an absolute monster of a debut album that is mostly about dealing drugs and growing up in the projects in Brooklyn. And, there is an unverified rumor circulating that out there somewhere, there exists a demo of Jay Z rapping this song as Bugs Bunny. Let that sink in for a minute. (Incidentally, Bugs Bunny is voiced on the soundtrack and in the film by Billy West, the voice of Fry from Futurama, the red M&M and about a dozen other animated characters from the past thirty-some-odd years.)\n\n\"Space Jam Theme Song\"\n\nQuad City DJ’s are C.C. Lemonhead (Nathaniel Orange) and Jay Ski (Johnny McGowan). They are responsible for not just the Space Jam theme, but also 1996’s inescapable “C’mon N’ Ride It (The Train),” which likely landed them the Space Jam gig. They also produced the 69 Boyz’s double-platinum single “Tootsee Roll” and are known for dragging the regional club-based “Miami bass” sound into the spotlight in the 1990s.",

        "text": "R. Kelly never really went away, but in 2013 he has crept back into pop culture nonetheless. He spent the summer headlining large summer festivals, basking in the glow of fans singing his discography back to him. He managed to—if even for a moment—usurp Daft Punk at Coachella during the encore of Phoenix’s closing set, belting out the opening notes of “Bump N’ Grind” to a dead silent crowd waiting for a curtain to drop and reveal a giant pyramid. He would then appear on the remix of the Frenchies’ “Trying To Be Cool” and later on tracks by Justin Bieber (“PYD”) and Lady Gaga. The latter collaboration—the deliciously slinky “Do What U Want”—was a runaway hit that led to appearances on SNL and the American Music Awards, both of which were easily Kelly’s most high-profile television looks in half a decade.\n\nIt has been a fun year for the 46-year-old, an unexpected and smooth resurgence at a time when it looked like he was content to rest in the soft embrace of R&B radio and sold out 5,000 capacity theaters. The nightcap is his 13th solo album Black Panties, which tosses aside the classic soul of his previous two albums (2010’s Love Letter and last year’s Write Me Back) for a deep dive into the sounds of contemporary bumping and grinding. For much of the past 10 years, Kelly’s career has been defined by trying to balance his traditionalist roots with a desire to continually update his sound. He has more or less been able to maintain that balance, like on TP3 Reloaded or Double Up, two albums that feature a number of regrettable collaborations (The Game? Kid Rock??) but also a handful of his most indelible tracks. But we also saw the singer reek of desperation on 2009’s Untitled, a drab and misguided album slathered in AutoTune that is inarguably the low point of his career.\n\nBlack Panties establishes a third position. There is no “I’m a Flirt (Remix)” or “Same Girl” or “Trapped in the Closet” here, standout singles that rejigger his entire career. There are also few if any profoundly novel album cuts—be it anything as truly outlandish as “The Zoo” or effortlessly tuneful as “Kickin’ It With Your Girlfriend” or “Freaky in the Club”—that quietly register as some of his best work. Instead, Black Panties is thematically coherent and consistently listenable, not unlike Love Letter in that sense, though of course different in just about every other.\n\nThe album is almost exclusively about pussy—which, duh, R. Kelly. No one has sung as prolifically about pussy as the man whose debut album sports a nearly seven minute long song called “I Like the Crotch On You\", and perhaps no one will in our lifetimes. On the one hand, Kells reinforces his identity here: for him, comparing pussy to a cookie (on, well, “Cookie”) is not a one-bar metaphor. It is instead an entire song in which he sings about “lick[ing] the middle like an Oreo.” This is the power of R. Kelly: it will be impossible to eat an Oreo for a while without thinking of cunnilingus. He has fundamentally altered your existence.\n\nThere is also something undeniably great about a song like “Marry the Pussy,” in which Kelly gives the song’s subject an entire persona: “Pussy talk to me/Pussy sing to me/ Yeah, so much joy it bring to me.” With a song like this, Kelly allows himself to be more human than the rest of us. It is not ridiculous that he wants to marry a pussy—that level of carnality exists somewhere in all of us, male or female. His brilliance is in routinely bringing out into the open the things that—with good reason!—stay in the darkest corners of our minds. In disrupting the social order, maybe his music helps preserve it as well.\n\nBut, in the context of his own discography at least, Black Panties isn’t as gleefully absurd as we’ve come to expect from him. It’s not exactly that every R. Kelly song needs to construct an entire fable (TP3’s “Sex Weed” is a good example of him losing the plot), but that at its best his dirtiest tracks have the frission of the legitimately unexpected—each song has the potential to be its own developed story, or to shock the public anew. With Black Panties, what you see is mostly what you get.\n\nWhat we get is a pretty good modern R&B album, but it’s also one that feels just a bit fossilized. With its undulating synths, abundance of screwed vocals and slowly churning tempos, Black Panties sounds suspiciously like the-Dream’s first two albums. Tracks like “Throw This Money On You” (which is still pretty great) and “Genius” (which is not) sound ripped almost wholesale from the album in which the-Dream wrote a song called “Kelly’s 12 Play\", where he obsessively details fucking to Kelly’s debut album. At times, listening to Black Panties can be like watching the snake eat its own tail. There are also a number of tracks in which Kelly collaborates with current stars like Migos (“Show Ya Pussy”) or DJ Mustard (“Spend That”), and though none come off anywhere nearly as poorly as his song with OJ Da Juiceman, there is also an instant loss of individuality that renders them a bit useless.\n\nBlack Panties concludes with “Shut Up,” in which he condemns critics, haters and ex-friends who declared his career dead. Considering his numerous past transgressions with minors, the song (which is actually about his vocal surgery) is rather tone-deaf, though that is not exactly a new development either. But it does end the album on a defiant note that is as jarring as it is energizing. The Pied Piper of R&B finds himself head over heels in love with pussy, yet he refuses to settle down. Or maybe, that is precisely why he won't.",

The couple will join the likes of Skrillex and Calvin Harris’s once-rumored girlfriend Tinashe as part of the Wang Squad.\n\nBefore the show, Kylie posted an Instagram of the designer putting some finishing touches on her plunging, pleated silver mini dress. And with all the intricate cut-outs and silver and black detailing, the reality star needed two people to finalize her look. “Pre-Show fittings with Alex,” she wrote.\n\nTyga matched the silver and black theme but kept his look athleisure-inspired with a backwards baseball cap, silver jewelry and black sweatpants.\n\nImage zoom Antonio de Moraes Barros Filho/FilmMagic Antonio de Moraes Barros Filho/FilmMagic\n\nMeanwhile, Kendall looked like she was ready for a day at the beach in a black bikini top, mermaid-like wrap skirt and flip flops. Her hair was styled with beachy waves and she had barely-there makeup on. The look was tied together with a black leather and jewel-encrusted bag that was chained to her wrist.\n\nImage zoom\n\nImage zoom Splash News Online Splash News Online\n\nAnd seated just next to Tyga (and a few away from Madonna!), Nicki Minaj flaunted her figure in an ankle-length black bodycon dress. The rapper, 33, kept it simple with sleek straightened hair and nude pumps.\n\nKylie and Tyga have become fixtures during New York Fashion Week, first getting things started at Kanye West’s Yeezy Season 4 show last week.\n\nOn Friday night, Harper’s BAZAAR‘s celebration of the third ICONS portfolio by Carine Roitfeld, Kylie told PEOPLE she was “so proud” of Tyga after West revealed that he had signed the rapper to his G.O.O.D. Label.\n\nWhat do you think of these Alexander Wang looks? Let us know below!\n\n–With reporting by Jeffrey Slonim",

        "text": "Image zoom Source: Gigi Hadid/Instagram\n\nYou may think that the presidential campaigns have been one increasingly heated argument after the next, but Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have nothing on the debates that have been raging in 2016 throughout the fashion industry over the hotly disputed term supermodel. But team KenGi or team Seymour, no matter where you find yourself one thing is undeniable — there’s a whole new crop of It girls in fashion and whether you call them super or not, they’re not going anywhere anytime soon. So to help you unpack all the faces you’re going to need to know for this coming fashion month and beyond, we’ve compiled a list of the top five major models and their bodies of work thus far so you can be an expert on all things runway just in time for NYFW.\n\nTo quantify just how major these models already are, we’ve broken down all of their most crucial stats from 2016, including social media followers, magazine covers, and runways walked so far this year, to see how the biggest faces in the biz stack up and why it’s more important than ever to know them right now.\n\nKendall Jenner\n\nAge: 20\n\nInstagram Followers: 64.9 million\n\nCovers: 8\n\nRunways: 15\n\nWhy You Need to Know Her Right Now: When Vogue gives a model the coveted September issue cover slot, the industry tends to sit up and take notice. Plus, with the biggest family in reality TV backing her up, it’s hare to imagine this model’s career is going anywhere but up.\n\nGigi Hadid\n\nAge: 21\n\nInstagram Followers: 22.4 million\n\nCovers: 10\n\nRunways: 11\n\nWhy You Need to Know Her Right Now: After booking almost every major catwalk and covers of fashion magazines the world over, Gigi has now transcended the role of muse, becoming a brand collaborator and co-designer, launching her first collection with Tommy Hilfiger this month at NYFW. And after achieving her goal of walking the Victoria’s Secret runway, it seems this top model is going to have to set her sights a little higher.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: ’90s Supermodels: Just As Gorgeous Then As They Are Now\n\nBella Hadid\n\nAge: 19\n\nInstagram Followers: 6.1 million\n\nCovers: 22\n\nRunways: 11\n\nWhy You Need to Know Her Right Now: While Gigi may have garnered all the initial modeling buzz, Bella has been the slow burn breakout success of 2016. Month by month the model’s career seems to be building momentum, booking five big magazine covers in September alone. And with her high profile romance with The Weeknd still going strong, it seems this model’s star will only continue to rise.\n\nTaylor Hill\n\nAge: 20\n\nInstagram Followers: 4.6 million\n\nCovers: 6\n\nRunways: 25\n\nWhy You Need to Know Her Right Now: Taylor has been on a serious roll lately, booking one big magazine and runway show after the next. Plus, with a contract with Victoria’s Secret and a new deal as the face of Lancôme, this model is on the fast track towards household name status.\n\nHailey Baldwin\n\nAge: 19\n\nInstagram Followers: 7.3 million\n\nCovers: 2\n\nRunways: 2\n\nWhy You Need to Know Her Now: Hailey may not be racking up numbers quite as big as those of her contemporary catwalkers, but over the past year her career has been steadily building, with 2017 poised to be her most successful to date. Being BFFs with the reigning queens of fashion, KenGi, certainly doesn’t hurt either.",

        "text": "Image zoom JEN LOWERY/LFI\n\nEXPOSED: New York Yankees slugger Gary Sheffield revealed Tuesday that someone posing as a minister attempted to blackmail him for at least $20,000 with alleged sex tapes of the athlete’s wife with another woman and R. Kelly, reports New York’s Daily News and the New York Post. The alleged tape was purported to have been made more than 10 years ago. In a statement, Sheffield said that he knew his wife, a child gospel star, had had a relationship with Kelly before their marriage, and does not care to see the tape. “I will not be blackmailed (and) have my family dragged through the mud,” he said. The FBI reportedly has suspect Derrick Mosley, of Chicago, in custody. His lawyer would not comment. Kelly (who has pleaded not guilty in a current child porn case) denies knowing anything about this alleged tape, his rep tells the Post.\n\nREQUESTED: Filmmaker Roman Polanski has asked England’s highest court to allow him to sue Vanity Fair magazine for libel via video link so he can avoid the risk of being extradited to the United States, Reuters reports. The director of The Pianist fled the U.S. in 1977 after admitting to having sexual relations with a minor. Polanski, 71, lives in Paris and says the magazine defamed him by accusing him of seducing a woman who was with another man. The Oscar-winning director wants to use the English courts for the suit, but is scared if he goes to Britain he’ll be extradited to the U.S. as a “fugitive from justice.” The law lords are expected to give a decision in writing by early next year.\n\nDELIVERED: Actress Laurel Holloman, 36, the star of Showtime’s The L Word, and her husband, production designer Paul Macherey, 36, welcomed daughter Lola on Nov. 4 in Vancouver, B.C., PEOPLE reports in its latest issue. It’s their first child.\n\nCLAIMED: Liza Minnelli, 58, says her former bodyguard, who claims she forced him to have sex with her to keep his job, and her estranged husband David Gest have joined forces to attack and embarrass her publicly, according to Manhattan State Supreme Court papers filed on Nov. 9 and just posted on the “Celebrity Justice” Web site. The documents also say M’Hammed Soumayah, 56, breached a confidentiality agreement by giving Gest, 52, personal information about Minnelli. The papers note that soon after Soumayah filed his $100 million lawsuit against Minnelli, Gest issued a press release supporting the bodyguard’s charges. Gest has filed his own $10 million lawsuit against Minnelli.\n\nREVIVED: Jennifer Love Hewitt, 25, is being given another chance, as ABC is bringing back her comedy project that the network originally developed last season, says the Hollywood Reporter. The untitled project, which has been given a green light for six episodes, stars Hewitt as a sports producer who unwillingly becomes an on-camera reporter on a sports TV show. Ed O’Neill (Married … With Children) costars.\n\nRELAPSED: Law & Order: Criminal Intent star Vincent D’Onofrio, 46, was back in a hospital Tuesday after fainting for the second time in a week, the Associated Press reports. D’Onofrio was hospitalized for two days last week when he fainted after rehearsing a strenuous scene that included climbing for the New York-based NBC drama. He had been expected to return to work Tuesday. But he fainted again late Monday at his New York home and returned to the hospital for further observation and testing, said a series spokeswoman, adding: “He’s in good spirits and producers are optimistic he’ll be released soon.”\n\nARRESTED: Lionel Richie’s estranged wife, Diane Richie, has been arrested in Beverly Hills for allegedly allowing her boyfriend, Daniel Tomas Fuente Serrano, to convert her bathroom into an illegal cosmetic surgery clinic offering anti-wrinkle treatments, officials said. She reportedly spent a night in jail but was released on $25,000 late Tuesday.\n\nSUED: Alabama writer Glynn Wilson is suing biographer Kitty Kelley, claiming the best-selling author plagiarized his work in her The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty. “I’m trying to make a living down here as a freelance writer and these New York writers rip you off,” Glynn Wilson tells the Birmingham News. The lawsuit was filed last month in Birmingham federal court against Kelley and publisher Random House Inc. Katherine J. Trager, general counsel for Random House, told The New York Times that the lawsuit was “meritless” and that the company was “confident that we will obtain its dismissal.”",

        "text": "Image zoom Frazer Harrison/AMA2013/FilmMagic; Columbia Pictures/Getty\n\nR. Kelly’s album, Black Panties, dropped on Tuesday, but the singer has been planning its release since a certain undergarment landed on his wrist during a 2011 show.\n\nCall us crazy, but Kelly’s pursuit of panty greatness calls to mind another talented man: the late Stanley Kubrick. (Yes, film theorists, you read that right.) While it may be hard to picture the mastermind behind The Shining and the singer of “Bump ‘n Grind” having a meaningful conversation, this odd couple has more in common than meets the eye.\n\nKelly: It’s easy to shrug off the mastery of R. Kelly’s music due to song titles like “Feelin’ On Yo Booty,” but the singer likes to be specific. Why else would he have 33 chapters of “Trapped in the Closet?”\n\nKubrick: The Eyes Wide Shut director, who passed away in 1999, was known for demanding perfection. Actors who worked with Kubrick noted it was common for him to do dozens of retakes until a shot was just right. Imagine what his artistic eye could’ve added to “Ignition (Remix).”\n\nKelly: The crooner’s hit claims “I Believe I Can Fly” but R. Kelly secretly has his doubts. The performer has a fear of flying, and he prefers to travel by bus.\n\nKubrick: Born in New York, Kubrick eventually moved to England because of the country’s looser censorship guidelines. As a dedicated homebody, the director avoided flying. Far before the days of Netflix, he would have VHS copies of The Simpsons and Seinfeld shipped to him.\n\nKelly: R. Kelly briefly exchanged songs for sneakers, signing with the Atlantic City Seagulls basketball team in the midst of his musical career – which begs the question, why didn’t Space Jam put R. Kelly on the soundtrack and in the movie?\n\nKubrick: Like many stubborn teens, a 13 year old Stanley Kubrick was certain he wanted to be a jazz drummer one day. This dream quickly evaporated when Kubrick’s dad gave him a camera, leading to Kubrick’s lifelong love for photography and film.\n\nKelly: Black Panties reveals that R. Kelly is a self-proclaimed sex genius, but that isn’t his only area of expertise. Outside the sheets, R. Kelly had more top 40 hits than any other male solo artist in the 1990s.\n\nKubrick: Surprisingly, many of Kubrick’s films were initially panned by critics. However, Kubrick is now considered one of film’s quintessential directors. He is heralded be fellow moviemakers for his willingness to take inspiring risks with filming styles, special effects and musical scoring.\n\nKelly: The R&B star wrote, produced and mixed the majority of his albums. This level of control allows Kelly to steer his musical style any way he sees fit, including an album built around a pair of underwear.\n\nKubrick: The director served as the writer, producer and director on most of his projects, shepherding his films through every stage of creation. he also assisted with cinematography, camera operation and editing.\n\nImage zoom R. Kelly and Jay Z, 2002 Scott Gries/ImageDirect/Getty\n\nKelly: R. Kelly and Jay Z‘s Best of Both Worlds tour ended up being the worst for everyone involved. The duo had continuous issues with one another on the road, allegedly feuding over Kelly’s legal troubles, ego problems and more, culminating in the tour’s cancellation.\n\nImage zoom Marlon Brando in 1961's One-Eyed Jacks and Stanley Kubrick in 1975 John Kobal Foundation/Getty; Silver Screen Collection/Getty\n\nKubrick: Early in the director’s career, Kubrick was assigned to head One-Eyed Jacks, a movie starring Marlon Brando. Brando and Kubrick continually clashed over changes to the film. Eventually, Brando had the director fired and took over the project himself.\n\nLike us on Facebook for more stories like this!\n\nLike us on Facebook for more stories like this!",

        "text": "Image zoom Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe much-discussed Space Jam 2 now has a director (Justin Lin) to go along with its star (LeBron James), and fans of the original (well, me, anyway) have just one question:\n\nHow will the sequel’s soundtrack ever live up to the original?\n\nYou know, the Space Jam soundtrack. The one that gave the world “I Believe I Can Fly” and eventually went platinum six times over? That soundtrack.\n\nReleased on Nov. 12, 1996, below please find a celebration of the singular piece of art that is the Space Jam soundtrack.\n\n\"Fly Like an Eagle\"\n\nIn 1996, Seal had just won three Grammys for “Kiss From a Rose,” which had been re-released as part of the Batman Forever soundtrack in 1995. Getting him on the Space Jam soundtrack must have seemed like a slam-dunk (pun fully intended), but it was his manager, Dominique Trenier’s idea to cover the Steve Miller song “Fly Like an Eagle.” D’Angelo, also managed by Trenier at the time, plays keys on the track, and Seal said he once got a call from Steve Miller thanking him and calling Seal’s version the best cover of the song he’d heard.\n\n\"The Winner\"\n\nSimilarly, Coolio was riding a wave of success from having the Grammy-winning “Gangsta’s Paradise” included on the Dangerous Minds soundtrack in 1995, so having him record another “message” song for the Space Jam soundtrack probably seemed like a great idea at the time. Even though a video for the song, which features a sample of Curtis Mayfield’s “Movin’ On Up,” was produced, it sadly wasn’t released as a single.\n\n\"I Believe I Can Fly\"\n\n“I Believe I Can Fly” is practically deserving of its own oral history. Apparently Kelly and Michael Jordan, attended the same athletic club in Chicago, and Jordan personally asked the singer to record a song for his upcoming movie. Kelly agreed without knowing anything else about the project, but he attended a screening and came up with the idea for the song. In his memoir Soulacoaster, he recounts waking up in the middle of the night at a hotel and going down to the lobby to work on “I Believe I Can Fly.” After about two hours of fiddling with the chords and melody, in walked Notorious B.I.G.: Kelly played him the song’s hook, which reportedly moved the rapper to tears. Kelly would later win three Grammys for the song, which he produced himself.\n\n\"Hit ‘Em High\"\n\nPutting aside the cognitive dissonance of having rappers like Method Man (whose signature Wu Tang song opens with the series of inventive tortures he’s going to inflict on you) and B-Real (from Cypress Hill, best known for their hit “How Could I Just Kill a Man” and prodigious references to marijuana) on a soundtrack for a family film, “Hit ‘Em High” is fascinating because it was produced by Trackmasters, a hip-hop production team who collectively have seven gold and 20 platinum records to their names. The group has not only produced such “serious” hip-hop as B.I.G’s “Juicy” and Foxy Brown’s “Ill Na Na” but also Will Smith’s “Miami” and “Men in Black.” And the song features LL Cool J rapping the line, “If the refs get political, dribble like Bob Dole.” So there’s that.\n\n\"For You I Will\"\n\nMonica’s “For You I Will” was written by songwriting genius Diane Warren, who, among other honors, is the first songwriter in the history of Billboard to have seven hits, all by different artists, on the singles chart simultaneously. Warren also contributed\n\n\"I Turn to You\"\n\n“I Turn to You,” sung here by All-4-One. However, the song would receive a second life two years later when Christina Aguilera would re-record it for her self-titled debut album. Released as the third single from the album, Aguilera’s version of “I Turn to You” would eventually peak at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and become an international hit.\n\n\"Basketball Jones\"\n\n“Basketball Jones” has a weird history: The original was recorded by comedy duo Cheech & Chong in 1973 as a parody of the hit “Love Jones” by Brighter Side of Darkness. It reached one chart spot higher (no. 15 on the Hot 100) than the original, becoming the only parody song to reach higher than its source material. Cheech & Chong’s version was recorded with an absolutely insane backing band: George Harrison, Klaus Voorman (a Beatles friend who played bass on both Harrison and Lennon’s solo records), legendary rock and roll session drummer Jim Keltner, similarly legendary session pianist Nicky Hopkins (who played on records by the Kinks and Rolling Stones, at one point turning down an offer to join the latter group full-time), Billy Preston (who, you know, spent some time with the Beatles), and oh yeah, Carole King. Basically, it was a coincidence that this absurdly talented group coalesced to record a stoner comedy record – Cheech & Chong were recording in the A&M Studios, where all the aforementioned players were working on various projects, and people just sort of trickled in to contribute.\n\n\"Buggin’\"\n\nThis song is notable because it was written by Jay Z, who had, in 1996, just released Reasonable Doubt, an absolute monster of a debut album that is mostly about dealing drugs and growing up in the projects in Brooklyn. And, there is an unverified rumor circulating that out there somewhere, there exists a demo of Jay Z rapping this song as Bugs Bunny. Let that sink in for a minute. (Incidentally, Bugs Bunny is voiced on the soundtrack and in the film by Billy West, the voice of Fry from Futurama, the red M&M and about a dozen other animated characters from the past thirty-some-odd years.)\n\n\"Space Jam Theme Song\"\n\nQuad City DJ’s are C.C. Lemonhead (Nathaniel Orange) and Jay Ski (Johnny McGowan). They are responsible for not just the Space Jam theme, but also 1996’s inescapable “C’mon N’ Ride It (The Train),” which likely landed them the Space Jam gig. They also produced the 69 Boyz’s double-platinum single “Tootsee Roll” and are known for dragging the regional club-based “Miami bass” sound into the spotlight in the 1990s.",

        "text": "R. Kelly never really went away, but in 2013 he has crept back into pop culture nonetheless. He spent the summer headlining large summer festivals, basking in the glow of fans singing his discography back to him. He managed to—if even for a moment—usurp Daft Punk at Coachella during the encore of Phoenix’s closing set, belting out the opening notes of “Bump N’ Grind” to a dead silent crowd waiting for a curtain to drop and reveal a giant pyramid. He would then appear on the remix of the Frenchies’ “Trying To Be Cool” and later on tracks by Justin Bieber (“PYD”) and Lady Gaga. The latter collaboration—the deliciously slinky “Do What U Want”—was a runaway hit that led to appearances on SNL and the American Music Awards, both of which were easily Kelly’s most high-profile television looks in half a decade.\n\nIt has been a fun year for the 46-year-old, an unexpected and smooth resurgence at a time when it looked like he was content to rest in the soft embrace of R&B radio and sold out 5,000 capacity theaters. The nightcap is his 13th solo album Black Panties, which tosses aside the classic soul of his previous two albums (2010’s Love Letter and last year’s Write Me Back) for a deep dive into the sounds of contemporary bumping and grinding. For much of the past 10 years, Kelly’s career has been defined by trying to balance his traditionalist roots with a desire to continually update his sound. He has more or less been able to maintain that balance, like on TP3 Reloaded or Double Up, two albums that feature a number of regrettable collaborations (The Game? Kid Rock??) but also a handful of his most indelible tracks. But we also saw the singer reek of desperation on 2009’s Untitled, a drab and misguided album slathered in AutoTune that is inarguably the low point of his career.\n\nBlack Panties establishes a third position. There is no “I’m a Flirt (Remix)” or “Same Girl” or “Trapped in the Closet” here, standout singles that rejigger his entire career. There are also few if any profoundly novel album cuts—be it anything as truly outlandish as “The Zoo” or effortlessly tuneful as “Kickin’ It With Your Girlfriend” or “Freaky in the Club”—that quietly register as some of his best work. Instead, Black Panties is thematically coherent and consistently listenable, not unlike Love Letter in that sense, though of course different in just about every other.\n\nThe album is almost exclusively about pussy—which, duh, R. Kelly. No one has sung as prolifically about pussy as the man whose debut album sports a nearly seven minute long song called “I Like the Crotch On You\", and perhaps no one will in our lifetimes. On the one hand, Kells reinforces his identity here: for him, comparing pussy to a cookie (on, well, “Cookie”) is not a one-bar metaphor. It is instead an entire song in which he sings about “lick[ing] the middle like an Oreo.” This is the power of R. Kelly: it will be impossible to eat an Oreo for a while without thinking of cunnilingus. He has fundamentally altered your existence.\n\nThere is also something undeniably great about a song like “Marry the Pussy,” in which Kelly gives the song’s subject an entire persona: “Pussy talk to me/Pussy sing to me/ Yeah, so much joy it bring to me.” With a song like this, Kelly allows himself to be more human than the rest of us. It is not ridiculous that he wants to marry a pussy—that level of carnality exists somewhere in all of us, male or female. His brilliance is in routinely bringing out into the open the things that—with good reason!—stay in the darkest corners of our minds. In disrupting the social order, maybe his music helps preserve it as well.\n\nBut, in the context of his own discography at least, Black Panties isn’t as gleefully absurd as we’ve come to expect from him. It’s not exactly that every R. Kelly song needs to construct an entire fable (TP3’s “Sex Weed” is a good example of him losing the plot), but that at its best his dirtiest tracks have the frission of the legitimately unexpected—each song has the potential to be its own developed story, or to shock the public anew. With Black Panties, what you see is mostly what you get.\n\nWhat we get is a pretty good modern R&B album, but it’s also one that feels just a bit fossilized. With its undulating synths, abundance of screwed vocals and slowly churning tempos, Black Panties sounds suspiciously like the-Dream’s first two albums. Tracks like “Throw This Money On You” (which is still pretty great) and “Genius” (which is not) sound ripped almost wholesale from the album in which the-Dream wrote a song called “Kelly’s 12 Play\", where he obsessively details fucking to Kelly’s debut album. At times, listening to Black Panties can be like watching the snake eat its own tail. There are also a number of tracks in which Kelly collaborates with current stars like Migos (“Show Ya Pussy”) or DJ Mustard (“Spend That”), and though none come off anywhere nearly as poorly as his song with OJ Da Juiceman, there is also an instant loss of individuality that renders them a bit useless.\n\nBlack Panties concludes with “Shut Up,” in which he condemns critics, haters and ex-friends who declared his career dead. Considering his numerous past transgressions with minors, the song (which is actually about his vocal surgery) is rather tone-deaf, though that is not exactly a new development either. But it does end the album on a defiant note that is as jarring as it is energizing. The Pied Piper of R&B finds himself head over heels in love with pussy, yet he refuses to settle down. Or maybe, that is precisely why he won't.",

And while Tyga sported a “Secret Location” Alexander Wang sweatshirt, there was nothing secret about their upcoming participation in Wang’s fall campaign. The couple will join the likes of Skrillex and Calvin Harris’s once-rumored girlfriend Tinashe as part of the Wang Squad.\n\nBefore the show, Kylie posted an Instagram of the designer putting some finishing touches on her plunging, pleated silver mini dress. And with all the intricate cut-outs and silver and black detailing, the reality star needed two people to finalize her look. “Pre-Show fittings with Alex,” she wrote.\n\nTyga matched the silver and black theme but kept his look athleisure-inspired with a backwards baseball cap, silver jewelry and black sweatpants.\n\nImage zoom Antonio de Moraes Barros Filho/FilmMagic Antonio de Moraes Barros Filho/FilmMagic\n\nMeanwhile, Kendall looked like she was ready for a day at the beach in a black bikini top, mermaid-like wrap skirt and flip flops. Her hair was styled with beachy waves and she had barely-there makeup on. The look was tied together with a black leather and jewel-encrusted bag that was chained to her wrist.\n\nImage zoom\n\nImage zoom Splash News Online Splash News Online\n\nAnd seated just next to Tyga (and a few away from Madonna!), Nicki Minaj flaunted her figure in an ankle-length black bodycon dress. The rapper, 33, kept it simple with sleek straightened hair and nude pumps.\n\nKylie and Tyga have become fixtures during New York Fashion Week, first getting things started at Kanye West’s Yeezy Season 4 show last week.\n\nOn Friday night, Harper’s BAZAAR‘s celebration of the third ICONS portfolio by Carine Roitfeld, Kylie told PEOPLE she was “so proud” of Tyga after West revealed that he had signed the rapper to his G.O.O.D. Label.\n\nWhat do you think of these Alexander Wang looks? Let us know below!\n\n–With reporting by Jeffrey Slonim",

But team KenGi or team Seymour, no matter where you find yourself one thing is undeniable — there’s a whole new crop of It girls in fashion and whether you call them super or not, they’re not going anywhere anytime soon. So to help you unpack all the faces you’re going to need to know for this coming fashion month and beyond, we’ve compiled a list of the top five major models and their bodies of work thus far so you can be an expert on all things runway just in time for NYFW.\n\nTo quantify just how major these models already are, we’ve broken down all of their most crucial stats from 2016, including social media followers, magazine covers, and runways walked so far this year, to see how the biggest faces in the biz stack up and why it’s more important than ever to know them right now.\n\nKendall Jenner\n\nAge: 20\n\nInstagram Followers: 64.9 million\n\nCovers: 8\n\nRunways: 15\n\nWhy You Need to Know Her Right Now: When Vogue gives a model the coveted September issue cover slot, the industry tends to sit up and take notice. Plus, with the biggest family in reality TV backing her up, it’s hare to imagine this model’s career is going anywhere but up.\n\nGigi Hadid\n\nAge: 21\n\nInstagram Followers: 22.4 million\n\nCovers: 10\n\nRunways: 11\n\nWhy You Need to Know Her Right Now: After booking almost every major catwalk and covers of fashion magazines the world over, Gigi has now transcended the role of muse, becoming a brand collaborator and co-designer, launching her first collection with Tommy Hilfiger this month at NYFW. And after achieving her goal of walking the Victoria’s Secret runway, it seems this top model is going to have to set her sights a little higher.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: ’90s Supermodels: Just As Gorgeous Then As They Are Now\n\nBella Hadid\n\nAge: 19\n\nInstagram Followers: 6.1 million\n\nCovers: 22\n\nRunways: 11\n\nWhy You Need to Know Her Right Now: While Gigi may have garnered all the initial modeling buzz, Bella has been the slow burn breakout success of 2016. Month by month the model’s career seems to be building momentum, booking five big magazine covers in September alone. And with her high profile romance with The Weeknd still going strong, it seems this model’s star will only continue to rise.\n\nTaylor Hill\n\nAge: 20\n\nInstagram Followers: 4.6 million\n\nCovers: 6\n\nRunways: 25\n\nWhy You Need to Know Her Right Now: Taylor has been on a serious roll lately, booking one big magazine and runway show after the next. Plus, with a contract with Victoria’s Secret and a new deal as the face of Lancôme, this model is on the fast track towards household name status.\n\nHailey Baldwin\n\nAge: 19\n\nInstagram Followers: 7.3 million\n\nCovers: 2\n\nRunways: 2\n\nWhy You Need to Know Her Now: Hailey may not be racking up numbers quite as big as those of her contemporary catwalkers, but over the past year her career has been steadily building, with 2017 poised to be her most successful to date. Being BFFs with the reigning queens of fashion, KenGi, certainly doesn’t hurt either.",

        "text": "Image zoom JEN LOWERY/LFI\n\nEXPOSED: New York Yankees slugger Gary Sheffield revealed Tuesday that someone posing as a minister attempted to blackmail him for at least $20,000 with alleged sex tapes of the athlete’s wife with another woman and R. Kelly, reports New York’s Daily News and the New York Post. The alleged tape was purported to have been made more than 10 years ago. In a statement, Sheffield said that he knew his wife, a child gospel star, had had a relationship with Kelly before their marriage, and does not care to see the tape. “I will not be blackmailed (and) have my family dragged through the mud,” he said. The FBI reportedly has suspect Derrick Mosley, of Chicago, in custody. His lawyer would not comment. Kelly (who has pleaded not guilty in a current child porn case) denies knowing anything about this alleged tape, his rep tells the Post.\n\nREQUESTED: Filmmaker Roman Polanski has asked England’s highest court to allow him to sue Vanity Fair magazine for libel via video link so he can avoid the risk of being extradited to the United States, Reuters reports. The director of The Pianist fled the U.S. in 1977 after admitting to having sexual relations with a minor. Polanski, 71, lives in Paris and says the magazine defamed him by accusing him of seducing a woman who was with another man. The Oscar-winning director wants to use the English courts for the suit, but is scared if he goes to Britain he’ll be extradited to the U.S. as a “fugitive from justice.” The law lords are expected to give a decision in writing by early next year.\n\nDELIVERED: Actress Laurel Holloman, 36, the star of Showtime’s The L Word, and her husband, production designer Paul Macherey, 36, welcomed daughter Lola on Nov. 4 in Vancouver, B.C., PEOPLE reports in its latest issue. It’s their first child.\n\nCLAIMED: Liza Minnelli, 58, says her former bodyguard, who claims she forced him to have sex with her to keep his job, and her estranged husband David Gest have joined forces to attack and embarrass her publicly, according to Manhattan State Supreme Court papers filed on Nov. 9 and just posted on the “Celebrity Justice” Web site. The documents also say M’Hammed Soumayah, 56, breached a confidentiality agreement by giving Gest, 52, personal information about Minnelli. The papers note that soon after Soumayah filed his $100 million lawsuit against Minnelli, Gest issued a press release supporting the bodyguard’s charges. Gest has filed his own $10 million lawsuit against Minnelli.\n\nREVIVED: Jennifer Love Hewitt, 25, is being given another chance, as ABC is bringing back her comedy project that the network originally developed last season, says the Hollywood Reporter. The untitled project, which has been given a green light for six episodes, stars Hewitt as a sports producer who unwillingly becomes an on-camera reporter on a sports TV show. Ed O’Neill (Married … With Children) costars.\n\nRELAPSED: Law & Order: Criminal Intent star Vincent D’Onofrio, 46, was back in a hospital Tuesday after fainting for the second time in a week, the Associated Press reports. D’Onofrio was hospitalized for two days last week when he fainted after rehearsing a strenuous scene that included climbing for the New York-based NBC drama. He had been expected to return to work Tuesday. But he fainted again late Monday at his New York home and returned to the hospital for further observation and testing, said a series spokeswoman, adding: “He’s in good spirits and producers are optimistic he’ll be released soon.”\n\nARRESTED: Lionel Richie’s estranged wife, Diane Richie, has been arrested in Beverly Hills for allegedly allowing her boyfriend, Daniel Tomas Fuente Serrano, to convert her bathroom into an illegal cosmetic surgery clinic offering anti-wrinkle treatments, officials said. She reportedly spent a night in jail but was released on $25,000 late Tuesday.\n\nSUED: Alabama writer Glynn Wilson is suing biographer Kitty Kelley, claiming the best-selling author plagiarized his work in her The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty. “I’m trying to make a living down here as a freelance writer and these New York writers rip you off,” Glynn Wilson tells the Birmingham News. The lawsuit was filed last month in Birmingham federal court against Kelley and publisher Random House Inc. Katherine J. Trager, general counsel for Random House, told The New York Times that the lawsuit was “meritless” and that the company was “confident that we will obtain its dismissal.”",

        "text": "Image zoom Frazer Harrison/AMA2013/FilmMagic; Columbia Pictures/Getty\n\nR. Kelly’s album, Black Panties, dropped on Tuesday, but the singer has been planning its release since a certain undergarment landed on his wrist during a 2011 show.\n\nCall us crazy, but Kelly’s pursuit of panty greatness calls to mind another talented man: the late Stanley Kubrick. (Yes, film theorists, you read that right.) While it may be hard to picture the mastermind behind The Shining and the singer of “Bump ‘n Grind” having a meaningful conversation, this odd couple has more in common than meets the eye.\n\nKelly: It’s easy to shrug off the mastery of R. Kelly’s music due to song titles like “Feelin’ On Yo Booty,” but the singer likes to be specific. Why else would he have 33 chapters of “Trapped in the Closet?”\n\nKubrick: The Eyes Wide Shut director, who passed away in 1999, was known for demanding perfection. Actors who worked with Kubrick noted it was common for him to do dozens of retakes until a shot was just right. Imagine what his artistic eye could’ve added to “Ignition (Remix).”\n\nKelly: The crooner’s hit claims “I Believe I Can Fly” but R. Kelly secretly has his doubts. The performer has a fear of flying, and he prefers to travel by bus.\n\nKubrick: Born in New York, Kubrick eventually moved to England because of the country’s looser censorship guidelines. As a dedicated homebody, the director avoided flying. Far before the days of Netflix, he would have VHS copies of The Simpsons and Seinfeld shipped to him.\n\nKelly: R. Kelly briefly exchanged songs for sneakers, signing with the Atlantic City Seagulls basketball team in the midst of his musical career – which begs the question, why didn’t Space Jam put R. Kelly on the soundtrack and in the movie?\n\nKubrick: Like many stubborn teens, a 13 year old Stanley Kubrick was certain he wanted to be a jazz drummer one day. This dream quickly evaporated when Kubrick’s dad gave him a camera, leading to Kubrick’s lifelong love for photography and film.\n\nKelly: Black Panties reveals that R. Kelly is a self-proclaimed sex genius, but that isn’t his only area of expertise. Outside the sheets, R. Kelly had more top 40 hits than any other male solo artist in the 1990s.\n\nKubrick: Surprisingly, many of Kubrick’s films were initially panned by critics. However, Kubrick is now considered one of film’s quintessential directors. He is heralded be fellow moviemakers for his willingness to take inspiring risks with filming styles, special effects and musical scoring.\n\nKelly: The R&B star wrote, produced and mixed the majority of his albums. This level of control allows Kelly to steer his musical style any way he sees fit, including an album built around a pair of underwear.\n\nKubrick: The director served as the writer, producer and director on most of his projects, shepherding his films through every stage of creation. he also assisted with cinematography, camera operation and editing.\n\nImage zoom R. Kelly and Jay Z, 2002 Scott Gries/ImageDirect/Getty\n\nKelly: R. Kelly and Jay Z‘s Best of Both Worlds tour ended up being the worst for everyone involved. The duo had continuous issues with one another on the road, allegedly feuding over Kelly’s legal troubles, ego problems and more, culminating in the tour’s cancellation.\n\nImage zoom Marlon Brando in 1961's One-Eyed Jacks and Stanley Kubrick in 1975 John Kobal Foundation/Getty; Silver Screen Collection/Getty\n\nKubrick: Early in the director’s career, Kubrick was assigned to head One-Eyed Jacks, a movie starring Marlon Brando. Brando and Kubrick continually clashed over changes to the film. Eventually, Brando had the director fired and took over the project himself.\n\nLike us on Facebook for more stories like this!\n\nLike us on Facebook for more stories like this!",

        "text": "Image zoom Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe much-discussed Space Jam 2 now has a director (Justin Lin) to go along with its star (LeBron James), and fans of the original (well, me, anyway) have just one question:\n\nHow will the sequel’s soundtrack ever live up to the original?\n\nYou know, the Space Jam soundtrack. The one that gave the world “I Believe I Can Fly” and eventually went platinum six times over? That soundtrack.\n\nReleased on Nov. 12, 1996, below please find a celebration of the singular piece of art that is the Space Jam soundtrack.\n\n\"Fly Like an Eagle\"\n\nIn 1996, Seal had just won three Grammys for “Kiss From a Rose,” which had been re-released as part of the Batman Forever soundtrack in 1995. Getting him on the Space Jam soundtrack must have seemed like a slam-dunk (pun fully intended), but it was his manager, Dominique Trenier’s idea to cover the Steve Miller song “Fly Like an Eagle.” D’Angelo, also managed by Trenier at the time, plays keys on the track, and Seal said he once got a call from Steve Miller thanking him and calling Seal’s version the best cover of the song he’d heard.\n\n\"The Winner\"\n\nSimilarly, Coolio was riding a wave of success from having the Grammy-winning “Gangsta’s Paradise” included on the Dangerous Minds soundtrack in 1995, so having him record another “message” song for the Space Jam soundtrack probably seemed like a great idea at the time. Even though a video for the song, which features a sample of Curtis Mayfield’s “Movin’ On Up,” was produced, it sadly wasn’t released as a single.\n\n\"I Believe I Can Fly\"\n\n“I Believe I Can Fly” is practically deserving of its own oral history. Apparently Kelly and Michael Jordan, attended the same athletic club in Chicago, and Jordan personally asked the singer to record a song for his upcoming movie. Kelly agreed without knowing anything else about the project, but he attended a screening and came up with the idea for the song. In his memoir Soulacoaster, he recounts waking up in the middle of the night at a hotel and going down to the lobby to work on “I Believe I Can Fly.” After about two hours of fiddling with the chords and melody, in walked Notorious B.I.G.: Kelly played him the song’s hook, which reportedly moved the rapper to tears. Kelly would later win three Grammys for the song, which he produced himself.\n\n\"Hit ‘Em High\"\n\nPutting aside the cognitive dissonance of having rappers like Method Man (whose signature Wu Tang song opens with the series of inventive tortures he’s going to inflict on you) and B-Real (from Cypress Hill, best known for their hit “How Could I Just Kill a Man” and prodigious references to marijuana) on a soundtrack for a family film, “Hit ‘Em High” is fascinating because it was produced by Trackmasters, a hip-hop production team who collectively have seven gold and 20 platinum records to their names. The group has not only produced such “serious” hip-hop as B.I.G’s “Juicy” and Foxy Brown’s “Ill Na Na” but also Will Smith’s “Miami” and “Men in Black.” And the song features LL Cool J rapping the line, “If the refs get political, dribble like Bob Dole.” So there’s that.\n\n\"For You I Will\"\n\nMonica’s “For You I Will” was written by songwriting genius Diane Warren, who, among other honors, is the first songwriter in the history of Billboard to have seven hits, all by different artists, on the singles chart simultaneously. Warren also contributed\n\n\"I Turn to You\"\n\n“I Turn to You,” sung here by All-4-One. However, the song would receive a second life two years later when Christina Aguilera would re-record it for her self-titled debut album. Released as the third single from the album, Aguilera’s version of “I Turn to You” would eventually peak at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and become an international hit.\n\n\"Basketball Jones\"\n\n“Basketball Jones” has a weird history: The original was recorded by comedy duo Cheech & Chong in 1973 as a parody of the hit “Love Jones” by Brighter Side of Darkness. It reached one chart spot higher (no. 15 on the Hot 100) than the original, becoming the only parody song to reach higher than its source material. Cheech & Chong’s version was recorded with an absolutely insane backing band: George Harrison, Klaus Voorman (a Beatles friend who played bass on both Harrison and Lennon’s solo records), legendary rock and roll session drummer Jim Keltner, similarly legendary session pianist Nicky Hopkins (who played on records by the Kinks and Rolling Stones, at one point turning down an offer to join the latter group full-time), Billy Preston (who, you know, spent some time with the Beatles), and oh yeah, Carole King. Basically, it was a coincidence that this absurdly talented group coalesced to record a stoner comedy record – Cheech & Chong were recording in the A&M Studios, where all the aforementioned players were working on various projects, and people just sort of trickled in to contribute.\n\n\"Buggin’\"\n\nThis song is notable because it was written by Jay Z, who had, in 1996, just released Reasonable Doubt, an absolute monster of a debut album that is mostly about dealing drugs and growing up in the projects in Brooklyn. And, there is an unverified rumor circulating that out there somewhere, there exists a demo of Jay Z rapping this song as Bugs Bunny. Let that sink in for a minute. (Incidentally, Bugs Bunny is voiced on the soundtrack and in the film by Billy West, the voice of Fry from Futurama, the red M&M and about a dozen other animated characters from the past thirty-some-odd years.)\n\n\"Space Jam Theme Song\"\n\nQuad City DJ’s are C.C. Lemonhead (Nathaniel Orange) and Jay Ski (Johnny McGowan). They are responsible for not just the Space Jam theme, but also 1996’s inescapable “C’mon N’ Ride It (The Train),” which likely landed them the Space Jam gig. They also produced the 69 Boyz’s double-platinum single “Tootsee Roll” and are known for dragging the regional club-based “Miami bass” sound into the spotlight in the 1990s.",
