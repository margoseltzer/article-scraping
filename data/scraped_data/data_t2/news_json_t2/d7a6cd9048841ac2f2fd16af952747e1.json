        "text": "'Rapists,' 'Huts': Trump's Racist Dog Whistles Aren't New\n\nEnlarge this image Mark Wilson/Getty Images Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\n\"Same insult, different day.\"\n\nEssentially, that was the reaction of many people of color to news on Thursday that President Trump, in a bipartisan gathering to hammer out an immigration deal, had declared the U.S. shouldn't consider taking people from \"these shithole countries.\" The sovereign entities that Trump allegedly reduced to outhouse status were Haiti, El Salvador and most of the African continent. (Trump has since taken to Twitter to deny the claims, saying he \"Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country.\" But multiple people have dismissed that denial.)\n\nIn newsrooms across the country — including here at NPR — the reaction was \"WHAT?!?\" Then, \"Can we really say/print that?\" (Turns out we can.)\n\nIn general, though, the shock wore off pretty quickly. And on social media, many POCs just shook their heads. While some people lamented how far America had fallen with the use of such language, others were more sanguine: Why is anyone surprised at this latest utterance, considering the president's track record?\n\nBefore he was even elected, Trump raised the ire of many Latinos when he announced he wanted to build a wall to keep Mexicans from coming into the U.S. Most of the people here illegally, he said at a press conference, were \"criminals and rapists.\" He wanted those \"bad hombres\" kept out. (As with other of his declarations, there was a little problem with the truth: People living here in the shadows are less likely to be criminals than the native-born.)\n\nThen, months into his presidency, Trump was quoted saying he didn't want anyone else from Haiti coming to the U.S. because \"they all have AIDS.\" Later, he apparently told some staff that there were too many Nigerians in the U.S., and future immigration policy should cut way, way back. If you let them in, he warned, they'll never \"go back to their huts.\" (The White House has since denied this, but that denial got pushback from some people who were in the room.)\n\nBlack Americans didn't escape unscathed either. They should stop their blind allegiance to the Democrats and vote for him, Trump said at a 2016 campaign event, because, \"What the hell do you have to lose?\" The inner cities, he insisted, were full of crime and poverty — \"they're just hell.\" (So ... hell? Shithole? Which is worse?)\n\nThursday's outhouse analogy may have given new life to some of Trump's old insults. Social media have blossomed with sardonically captioned photos of African cities like Lagos and Accra, with their highways and skyscrapers. (\"My hut is in there somewhere...\")\n\nLater in the year, Charlottesville, Va., erupted, and we saw white nationalists streaming through the university town's streets, carrying torches and chanting about how they refused to be replaced by Jews or people of color. There would be no questioning their superiority as white people.\n\nCounterprotests erupted; some became violent, and one woman was killed when a white fascist drove into an integrated crowd and mowed down several people.\n\nYet the nation waited two days for Trump's reaction or statement. And when it finally came, many were shocked. In a brief news conference, the president chided the media for its uneven coverage, even as leaders of his own party squirmed on the sidelines. \"There are very fine people on both sides,\" Trump insisted, saying that antifa demonstrators bore some of the blame for the chaos too.\n\nWhen Trump decided to insert himself into the NFL player protest later that fall, cries of racism became more plentiful. House Speaker Paul Ryan offered a tepid defense of his commander in chief: Trump is not racist, he said in an interview; \"his heart is in the right place.\" The implication was that the president meant well, but sometimes he doesn't say things right.\n\nThat's one way of looking at it. The other way is this: He's saying exactly what he wants to say. As the Congressional Black Caucus pointed out, \"Make America Great Again\" really means Make America White Again.\n\nOne way to do that is to cut back on people from the aforementioned \"shithole countries\" — countries that, coincidentally, are full of black and brown people — to make room for immigrants from countries the president deems more desirable. He seems to like Norway. (Although as one Twitter user asked, why would most Scandinavians, who have higher education rates than their U.S. counterparts and a far more extensive social service system, want to trade that for what we have here?)\n\nPeople from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean are who Trump doesn't want. But he cannot turn back time. The country is getting browner, and America 2018 is never going to look like America 1918. Interracial marriages continue to increase; the bi- and multiracial population steadily grows. And the world has not stopped spinning.\n\nSo yes, calling most of Africa and the Western world's oldest independent black nation the institutional equivalent of a latrine is a new low in racial vulgarity for this president. But we probably haven't reached an absolute nadir yet.\n\nNevertheless, we should worry at the constant stream of racist, crude remarks this president unleashes on the public. Normalizing that kind of behavior leads to what sociologists call \"otherization\" — making the subject of one's remarks different from one's self to the point that it is easier to neglect, harm, even kill people one doesn't see as people. It happened in Germany in 1939. It happened in Rwanda in the '90s. It's happening now in Myanmar.\n\nDonald Trump's relegation of whole nations filled with black and brown people to an undesirable inconvenience is another step down a slippery slope. If it's not called out and stopped, it could lead to something far worse than hurt feelings.\n\nWhich is why we should still take a moment to be shocked when the president of the United States says racist things. Even if you know his history.\n\nEditor's note: NPR has decided in this case to spell out the vulgar word that the president reportedly used because it meets our standard for use of offensive language: It is \"absolutely integral to the meaning and spirit of the story being told.\"",

        "text": "\n\nFrom left, André Carson, Cedric L. Richmond, Karen Bass, Gwen Moore and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus meet with President Trump at the White House. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nPresident Trump, as he campaigned for the job, touted a “New Deal for Black America,” promising to be their “greatest champion” and to rebuild the inner cities.\n\nBut two months into his presidency it's unclear how Trump plans to deliver on his promises. Leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus stepped in Wednesday to help.\n\nDuring their first White House meeting with Trump, the caucus executive team laid out a 130-page policy agenda that includes the core elements of Trump’s campaign: investing in infrastructure and economic opportunity to combat poverty.\n\n“We set our markers and made sure he could no longer say he did not know,” Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) said in an interview following the 45-minute meeting. “We needed him to understand the impact of his decisions and lack of action.”\n\nThe document — titled “We Have a Lot to Lose” — was the CBC's answer to a question Trump asked frequently on the campaign trail as he implored black voters to give him a chance.\n\n“You’re living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs,” Trump said during a campaign stop in Michigan. “What the hell do you have to lose?”\n\nThus far, many black lawmakers remain skeptical, given Trump’s divisive campaign rhetoric and his recent budget proposal to gut many programs for the poor as well as agencies that promote minority entrepreneurship and fund black financial institutions.\n\n“I told him, ‘Sir, your budget is not reflective of your campaign rhetoric. You are now on notice that this is what we have to lose,’ ” Lawrence said, recounting the meeting. “He did not push back. He was not rude. He did listen. I don’t know how far this is going to go, but time will tell.”\n\nThe meeting, which started in the Cabinet Room and moved into the Oval Office, covered a range of topics including criminal justice, education, infrastructure and poverty in urban and rural America. Seven members of the Congressional Black Caucus attended, along with Vice President Pence and other administration officials, including Omarosa Manigault of “Apprentice” fame.\n\n“Throughout my campaign I pledged to focus on improving conditions for African American citizens,” Trump said at the start of the meeting before the media pool was escorted out. “This means more to me than anybody could understand.”\n\n\n\nPresident Trump attends a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus Executive Committee. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nDuring the meeting, the caucus tweeted out updates under the hashtag #ALotToLose.\n\nRep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) highlighted a CBC proposal to require federal agencies to spend 10 percent of their budgets on counties where at least 20 percent of the population has been living in poverty for the last 30 years. The proposal would benefit many low-income Americans, not just blacks, lawmakers told Trump. Two-thirds of the 485 counties that would qualify are represented by Republicans, according to the policy document.\n\nImplementing the initiative to uplift poor communities is all the more important now, lawmakers said, given Trump’s budget proposal to cut health care, home-heating assistance, job training and affordable housing for low-income Americans.\n\nThe lawmakers also told Trump that if his stated ambition to repair the nation’s crumbling infrastructure does result in a bill, the White House should ensure that minority- and women-owned businesses have a chance to compete for federal dollars.\n\nRep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), the first African American to represent Wisconsin in Congress, shared her experience of depending on welfare and food stamps to survive after becoming pregnant in college.\n\nShe told Trump that Republican efforts “to demonize poor people and criminalize poverty was just an effort to justify an upending of entitlement programs like Medicaid and food stamps.”\n\n“These efforts were designed to create a permanent underclass in order to feed the need for a low-wage workforce,” Moore said she told Trump. “I said, ‘Quite frankly, Mr. President, more of the people who voted for you will be impacted than ours.’ ”\n\nMoore criticized Trump’s proposal to turn anti-poverty programs into microloans for poor people. “I told him I don’t think that’s going to work on the street corners of Detroit,” she said.\n\nInstead, Trump should expand microloans to black business owners.\n\nShe said Trump’s budget and policies so far are “really contrary to the kinds of promises that he’s made. And it has an impact on more than just black people.”\n\nMoore said Trump responded by saying that President Obama wasn't able to improve conditions for poor Americans during his tenure — as though he were trying to “absolve himself” of responsibility.\n\nStill, Moore said that although she entered the meeting with a “healthy dose of skepticism,” she left the White House with a “sense of cautious optimism.”\n\nThe White House said that Trump is committed to “improving conditions for distressed communities” and will work with the Congressional Black Caucus to improve economic opportunities and invest in infrastructure.\n\nTrump on Wednesday invited the caucus to meet with him regularly — initially offering to make room in his schedule each month, but later saying it would be more realistic to convene quarterly. He also offered to make his Cabinet secretaries available to delve more deeply into the policy solutions the caucus proposed.\n\nRep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said after the meeting that Trump and the caucus found points of agreement and common goals, such as making inner-city neighborhoods as safe as possible — but they differ on how to proceed.\n\nTrump’s path follows the lines of “law and order,” he said, while the caucus emphasizes “opportunity and education.” The caucus plans to present details of its solutions to Ben Carson, secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n“We consistently fight for poverty no matter if it’s white poverty, minority poverty, black, brown poverty, inner-city or rural,” Richmond said.",

        "text": "This article is more than 1 year old\n\nThis article is more than 1 year old\n\nDonald Trump denied on Friday that he used the phrase “shithole countries” to describe Central American and African nations during talks with US lawmakers the day before. But one of the senators present contradicted Trump and called the remarks he had heard “hate-filled, vile and racist”.\n\nSenator Dick Durbin, a Democrat who was in the meeting, contradicted him to local Chicago press on Friday morning. He said Trump “in the course of his comments said things which were hate-filled, vile and racist”.\n\nDurbin said: “He said these hate-filled things, and he said them repeatedly.”\n\nA few hours later, at an event to honor Martin Luther King Jr, Trump ignored questions from reporters, including one who asked: “Mr President, are you a racist?”\n\nTrump pans immigration proposal as bringing people from 'shithole countries' Read more\n\nOn Thursday, Trump reportedly grew angry during a meeting about protections for immigrants from several countries, and asked: “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?”\n\n“Why do we need more Haitians?” he reportedly added. “Take them out.” He also reportedly suggested the US bring in more people from Norway.\n\nEarly on Friday, he denied using the derogatory language. “The language used by me at the Daca meeting was tough, but this was not the language used,” he tweeted, using an acronym for a program to protect young undocumented immigrants. “What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made – a big setback for Daca!”\n\nTrump later added: “Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said ‘take them out.’ Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings – unfortunately, no trust!”\n\nBut Durbin said: “I cannot believe that in the history of the White House and the Oval Office, any president has ever spoken the words that I personally heard our president speak yesterday. I’ve seen the comments in the press and I’ve not read one of them that’s inaccurate.”\n\nLeaders around the world spoke out in anger on Friday. Haiti summoned the American envoy to the country, El Salvador’s president lodged a diplomatic protest, and the UN’s spokesman on human rights told reporters “there is no other word one can use but racist.”\n\nThe invisible wall: how Trump is slowing immigration without laying a brick Read more\n\nThe Republican senator Jeff Flake also contradicted the president, tweeting: “The words used by the President, as related to me directly following the meeting by those in attendance, were not ‘tough,’ they were abhorrent and repulsive.”\n\nTwo of the president’s closest allies in the Senate, Republicans Tom Cotton and David Perdue, said in a statement: “we do not recall the president saying these comments specifically.”\n\nPlay Video 0:39 ‘Are you a racist?’ Trump questioned over ‘shithole’ comments – video\n\nThe Thursday remarks was first reported by the Washington Post, citing aides briefed on the meeting, and White House spokesman Raj Shah did not deny that the president had used profanity to describe the nations.\n\n“Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people,” Shah said Thursday. He added that the president wanted “merit-based immigration” of people who can “grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation”.\n\nThe president harped on those themes Friday morning, saying that the proposals he saw Thursday were inadequate and even “a big step backwards”. He claimed without specifics or evidence that the deal would force the US “to take large numbers of people from high crime countries which are doing badly”.\n\n“I want a merit-based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. I want safety and security for our people. I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs,” he said.\n\nThat tweet and reported remarks echo Trump’s long history of inflammatory comments about race, including years of spreading a false conspiracy about Barack Obama’s birth, a campaign announcement calling Mexicans “rapists”, and a refusal to condemn white supremacists last summer.\n\nAt the midday event to honor King, Trump decried racism. “No matter what the color of our skin or the place of our birth, we are all created equal,” he said.\n\nThe president left the event without answering reporters’ questions, mostly about his views of people from Central America and Africa.",

        "text": "Steep Rise In Interracial Marriages Among Newlyweds 50 Years After They Became Legal\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nClose to 50 years after interracial marriages became legal across the U.S., the share of newlyweds married to a spouse of a different race or ethnicity has increased more than five times — from 3 percent in 1967, to 17 percent in 2015, according to a new report by the Pew Research Center.\n\nThe Pew report comes about a month before the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Loving v. Virginia. Mildred Loving, a part-Native American, part-black woman, and Richard Loving, a white man, landed in a Virginia county jail for getting married. Today, one in six newlyweds marry someone outside their race, which appears to allude to a more accepting society.\n\nAmong adults who are not black, there's a shrinking share of those who say they would be opposed to having a close relative marrying someone who is black — from 63 percent in 1990, to 14 percent in 2016. The share of people who oppose marriages with Asian or Hispanic people has also dropped from about one in five to around one in ten adults not in those groups. Among those who are not white, the share opposed to a relative marrying a white person has dropped from 7 percent to 4 percent.\n\nHere are some of the other interesting findings from Pew about interracial and interethnic marriages:\n\nAsian and Latino newlyweds are more likely to marry outside of their race or ethnicity than black and white newlyweds\n\nMore than a quarter of Asian newlyweds (29 percent) and Latino newlyweds (27 percent) are married to a spouse of a different race or ethnicity. Those rates go up even higher for those born in the U.S. — to 46 percent for Asian newlyweds and 39 percent for Hispanic newlyweds.\n\nDespite lagging behind Asian and Hispanic newlyweds, black and white newlyweds experienced the most dramatic growth in the rate of interracial and interethnic marriages. The rate for black newlyweds has more than tripled since 1980 — from 5 percent to 18 percent. For white newlyweds, the rate has almost tripped from 4 percent to 11 percent over the same period.\n\nInterracial and interethnic marriages are more common among college-educated black and Latino newlyweds, but not among white or Asian newlyweds\n\nWhile educational level is not a major factor for white newlyweds, black and Latino newlyweds with at least a bachelor's degree are more likely to have a spouse of a different race or ethnicity than those with some college experience or less education. That educational gap is starkest among Latino newlyweds. As the authors of the Pew report, Gretchen Livingston and Anna Brown, write: \"While almost half (46 percent) of Hispanic newlyweds with a bachelor's degree were intermarried in 2015, this share drops to (16 percent) for those with a high school diploma or less – a pattern driven partially, but not entirely, by the higher share of immigrants among the less educated.\"\n\nBut among Asian newlyweds, those with some college experience (39 percent) are more likely to marry someone of a different race or ethnicity than those with a bachelor's degree or higher (29 percent) or with a high school diploma or less (26 percent). \"Asian newlyweds with some college are somewhat less likely to be immigrants, and this may contribute to the higher rates of intermarriage for this group,\" the Pew report suggests. But it also notes that this trend also holds true for Asian newlyweds who were not born in the U.S.\n\nDemocrats are far more likely than Republicans to say that the increase of interracial marriages is good for society\n\nThere is a stark political split in how people feel about interracial marriage. About half (49 percent) of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say that growing numbers of people marrying others of different races is good for society, compared to more than a quarter (28 percent) of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. Most Republicans (60 percent) say the rise of interracial marriages doesn't make much of a difference.",

The New York Times reported Saturday that Trump previously made stereotypical comments about black immigrants in an Oval Office meeting. (Mike Theiler/Pool via Bloomberg)\n\nThe White House is disputing a New York Times report that President Trump allegedly made offensive comments about black immigrants — specifically Haitians and Nigerians. But low confidence in the president combined with his history of controversial comments about immigrants and black people have led some to approach the White House's denial with disbelief.\n\nDuring a June Oval Office meeting attended by top White House officials, the president was supposedly angered by just how many immigrants had received visas to enter the U.S. in 2017, according to six officials who attended or were briefed about the meeting.\n\nTrump had won the 2016 presidential election after promising to be tough on immigration, and his immigration ban was constantly facing pushback and criticism from activists, some members of his own party and the courts.\n\nThe Times reported that Trump had read a list revealing the number of immigrants that had entered the country:\n\nHaiti had sent 15,000 people. They “all have AIDS,” he grumbled, according to one person who attended the meeting and another person who was briefed about it by a different person who was there. Forty thousand had come from Nigeria, Mr. Trump added. Once they had seen the United States, they would never “go back to their huts” in Africa, recalled the two officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive conversation in the Oval Office.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders attacked the Times reporting Saturday in the White House denial.\n\n“General Kelly, General McMaster, Secretary Tillerson, Secretary Nielsen and all other senior staff actually in the meeting deny these outrageous claims. It’s both sad and telling the New York Times would print the lies of their anonymous ‘sources’ anyway,” the Times reported.\n\nBut the denial did not keep activists who have been critical of Trump's policies toward immigrants and comments about black people from criticizing the reported comments.\n\nThe challenge the White House currently faces -- especially among those groups with which Trump is highly unpopular -- is that most people trust the press more than they trust the president. According to a Quinnipiac poll, more than half -- 52 percent -- trust the media more than Trump to tell the truth about important issues. And for many voters, topics related to immigration and race are among the most important.\n\nNigerian American Opal Tometi said Trump's past comments about immigration and black people make the Times report believable. Tometi, executive director of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration and a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, told the Fix via email:\n\n“Unfortunately, it is all too believable that this is how our president speaks behind closed doors because his very public policies have been driven by racism and hatred since Day 1. From his xenophobic Muslim ban to his cruel and immoral treatment of immigrant dreamers, this merely adds crass words to the racist policies this administration has been pushing for a year.\n\n“President Trump is mentally incapable of imagining the humanity of anyone who looks different from him or hails from a different nation,” Tometi added. “This is perhaps nowhere more true than of his treatment of black immigrants.”\n\nJonathan Jayes-Green, co-creator of UndocuBlack Network, a group of black immigrant community organizers, told the Fix:\n\n“I am disgusted but not surprised . . . it’s consistent with the racist, anti-black, queerphobic xenophobe Donald J Trump truly is. It was evident from his decision to end TPS [temporary protected status] for Haiti that he’s both willingly ignorant of who Haitian immigrants are and deeply committed to ending migration of Black and Brown immigrants to this country.”\n\nCandis Watts Smith, who teaches in the University of North Carolina's Department of African, African American and Diaspora Studies, told the Fix that the president's reported comments reinforce “inaccurate” stereotypes about black immigrants.\n\n“The sentiments that the president allegedly voiced about these two groups are in line with common stereotypes and inaccurate, harmful narratives about immigrants of African descent,” she said. “Generally speaking, stereotypes of all sorts have a purpose. For instance, ‘positive’ stereotypes (e.g. hard working, entrepreneurial, highly intelligent) about Black immigrants are often used to suggest that African Americans use racism as ‘an excuse.’ Meanwhile, negative stereotypes (e.g. uncivilized, ‘all have AIDS’) are used to denigrate the group and develop or maintain a justification for preventing immigrants from becoming full members of American society.”\n\nNigerian American activist Tia Oso has worked on immigration issues in Los Angeles, Phoenix and other areas with large Latino populations. She told the Fix she sees a correlation between Trump's views on Latino immigrants and black immigrants.\n\n“I am not surprised that the president holds these views. I also find it really interesting that, while he knew he could use his hate for Mexicans and Muslims to boost his campaign support, that he kept his hate for specific Black immigrants illicit. This is especially telling because he paid lip service to Haitians as a way to detract support from Hillary. But his comments show how he really feels.”\n\nOthers reacting to the alleged comments wonder why Trump would possibly single out Haitians for having AIDS, but author and former Clinton administration aide Keith Boykin said the reported comments reflect a period of great ignorance about the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n\nTrump's \"knowledge\" of HIV/AIDS is stuck in 1983, when people wrongly believed AIDS only affected the so-called \"4-H\" groups: Haitians, homosexuals, heroin users and hemophiliacs.\n\n\n\nThis is why he bans the CDC from using words like \"diversity,\" \"science-based\" & \"evidence-based.\" https://t.co/VneTCMOvRc — Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) December 23, 2017\n\nThe president was criticized earlier this month for his World AIDS Day announcement that did not acknowledge how blacks in America are disproportionately affected by the illness. Nearly half — 48 percent — of those diagnosed with AIDS in the United States are African Americans, according to 2015 statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAnd Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson, a senior policy adviser in the Bush White House, wrote that the Trump administration’s approach to addressing the AIDS epidemic in Africa falls short of his predecessor:\n\n“During the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, the strategy on AIDS was pretty consistent: Put as many people on treatment as possible. Use economies within the program, and falling drug prices, to increase that number even further. Focus on the places and groups where transmission is highest, but act broadly enough to block transmission routes across the continent.”\n\nBut that legacy is now at risk. The Trump administration’s 2018 budget proposes cutting $800 million in America’s bilateral HIV/AIDS programs. And neither South Africa nor Nigeria would be in the “priority” category in the State Department's new AIDS strategy, despite together being home to about a quarter of the AIDS cases in the world.\n\nDespite senior staff denying the president’s alleged comments, according to Huckabee Sanders, the president’s track record with immigrants, including those from Africa, leads some within the community to doubt that Trump’s vision of a great America includes them. Many members of America's immigrant communities have felt devalued by Trump since the day he announced his campaign for president. The policy proposals that followed — combined with comments about black Americans — have led many within the black and immigrant communities to believe that Trump has little to no respect for black people wanting to come to the U.S. to experience the American Dream.",

        "text": "Despite the abundance of evidence that immigration is not linked to higher crime rates, and that immigrants are less likely to be criminals than the native-born, many U.S. policymakers succumb to their fears and prejudices about what they imagine immigrants to be. As a result, far too many immigration policies are drafted on the basis of stereotypes rather than substance. These laws are criminalizing an ever broadening swath of the immigrant population by applying a double standard when it comes to the consequences for criminal behavior. Immigrants who experience even the slightest brush with the criminal justice system, such as being convicted of a misdemeanor, can find themselves subject to detention for an undetermined period, after which they are expelled from the country and barred from returning. This reality is at the core of what law professor Juliet Stumpf calls “crimmigration”—the “criminalization of immigration law.” Stumpf argues that “as criminal sanctions for immigration-related conduct and criminal grounds for removal from the United States continue to expand, aliens become synonymous with criminals.\" In other words, for years the government has been redefining what it means to be a “criminal alien,” using increasingly stringent definitions and standards of “criminality” that do not apply to U.S. citizens.\n\nOf course, these increasingly punitive laws are only as effective as the immigration-enforcement apparatus designed to support them. And this apparatus has expanded dramatically over the past three decades. More and more immigrants have been ensnared by enforcement mechanisms new and old, from worksite raids to Secure Communities. Detained immigrants are then housed in a growing nationwide network of private, for-profit prisons before they are deported from the United States. In short, as U.S. immigration laws create more and more “criminal aliens,” the machinery of detention and deportation grows larger as well, casting a widening dragnet over the nation’s foreign-born population in search of anyone who might be deportable. With the technologically sophisticated enforcement systems in place today, being stopped by a police officer for driving a car with a broken tail light can culminate in a one-way trip out of the country if the driver long ago pled guilty to a misdemeanor that has since been defined as a deportable offense.\n\nMisleading Language in the “Official” Deportation Statistics\n\nThe definition of “criminal alien” used by the federal government is clearly inconsistent with the general public’s understanding of serious crime. The term represents a terminological sleight-of-hand used to justify a punitive approach to immigration enforcement that is based on incarceration and deportation. An important part of the government’s attempt to redefine what it means to be a “criminal alien,” with all the social and legal implications this label carries, becomes clear upon closer consideration of the data on enforcement actions that is released by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). According to DHS, 438,421 foreign nationals were removed from the United States in FY 2013. Among those removed, roughly 45 percent (198,394) were classified as “known criminal aliens.” (Along these lines, the director of ICE testified before Congress that “eighty-five percent of individuals removed or returned from the interior were previously convicted of a criminal offense”).\n\nHowever, a more detailed examination of the data clearly illustrates that the majority of “criminal aliens” are in factnot being removed for what most Americans perceive to be serious crime, such as the FBI’s eight Index Crimes, which consist of “Part I” offenses (homicide, assault, forcible rape, and robbery) and “Part II” offenses (larceny, burglary, motor vehicle theft and arson). In fact, DHS’s FY 2013 enforcement actions indicate that serious crimes such as “Assault,” “Robbery,” “Burglary,” and “Sexual Assault” collectively make up only one-fifth of the crime categories for which “criminal aliens” were removed. Nearly one-third (31.3 percent) of “criminal aliens” were removed for “Immigration” offenses (i.e., illegal entry or reentry into the United States), followed by 15.4 percent for “Dangerous Drugs” (which includes possession of marijuana), and 15 percent for “Criminal Traffic Offenses” (including both Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and “hit and run”). Also noteworthy are an additional 14.2 percent of “criminal aliens” who were removed for “All other categories, including unknown” {Figure 7}.\n\nImmigrant Incarceration and the Rise of the Private Prison Industry\n\nThe criminalization of immigration involves much more than the manipulation of official deportation statistics. It is also driven by a massive expansion in the infrastructure for the detention of immigrants who fit one or more of the growing list of offenses that qualify as “criminal” for immigration purposes. The immigrant-detention industry began to expand in earnest during the early 1980s following the creation of the Krome Avenue Detention Center in Miami to detain Mariel refugees from Cuba. Moreover, at the same time the immigration detention system has grown, the nation’s prison system has become increasingly privatized. The end result is the federal government’s reliance upon private prison corporations, such as Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and The GEO Group, to handle the burgeoning inflows of “criminal aliens.”\n\nAs the immigrant-detention industry grew, so did the redefinition of “immigrants” as an inherently dangerous group of people. This can be attributed in part to the fact that private prison companies work actively to shape the federal and state laws governing corrections and law-enforcement. The companies make sizeable campaign contributions to politicians, and lobby Congress and state legislatures on bills that affect their interests. These companies also belong to organizations such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which champions free markets, limited government, and public-private partnerships that bring together federal and state legislators with members of the private sector. These partnerships can wield considerable power. For instance, there are indications that ALEC and CCA may have played a major role in drafting the legislation that would become Arizona’s infamous anti-immigrant law, SB 1070. This scenario represents a conflict of interest in which a company that has a vested financial interest in the incarceration of as many people as possible is influencing legislation that will increase the flow of prisoners into that company’s prisons. One can only wonder if this business ethic is behind the fact that ICE is now required by law “to maintain an average daily population of 34,000 detainees.”\n\nA Chronology of Criminalization and the Expansion of Immigration Enforcement\n\nThe scale of the federal government’s drive to criminalize immigration and expand the reach of the enforcement dragnet becomes very apparent when the proliferation of immigration laws, policies, and enforcement mechanisms is tracked over the past three decades. The 1996 laws stand as the most flagrant modern examples of laws which create a system of justice for non-U.S. citizens that is distinct from the system which applies to citizens. And, from old-fashioned worksite raids to the modern databases which are the heart of initiatives such as Secure Communities and the Criminal Alien Program (CAP), the government’s immigration-enforcement mechanisms continue to expand and reach deeper and deeper into the immigrant community. In the process, basic principles of fairness and equal treatment under the law are frequently left by the wayside.\n\nWorksite Immigration Raids\n\nFor decades, worksite raids of businesses employing unauthorized immigrants were a mainstay of immigration enforcement in the United States. In recent times, their economic and social destructiveness are perhaps best exemplified by the case of Postville, Iowa. On May 12, 2008, 389 workers were arrested during an immigration raid at Postville’s Agriprocessors, Inc. meatpacking plant. The consequences for the community and the local economy have been dire. According to the authors of Postville U.S.A., one year after the raid, Postville “lost 40% of its pre-raid population, the economy was in shambles, the city government teetered on the brink of financial collapse, and the future of the town’s major employer grew increasingly doubtful with time.” Long after the Agriprocessors raid, Postville was still what its leaders described as “a human and economic disaster area.” The population loss meant steep losses for Postville in taxes and utility revenue. Local businesses closed, rental units remained empty, and the town couldn’t pay its bills. According to the book’s authors: “Attempts to come up with simple black-and-white solutions, such as arresting undocumented workers or closing down the companies that employ them, often causes a host of far more complex situations that do little to address any of the real concerns expressed by either side in the immigration debate.”\n\nThe use of worksite raids as an enforcement mechanism has waned in recent years, although unauthorized workers are occasionally still swept up in such raids. According to ICE, in FY 2012, the agency made “520 criminal arrests tied to worksite enforcement investigations. Of the individuals criminally arrested, 240 were owners, managers, supervisors or human resources employees.” The remaining were workers who faced charges “such as aggravated identity theft and Social Security fraud.”\n\nCriminal Alien Program\n\nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) is perhaps best known for providing an avenue to legal status for most unauthorized immigrants in the country at that time. However, IRCA also spurred the creation of new immigration-enforcement programs targeting noncitizens with criminal convictions. Among those programs were two that eventually became ICE’s Criminal Alien Program (CAP) —a moniker which actually encompasses a number of different systems designed to identify, detain, and begin removal proceedings against deportable immigrants within federal, state, and local prisons and jails. CAP is currently active in all state and federal prisons, as well as more than 300 local jails throughout the country. It is one of several so-called “jail status check” programs intended to screen individuals in federal, state, or local prisons and jails for removability. CAP is by far the oldest and largest such interface between the criminal justice system and federal immigration authorities. CAP also encompasses other activities, including the investigation and arrest of some noncitizens who are not detained.\n\nRegardless of its official intent, in practice CAP encourages local police to engage in ethnic profiling. In particular, police are motivated to arrest as many Latinos as possible in order to snare as many deportable immigrants as possible. For instance, one study found:\n\ncompelling evidence that the Criminal Alien Program tacitly encourages local police to arrest Hispanics for petty offenses. These arrests represent one part of an implicit, but relatively clear logic: the higher the number of Hispanic arrests, the larger the pool of Hispanic detainees; the larger the pool of detainees, the more illegal immigrants that can be purged from the city via the CAP screening system.\n\nThe War on Drugs\n\nStarting in the mid-1980s, the expansion of the infrastructure for detention in the United States was based not only on an escalating crackdown on immigrants, but was also a central component of the “war on drugs.” While IRCA and the Immigration Act of 1990 specifically expanded immigration detention, prisons were also filled with offenders—immigrant and native-born alike—on the basis of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (which created the concept of the “aggravated felony”), the Crime Control Act of 1990, and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, among other laws. In fact, the battles against illegal drugs and “illegal aliens” were frequently linked to each other in the political rhetoric of the time. The result was a growing number of prisons and a growing number of offenders to fill them.\n\n1996 Laws\n\nThe year 1996 was pivotal in terms of the criminalization of immigration. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) transformed immigration law in two profound ways. First, the laws mandated the detention and deportation of noncitizens (lawful permanent residents and unauthorized immigrants alike) who had been convicted of an “aggravated felony,” including individuals who may have pled guilty to minor charges to avoid jail time by opting for probation. Second, the laws expanded the list of offenses that qualify as “aggravated felonies” for immigration purposes, and applied this new standard retroactively to offenses committed years before the laws were enacted.\n\nA classic example of just how unfair these laws can be is the case of Mary Anne Gehris, who was born in Germany in 1965 but adopted by U.S.-citizen parents when she was two years old and taken to live in the United States. In 1988, she got into a fight with another woman over a boyfriend, pulled that woman’s hair, and ended up pleading guilty to misdemeanor assault. In 1999, she applied for U.S. citizenship and found herself in deportation proceedings instead because the 1996 immigration reforms defined her 1988 misdemeanor assault conviction as a “crime of violence.” Fortunately, the Georgia Board of Pardons intervened on Ms. Gehris’s behalf and pardoned her, thereby sparing her from deportation and allowing her to become a U.S. citizen. But many other non-citizens have not been so lucky and have found themselves deported to countries they have not seen since they were children.\n\n287(g) Program\n\nCreated by IIRIRA in 1996, 287(g)—which refers to the relevant section of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)—allows DHS to deputize select state and local law-enforcement officers to perform the functions of federal immigration agents. Like employees of ICE, so-called “287(g) officers” have access to federal immigration databases, may interrogate and arrest noncitizens believed to have violated federal immigration laws, and may lodge “detainers” against alleged noncitizens held in state or local custody. The program has attracted a wide range of critics since the first 287(g) agreement was signed more than 10 years ago. Among other concerns, opponents say the program lacks proper federal oversight, diverts resources from the investigation of local crimes, and results in profiling of Latino residents—as was documented following the entry into a 287(g) agreement with Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona. Following the nationwide expansion of the Secure Communities program, which has its own drawbacks but is operated exclusively by federal authorities, critics have asked whether the 287(g) program continues to offer any law-enforcement benefit. In its budget justification for FY 2013, DHS sought $17 million less in funding for the 287(g) program, and said that in light of the expansion of Secure Communities, “it will no longer be necessary to maintain the more costly and less effective 287(g) program.”\n\nWhile 287(g) may be on the way out, it is important to keep in mind that state governments have repeatedly sought to enlist their police forces in immigration enforcement without the cooperation or permission of federal authorities. Arizona’s SB 1070 and Alabama’s HB 56 are the most notorious examples of sweeping anti-immigrant laws that sought to turn police officers into immigration-enforcement agents. Although major provisions of these laws were struck down in the courts as a preemption of federal immigration-enforcement powers, other onerous provisions have survived. In Arizona, for instance, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the provision of SB 1070 that permits police to conduct immigration status checks during law-enforcement stops. Even if 287(g) programs eventually cease to exist, anti-immigrant laws introduced in state houses will remain a very real equivalent.\n\nSeptember 11\n\nThe U.S. government responded to the attacks of September 11, 2001, in the same way it has in so many other times of national crisis: by using “national security” as a justification for incarcerating and deporting greater numbers of immigrants. “Foreigners” were broadly defined as potential threats and were detained on immigration-related charges that do not require the same standard of proof that is necessary in a criminal investigation. Although federal authorities first targeted Arabs, Muslims, and South Asians in the aftermath of 9/11, the “war on terror” has had an impact on all immigrants regardless of ethnicity or legal status—including Latin American immigrants, particularly Mexicans, who comprise the majority of immigration detainees. Post-9/11 policies not only increased funding for various immigration-enforcement functions as part of the broader effort to enhance national security, but fostered an “us or them” mentality in which “they” are the foreign-born.\n\nMore precisely, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 collectively “illustrate the accelerating criminalization of the immigration system.” This intersection of criminal and immigration law has led to a notable increase in deportations. As Stumpf notes, in the period “between 1908 and 1980, there were approximately 56,000 immigrants deported based on criminal convictions. In 2004 alone, there were more than 88,000 such deportations.” While immigration law had been used by U.S. authorities to remove non-citizens who came into contact with the criminal justice system in the pre-9/11 era, the relationship between these two systems of law intensified after 9/11. As law professor Teresa A. Miller notes, “After the attacks, zero-tolerance enforcement of immigration laws was extended to immigrants who had not passed through the criminal justice system, such as asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants.” The PATRIOT Act in particular allowed federal officers to apprehend and detain “non-citizens on immigration grounds without legal review and without public disclosure of the specific charge for a period of seven days, or for a maximum of six months if the case is deemed a national security risk.”\n\nThe “war on terror” thus had immediate implications for foreign-born individuals residing in the United States. As Miller states: “In January of 2002, Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson announced a new initiative to ‘locate, apprehend, interview, and deport’ approximately 314,000 noncitizens who had been ordered deported, but had failed to comply with their deportation orders.” This initiative led to the arrest of more than 1,100 Muslim and Arab men without formally charging them with a crime. However, the consequences of the PATRIOT Act extended beyond these individuals and into immigrant communities, ultimately being manifested through “racial profiling and scapegoating, mass detentions and mistreatment, and the government’s refusal to disclose information about those detained.”\n\nA prime example of the enforcement-only mindset of DHS and its component agencies in the post-9/11 era is “Operation Endgame”—the name given to the “Office of Detention and Removal Strategic Plan, 2003–2012,” which was released on June 27, 2003, by Anthony S. Tangeman, Director of ICE’s Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO). Tangeman succinctly explains the rationale underlying his department’s new strategic plan:\n\nAs the title implies, DRO provides the endgame to immigration enforcement and that is the removal of all removable aliens. This is also the essence of our mission statement and the ‘golden measure’ of our success. We must endeavor to maintain the integrity of the immigration process and protect our homeland by ensuring that every alien who is ordered removed, and can be, departs the United States as quickly as possible and as effectively as practicable. We must strive for 100% removal rate.\n\nHowever, Tangeman’s assertions about how best to “protect our homeland” ring hollow given that the vast majority of immigrants aren’t criminals (let alone terrorists), and that even minor infractions can render an immigrant “deportable” under current law. Yet the Tangeman memo, and the strategic plan it introduces, treat all immigrants as potential security risks—a paranoid worldview that has become widespread not only throughout the federal government, but in many state and local governments as well.\n\nOperation Streamline\n\nThe federal government’s detention-and-deportation machine is also being fed by Operation Streamline, a program begun in 2005 in the southwest of the country under which unauthorized border-crossers are prosecuted in group trials and convicted of illegal entry into the country—a misdemeanor. If they cross again, they may be convicted of an aggravated felony and face up to two years in prison. Although these offenses have been on the books since 1929, they are being applied under Operation Streamline more widely than they ever were before. Yet the structure of Operation Streamline—in which up to 80 immigrants are tried at a time, and each defendant has only a few minutes to speak to an attorney—practically guarantees the violation of basic legal and human rights.\n\nIn addition, Streamline—which currently operates in all but three southwestern Border Patrol Sectors—has fueled a surge in immigration prosecutions over the past decade, severely straining the capacities of courtrooms along the border and clogging the courts with petty immigration offenses. According to Justice Department data analyzed by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), immigration prosecutions “reached an all-time high” in FY 2013 with 97,384 (53,789 for “illegal entry” and 37,346 for “illegal re-entry”). This marks an increase of 367 percent over the number of prosecutions 10 years earlier. Between FY 2005-2012, a “total of 208,939 people were processed through Operation Streamline,” which represents 45 percent of the 463,051 immigration-related prosecutions in Southwest border districts during this time period. U.S. Sentencing Commission data analyzed by the Pew Research Center finds that the “Dramatic growth over the past two decades in the number of offenders sentenced in federal courts has been driven primarily by enforcement of a particular immigration offense—unlawful reentry into the United States.” Predictably, Operation Streamline has diverted resources away from drug and human smuggling prosecutions. All this means that massive amounts of time, money, and manpower are being wasted on the prosecution of non-violent immigrants who do not represent a threat to public safety or national security.\n\nSecure Communities\n\nAlthough the double standards inherent in immigration law have been applied to immigrants for more than a decade and a half, they took on new meaning starting in 2008 with the launch and dramatic expansion of Secure Communities. This was (or still is, depending on one’s perspective) a DHS program, eventually activated in all 3,181 jurisdictions across the United States, which used biometric data to screen for deportable immigrants as people were being booked into jails. Under Secure Communities, an arrestee’s fingerprints were run not only against criminal databases, but immigration databases as well. If there was an immigration “hit,” ICE could issue a “detainer” requesting that the jail hold the person in question until ICE could pick them up.\n\nNot surprisingly, given the new classes of “criminals” created by IIRIRA, most of the immigrants scooped up by Secure Communities were non-violent and not a threat to anyone. In fact, one report found that in Los Angeles County, “the vast majority of those deported through Secure Communities have merely had contact with local law enforcement and have not committed serious crimes.” Moreover, as the program metastasized throughout every part of the country, more and more people were thrown into immigration detention prior to deportation, which led to mounting financial costs. As of September 30, 2013, 306,622 immigrants convicted of crimes had been removed from the United States after identification through Secure Communities.\n\nMore broadly, regardless of whether they were identified through Secure Communities or not, the overwhelming majority of people receiving ICE detainers while in the custody of local, state, and federal law-enforcement officials had no criminal record. For instance, among the nearly one million detainers issued by ICE during a 50-month period during FY 2008-2012, over 77 percent consisted of individuals who “had no criminal record—either at the time the detainer was issued or subsequently.” Records from this same time period illustrate that for “the remaining 22.6 percent that had a criminal record, only 8.6 percent of the charges were classified as a Level 1 offense” {Figure 8}.\n\nSecure Communities was not a practical or responsible approach to public safety. It undermined community policing by creating distrust of local law enforcement within immigrant communities, which in turn made community members less likely to report crimes or cooperate with local authorities in on-going investigations due to fear of deportation. This had negative consequences for public safety. Secure Communities, along with other programs of its kind, also led to the separation of U.S.-citizen children from their parents. These were issues that could not be fixed by simply altering the program. Further, one study found that “ICE’s failure to adhere to its own stated priorities is a feature rather than a reparable flaw of the program” and “has led to increased use of racial profiling in policing.”\n\nThe current status of Secure Communities is somewhat murky. In February 2013, ICE stated that it would transfer “full responsibility” for the day-to-day management of Secure Communities to CAP, and began to redirect Secure Communities funding towards CAP. But Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson announced in a November 20, 2014, memo that, due to widespread opposition to the program by law-enforcement officers and elected officials, “the Secure Communities program, as we know it, will be discontinued.” It is to be replaced by the “Priority Enforcement Program” (PEP), under which ICE can “issue a request for detention” to state or local law-enforcement agencies if it can “specify that the person is subject to a final order of removal or there is other sufficient probable cause to find that the person is a removable alien.” It remains to be seen how substantively different PEP will be from Secure Communities.\n\nCBP’s Consequence Delivery System\n\nThe systematic criminalization of unauthorized immigrants in particular has intensified along the U.S.-Mexico border. In 2011, CBP, in collaboration with ICE, rolled out a program described as the Consequence Delivery System (CDS). Rooted in the notion of specific deterrence, CDS is designed “to break the smuggling cycle and deter a subject from attempting further illegal entries or participating in a smuggling enterprise.” The program “guides management and agents through a process designed to uniquely evaluate each subject and identify the ideal consequences to deliver to impede and deter further illegal activity.” Possible “consequences” under this initiative include, but are not limited to, being processed through the Alien Transfer and Exit Program (commonly referred to a “lateral repatriation,” often resulting in people being sent to unfamiliar and dangerous Mexican border towns plagued with drug war violence), being repatriated to Mexico in the middle of the night, or being charged with “unauthorized entry” (a misdemeanor) or “unauthorized re-entry” (a felony), which commonly occurs through Operation Streamline. Not only has CDS contributed to the further criminalization of immigration, but it has also needlessly contributed to the increased vulnerability of the already vulnerable unauthorized population.\n\nExecutive Action\n\nWith Congress perennially deadlocked over comprehensive immigration reform legislation, the Obama administration eventually took matters into its own hands. On November 20 and 21, 2014, President Obama announced a series of “executive actions” that would grant a temporary reprieve from deportation, and work authorization, to as many as 5.3 million unauthorized immigrants (5.8 million remain ineligible). This would be accomplished through expansion of the already functioning 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, as well as the creation of a new deferred action program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). DACA offers temporary relief from deportation (and temporary work authorization) to qualified young adults who were brought to the United States as children. DAPA would grant temporary relief from deportation, as well as temporary work authorization, to some unauthorized parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. However, neither DAPA nor the expansion of DACA can get off the ground until the legal challenges to them are resolved in court. So it remains to be seen how the President’s “executive action” will impact the drive to deportation that still permeates the U.S. immigration system. Moreover, the rhetoric used by the Obama administration in justifying executive action—such as saying that immigration authorities will now target only “felons, not families” —fails to account for the fact that there are a great many “felons” who have committed only immigration offenses and pose a threat to no one.",

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\n- In a swift response to reports on Thursday that President Trump questioned why the U.S. should permit more immigrants from \"shithole\" countries, the Congressional Black Congress criticized Trump, adding that his slogan 'Make America Great Again' is really code for \"Make America White Again\".\n\nThe AP report says senators discussed revamping rules affecting entrants from Africa and Haiti as part of a bipartisan compromise to extend immigrant protections, but also to strengthen border control.\n\nThree people were briefed on the Oval Office conversation. The White House did not deny the comment.\n\nDuring the conversation Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, the chamber's No. 2 ranking Democratic leader explained how the changes would negatively impact Africa.\n\nTrump specifically questioned why the U.S. would want to admit more people from Haiti. He also mentioned Africa and asked why more people from \"s***hole countries\" should be allowed into the U.S., the sources said.\n\nIn the caucuses call out, they not only refer to what they call Trump's \"racist policies\" but demand an end any efforts to end the Diversity Visa Program, which benefits immigrants from Africa.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein weighed in on Twitter, calling Trump's comments \"disgusting\" and that they diminish America's standing in the world.\n\nThe Chairman of the caucus, Cedric L. Richmond (D-LA) released the following statement:\n\n\"President Trump's comments are yet another confirmation of his racially insensitive and ignorant views.

Only about one-third of the Rohingya who lived in Myanmar now remain in the country. A recent report by Human Rights Watch said there was also evidence of widespread rape of Rohingya women and girls by uniformed members of the military.\n\nHuman rights advocates said the administration’s use of the label “ethnic cleansing” would add to an international pressure campaign against Myanmar that they hope will come to include a global arms embargo and a suspension of military-to-military relations.\n\nLegislation in Congress would require the United States to cut off all ties to the military. Lawmakers praised Mr. Tillerson’s statement, though some labeled it overdue.\n\n“We cannot let another massacre occur as the world stands by and watches,” said Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee. “The United States has a moral obligation to do all it can to prevent mass atrocities and make clear to those responsible for ethnic cleansing in Burma — and those who look to do the same elsewhere — that their actions will not be tolerated.”\n\nMr. Tillerson’s announcement was also welcomed at the United Nations, where senior officials began describing the anti-Rohingya atrocities as ethnic cleansing more than two months ago.",

        "text": "With 'Otherize,' Pundits Reach Outside The Dictionary To Describe Politics\n\nThe term \"otherize\" has been popping up more this campaign season as a way to talk about Donald Trump's style and tactics. Linguist Ben Zimmer talks to NPR's Michel Martin about the new word.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nNow it's time for our regular segment Word's You'll Hear. That's where we try to understand stories we'll be hearing more about by parsing some of the words associated with those stories. Today, we're going to look at a word we've been hearing more frequently during this election season. And in fact, you might have heard it this past week.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nS.E. CUPP: The Trump campaign has attempted to otherize other candidates when they were surging.\n\nMARTIN: How's that again?\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCUPP: Otherize - other - otherize other candidates.\n\nMARTIN: That's conservative commentator S.E. Cupp on CNN on Super Tuesday using our word of the week to describe what she said was one of Donald Trump's campaign tactics. It turns out that this word, which isn't even in the dictionary yet, has been popping in and out of use over the past several years. We wanted to hear more about it, so we called linguist Ben Zimmer once again. He chairs the New Words Committee at the American Dialect Society. He's also a language columnist for the Wall Street Journal. Welcome back, Ben, thanks for joining us.\n\nBEN ZIMMER: Hi, thanks for having me again.\n\nMARTIN: So Ben, what is she trying to say here? And what are we supposed to understand otherize to mean?\n\nZIMMER: OK, well, people are familiar with the word other, but turning that into a verb may seem a little unusual, at least for people outside of academia. So the idea of treating someone as outside of a particular dominant social group or social norm is generally what is meant when you turn other into a verb. But what we're hearing more frequently is other plus that I-Z-E ending, or even otherization.\n\nMARTIN: So is this new?\n\nZIMMER: Well, turning other into a verb does have a long history. Actually, it goes all the way back to the German philosopher Hegel, who wrote in the early 19th century about consciousness of the self versus the other. And by the early 20th century in English writing, you see the other being turned into a verb to describe the act of making a person or a group be excluded from a particular norm. And that's been called othering. So this otherize form has been showing up more frequently lately. But it's interesting now it's being used on CNN to talk about Trump and how he's handling the other candidates in the Republican race.\n\nMARTIN: Now, you are telling us that that's not the first time you heard that term used in a political context?\n\nZIMMER: Yeah, we've heard that word otherize getting used about the way that President Obama has been treated, for instance. And so Van Jones, another CNN commentator, a progressive commentator was talking about this last year when there was a comment from Rudy Giuliani which seemed to question President Obama's love for his country.\n\nMARTIN: Let's hear that.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nVAN JONES: But it does go to this strategy that he - now apparently even Giuliani has gotten tripped up of trying to otherize the president.\n\nMARTIN: He could have said this is racist, but he didn't say that. He's using a different term. So what's the purpose of this distinction, in your view?\n\nZIMMER: Well, I think that it can refer to race or it can refer to other aspects of social identity. And when it comes up to President Obama, there were sort of various attempts to portray him as not one of us. You could look at the birther movement as an example of that. And even, for instance, the use of his full name by conservative commentators, referring to him as Barack Hussein Obama, could be seen as othering are otherizing.\n\nMARTIN: So the fact that we're now hearing it in the context of an election, does that signal something to you as a linguist?\n\nZIMMER: I think it may have to do with the fact that identity politics itself is just being more discussed.\n\nMARTIN: So do you think that otherize might be a candidate for your list of new words for this coming year?\n\nZIMMER: It could very well be something that we'll be talking about as a Word of the Year candidate. But during election years, we always get lots of very interesting words and phrases coming into the language. And we'll just have to keep track of all of them.\n\nMARTIN: That's Ben Zimmer. He chairs the New Words Committee he at the American Dialect Society. He's language columnist for The Wall Street Journal, and he joined us from our bureau in New York.

They're bringing crime. They're rapists,\" Trump said, at his 2015 campaign announcement. \"Some, I assume, are good people.\"\n\nTrump's stance on illegal immigration worked in last year's election, and state and local politicians facing tough races this cycle have taken notice.\n\n\"His philosophy is the one that's being implemented,\" said Stella Rouse, director of the Center for American Politics and Citizenship at the University of Maryland.\n\nBut she cautions that using that strategy on a state level may be \"risky.\" The ads could alienate moderate Republicans in New Jersey and Virginia who have not fully bought into Trump's sales pitch.\n\nNevertheless, GOP candidates are chasing his voters.\n\n\"[Trump] obviously won,\" Rouse said, \"so there is some sentiment or feeling that that is a winning strategy.\"\n\nThe ads\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jeff Zelevansky/Getty Images Jeff Zelevansky/Getty Images\n\nFor a vast majority of her campaign, Republican candidate Kim Guadagno focused on her plan to lower New Jersey's notoriously high property taxes. She rarely spoke publicly without pitching her plan to streamline state government.\n\nGuadagno also reached out to the state's sizable Latino population, kicking off her campaign at a Mexican restaurant and choosing a Cuban running mate.\n\nBut in October, still down by double digits in the polls to her Democratic opponent Phil Murphy, Guadagno released a TV ad titled \"Sanctuary.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nIt opens with archive video of a shackled man in an orange prison jumpsuit. A gravelly-voiced narrator says: \"Illegal alien and child rapist Jose Carranza shot four New Jersey students in the head. Three died, shattering their families.\"\n\nThe murders on a Newark schoolyard in 2007 became one of the grisliest crimes in recent memory in New Jersey. (A fourth victim was raped, stabbed and shot but survived.)\n\nCarranza, one of six perpetrators, was in the country illegally.\n\nThe ad plays on a comment Murphy made at a press event when asked whether he would protect immigrants who are in the country illegally, even if some of them may have criminal backgrounds. \"My bias is gonna be having their backs,\" Murphy replied.\n\nThe narrator draws the connection: \"Murphy doesn't have our backs. He has theirs.\"\n\nMurphy has said he would make New Jersey a \"sanctuary state\" if threats against immigrants in the country illegally from the Trump administration escalated, but he has provided few details.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sara D. Davis/Getty Images Sara D. Davis/Getty Images\n\nSimilar attack ads are airing in Virginia.\n\nRepublican Ed Gillespie has been slamming Democrat Ralph Northam for voting against a bill that would have banned sanctuary cities in Virginia, even though none exist in that state.\n\nA former Republican National Committee chair who once spoke of diversifying the GOP, Gillespie shifted to the right after a bruising primary in the spring.\n\nIn one ad, the Gillespie campaign implies that Northam's vote against the sanctuary city bill was a boon to the violent street gang MS-13, which was started by immigrants from El Salvador and has a presence in Virginia.\n\n\"Northam cast the deciding vote in favor of sanctuary cities that let illegal immigrants who commit crimes back on the street,\" a narrator says, \"increasing the threat of MS-13.\"\n\nYouTube\n\n'Fear tactics'\n\nBoth Phil Murphy in New Jersey and Ralph Northam in Virginia say violent criminals should be prosecuted, regardless of their immigration status.\n\nBut that response has not stopped their Republican opponents from going all in on the illegal immigration message, even as studies that show immigrants in the country illegally commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born U.S. citizens.\n\n\"Using fear tactics to sort of divide groups is something that has been around for awhile,\" said Rouse. \"I think it's been applied to higher levels certainly since Trump came on the scene.\"",

        "text": "“You also had some very fine people on both sides,” he said.\n\nThe “Unite the Right” rally that sparked the violence in Charlottesville featured several leading names in the white-nationalist alt-right movement, and also attracted people displaying Nazi symbols. As they walked down the street, the white-nationalist protesters chanted “blood and soil,” the English translation of a Nazi slogan. One of the men seen marching with the fascist group American Vanguard, James A. Fields, is charged with deliberately ramming a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old counter-protester Heather Heyer.\n\nTrump on Tuesday made an explicit comparison between Confederate generals and Founding Fathers such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. “Many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee,” Trump said. “This week, it is Robert E. Lee. And I notice that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you have to ask yourself, where does it stop?”\n\nThe substance of Trump’s unscripted remarks hewed more closely to his initial reaction to Charlottesville on Saturday, when he blamed “many sides” for what happened. On Monday, after two days of relentless criticism, Trump gave a stronger statement, saying “racism is evil” and specifically condemning white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, and neo-Nazis. Speaking to reporters shortly afterward, white nationalist Richard Spencer told reporters he didn’t see Trump’s remarks as a condemnation of his movement.\n\nTuesday’s appearance made it even clearer that those words had been forced on the president. Throughout his campaign, he was reluctant to disavow the white nationalists who have formed a vocal segment of his supporters. Asked if he had spoken to Heyer’s family in the days since her death, Trump said “we will be reaching out.”\n\nTrump also addressed swirling rumors about the status of his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who has come in for another round of speculation this week that his job may be in danger. Trump is reportedly angry about the recent book Devil’s Bargain, by the Bloomberg Businessweek writer Joshua Green, which portrays Bannon as the key reason for Trump’s election victory.\n\nThe president defended Bannon as having been unfairly attacked as a racist in the press, but declined to say if he still has confidence in him.\n\n“I like Mr. Bannon, he is a friend of mine,” Trump said. “But Mr. Bannon came on very late. You know that. I went through 17 senators, governors, and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that. I like him. He is a good man. He is not a racist, I can tell you that. He is a good person. He actually gets very unfair press in that regard. We’ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon. But he is a good person, and I think the press treats him, frankly, very unfairly.”\n\nThe remarks echo what Trump told the New York Post earlier this year during a similar moment of uncertainty about Bannon’s position. “I like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late,” Trump told the Post in April.",

        "text": "Trump Embroiled In 2 Controversies About Professional Sports, Race And Culture\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Rogash/Getty Images Jim Rogash/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 5 p.m. ET Sunday\n\nEditor's note: This story contains language that some might find offensive.\n\nIn the span of less than 24 hours, President Trump catapulted himself into the center of two racially charged controversies involving professional sports, reigniting criticism that he is divisive and insensitive — a month after Trump struggled with criticism of his multiple remarks in response to violence in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nThe president was stumping for Sen. Luther Strange, R-Ala., at a campaign rally Friday night, when he used a segue in his speech that was supposed to convince voters that continuing to have Strange in the Senate would make all Alabamans winners — an argument with emotional appeal in a state known for its fierce love of football.\n\nCNN via YouTube\n\nAnd while he was on the subject of football, Trump took the opportunity to expound on his thoughts regarding NFL players, like Colin Kaepernick, who last year began kneeling during the national anthem in protest over perceived social injustices against African-Americans. Trump's take: It's unpatriotic and NFL team owners should fire those refusing to stand.\n\n\"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now'?\" he said to roaring applause.\n\n\"He's fired!\" Trump said, paraphrasing his popular reality TV catchphrase.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Trump took on Stephen Curry of the NBA champion Golden State Warriors in a tweet. The president rescinded an offer for what has become a traditional celebratory visit to the White House for any championship team of a major professional sport.\n\nHe wrote: \"Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team. Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!\"\n\nThe president was reacting to Curry's statement Friday that the popular star player didn't want to visit the White House and meet with Trump because Curry believed that passing on the traditional event would send the message that \"we won't stand for\" some of Trump's past remarks. \"This is my opportunity to voice that,\" Curry also said, of the possibility of not going to the White House as expected.\n\nSaturday afternoon, Trump was back online attacking the NFL.\n\n\"If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nWhile none of Trump's tweets or remarks were explicitly about race, they led to an escalating war of words between the president and black athletes, activists and celebrities on social media. And the president, who was almost immediately cast as being divisive, took a serious pummeling from NFL team owners and notable black public figures.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement Saturday morning, \"Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players.\"\n\nLate Friday night, before Trump had sparked controversy involving Curry, Max Garcia of the Denver Broncos couldn't help comparing Trump's comments about kneeling in the NFL during the campaign rally with how he responded to events in Charlottesville, Va., last month that left one counterprotester dead.\n\n\"What an emphatic response, where was this passion in response to Charlottesville...\" Garcia wrote on Twitter with a video of Trump.\n\nIndividual NFL teams, including the New York Giants, Miami Dolphins, Green Bay Packers and San Francisco 49ers all issued statements Saturday condemning Trump's remarks.\n\nJed York, CEO of the San Francisco 49ers, for whom Kaepernick played last year when he began the kneeling protest, issued this statement:\n\n\"The callous and offensive comments made by the President are contradictory to what this great country stands for. Our players have exercised their rights as United States citizens in order to spark conversation and action to address social injustice.\"\n\nDolphins owner Stephen Ross said, \"Our country needs unifying leadership right now, not more divisiveness. We need to seek to understand each other and have civil discourse instead of condemnation and sound bites.\"\n\nMeanwhile, current and former luminaries in the NBA weighed in online Saturday expressing support for Curry and criticizing Trump.\n\nBasketball megastar LeBron James, who has nearly as many followers on Twitter (38.4 million) as Trump does on his personal account (39 million), defended Curry, his sometimes rival on the court.\n\nJames wrote, \"U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!\"\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, James' tweet has been liked more than a 1.1 million times and retweeted more than a half million times. According to Twitter, the message is James' most retweeted post to date.\n\nJames later recorded and posted a two-minute video to Twitter in which he said, \"It's not about dividing. We as American people need to come together even stronger.\"\n\nChris Paul, who plays for the Houston Rockets and is president of the NBA Players Association, questioned the president's attention to the issue in the first place. \"With everything that's going on in our country, why are YOU focused on who's kneeling and visiting the White House??? #StayInYoLane,\" Paul wrote on Twitter.\n\nRetired longtime Los Angeles Laker Kobe Bryant contributed this to the online conversation, suggesting Trump was not living up to his ubiquitous campaign slogan: \"A #POTUS whose name alone creates division and anger. Whose words inspire dissension and hatred can't possibly 'Make America Great Again.' \"\n\nBy Saturday afternoon, the Warriors formally announced they were not visiting the White House — or Trump. \"We accept that President Trump has made it clear that we are not invited,\" the team said in a statement.\n\n\"In lieu of a visit to the White House,\" the NBA champions added, \"we have decided that we'll constructively use our trip to the nation's capital in February to celebrate equality, diversity and inclusion — the values we embrace as an organization.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ben Margot/AP Ben Margot/AP\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he was \"disappointed\" the team would not be visiting the White House. Curry, for his part, suggested Trump's effort to target him was beneath the dignity of the presidency.\n\nThe dual controversies also elicited reaction Saturday from black celebrities including musician John Legend, actor Jesse Williams and filmmaker Ava DuVernay, among others.\n\nSome politicians also joined the fray on Twitter.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., took a jab at Trump for comments he has made in the past ridiculing Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for being of prisoner of war. \"And if a person wants the privilege of serving as President, they shouldn't be allowed to disrespect military heroes who were taken prisoner,\" Schiff tweeted.\n\nCalifornia's lieutenant governor and former San Francisco mayor, Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, congratulated the Warriors for the stance. \"Couldn't be more proud of the @warriors. Thank you for speaking truth to power and standing up for our fundamental California values,\" he wrote.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a frequent critic of the country's growing divisiveness, suggested that if the kneeling protest spread, NFL players would be playing into Trump's hands: \"btw, Trump wants you to kneel--because it divides the nation, with him and the flag on the same side. Don't give him the attention he wants,\" Sasse tweeted.\n\nSeemingly answering Sasse, Trump backers argued that the president's comments have nothing to do with race and are purely about patriotism and respect for the flag.\n\n\"Has our world turned upside down! Our President criticized for believing our flag & anthem should be respected & honored #StandForTheFlag,\" Ronna Romney, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, wrote on Twitter.\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide Corey Lewandowski expressed similar sentiments on Fox News Saturday.\n\nSome in the Washington press corps wrote Saturday that the president is deliberately using coded language to appeal to his base of white voters who see themselves as part of an aggrieved group in America, rapidly losing power and influence relative to ethnic and racial minorities.\n\n\"To address a largely white crowd as 'people like yourselves,' and refer to protesting athletes, often African American, as 'those people,' does nothing to heal the wounds of Charlottesville,\" political journalist Mike Allen wrote on Axios.com Saturday morning.\n\nRon Brownstein, another seasoned political journalist in D.C., spent most of the day on Twitter putting forth the argument that exploiting racial and economic anxieties and divisions was one of Trump's key political strategies.\n\n\"Point of this fight is not very hard to find- more signaling to white racial resentment, which has been central to Trump message from day 1,\" Brownstein tweeted.\n\nBrownstein reaffirmed his point in a later tweet when another journalist questioned whether Trump was utilizing any strategy at all. \"Yes, pretty clearly from day 1: to appeal to parts of older, blue-collar, non-urban white America most uneasy about demographic & eco change,\" Brownstein wrote.\n\nAnother journalist was more blunt. \"There is an unmistakable racial element at play, since he is targeting prominent black players,\" CNN media reporter Brian Stelter wrote Saturday afternoon about Trump's NFL comments.\n\nAnd Stelter's CNN colleague Chris Cillizza saw something similar, writing Saturday that the context of Trump's criticisms was inherently racial given that both the NBA and NFL have mostly white team owners and mostly black players. Cillizza went on to point out that Trump's comments Friday and Saturday bore two rhetorical hallmarks that went back to his presidential campaign: using racially coded language and espousing a seemingly simplistic view of the black community.\n\nMeanwhile, throughout most of Saturday, the hashtag #TakeAKnee trended on Twitter across the U.S., as people sympathetic to Kaepernick wondered about what NFL players would do Sunday and as they talked about posting photos of themselves kneeling in solidarity.\n\nOn Saturday night, the Kaepernick-style protest spread to professional baseball.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eric Risberg/AP Eric Risberg/AP\n\nCatcher Bruce Maxwell of the Oakland A's took a knee during the national anthem before a game Saturday night in California. Like the rest of his team, Maxwell had his hand on his heart and was facing the flag; as Maxwell knelt, a teammate is shown in photos with a comforting hand on Maxwell's shoulder.\n\n\"This now has gone from just a BlackLives Matter topic to just complete inequality of any man or woman that wants to stand for Their rights!\" Maxwell posted on Twitter on Saturday.",

        "text": "\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Nashville, Tenn., on Wednesday. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nIf you’re a poor person in America, President Trump’s budget proposal is not for you.\n\nTrump has unveiled a budget that would slash or abolish programs that have provided low-income Americans with help on virtually all fronts, including affordable housing, banking, weatherizing homes, job training, paying home heating oil bills, and obtaining legal counsel in civil matters.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign last year, Trump vowed that the solution to poverty was giving poor people incentives to work. But most of the proposed cuts in his budget target programs designed to help the working poor, as well as those who are jobless, cope.\n\nAnd many of them carry out their missions by disbursing money to the states, which establish their own criteria.\n\n“This is a budget that pulled the rug out from working families and hurts the very people who President Trump promised to stand up for in rural America and in small towns,” said Melissa Boteach, vice president of the poverty to prosperity program at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington.\n\nThe White House budget cuts will fall hardest on the rural and small town communities that Trump won, where 1 in 3 people are living paycheck to paycheck — a rate that is 24 percent higher than in urban counties, according to a new analysis by the center.\n\nThe budget proposes housing “reforms” that add up to more than $6 billion in cuts while promising to continue assisting the nation’s 4.5 million low-income households. If enacted, the proposed budget would result in the most severe cut to the Department of Housing and Urban Development since the early 1980s, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n\nIt would also eliminate the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, which coordinates the federal response to homelessness across 19 federal agencies.\n\nThe administration’s changes include eliminating funding for a $3 billion Community Development Block Grant program, one of the longest continuously run HUD programs that’s been in existence since 1974.\n\nThe program provides cities with money to address a range of community development needs such as affordable housing, rehabilitating homes in neighborhoods hardest hit by foreclosures, and preventing or eliminating slums and community blight. It also provides funding for Meals on Wheels, a national nonprofit that delivers food to homebound seniors.\n\nRobert Rector, a senior fellow who focuses on welfare at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington-based think tank, calls the community block grants a “slush fund for urban government.”\n\nThe White House touts its cuts to what the administration characterizes as “a number of lower priority programs” as a way to “promote fiscal responsibility.” In actuality, it guts federal funding for affordable housing and kicks the financial responsibility of those programs to states and local governments.\n\n[What Trump cut in his budget]\n\nGone would be $35 million in funding for well-known programs such as Habitat for Humanity and YouthBuild, fair housing planning, and homeless assistance, among other housing help for needy Americans.\n\nOther targets include funding for neighborhood development and a home-buying program through which low-income individuals help build their own homes. Trump also plans to cut the Home Investment Partnership Program, the largest federal grant to state and local governments that is designed to create affordable housing.\n\n“There is no coordinated plan for how to fulfill the same mission. Saying states, local governments and philanthropy are going to help is just passing the buck,” said a HUD official who is not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nThe official said workers at the agency Thursday morning were feeling “demoralized” and “worried.”\n\n“This is just a tough, tough time,” the official said. “HUD is no different than any other domestic agency in just feeling as though these cuts are all very arbitrary and unnecessary.”\n\nPoor people need not lean on community banks for financial help, either, because Trump plans to eliminate the $210 million now dedicated toward Community Development Financial Institutions. The program, administered through the Treasury Department, invests in community banks that provide loans and financial services to people living in some of the most distressed communities of the country.\n\n“Cutting that program would be nothing short of a disaster, and the ripple effect would be felt in urban areas and some rural areas all over America,” said Michael A. Grant, president of the National Bankers Association, a lobbying group representing minority- and women-owned banks.\n\nThe administration would also eliminate the Energy Department’s weatherization assistance program, which dates back to 1976 when Gerald R. Ford was president. Since then, it has provided states with grants that have helped insulate the homes of about 7 million families, using low-cost techniques that have large payoffs, saving money for those families and curtailing U.S. energy consumption. It has also helped establish weatherization job training centers in states such as Utah and New York.\n\n[Read President Trump's first budget proposal]\n\nAlso on the chopping block: the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known by its acronym LIHEAP. This program, part of the Health and Human Services budget, helps homeowners cover monthly energy costs, or repair broken or inefficient furnaces and air conditioners. The program is usually underfunded; LIHEAP says that on average, only about 20 percent of the households that qualify for assistance receive benefits before the money runs out. Congress sometimes adds funding during emergencies or energy shortages when costs spike.\n\nTrump’s proposed budget would eliminate the Community Services Block Grant, a $715 million program within HHS that funds more than 1,000 local anti-poverty organizations around the country. The organizations provide services ranging from job training to food assistance to more than 16 million people in 3,000 counties. The grants also help communities respond quickly to natural disasters, plant closures and other economic shifts.\n\nWithout the grants, there would be little coordination between faith groups, local governments, private companies and nonprofits in addressing the needs of the poor — “just a few unconnected programs that don’t have nearly the impact they have now,” said David Bradley, who founded the National Community Action Foundation and wrote the legislation behind the grants in the early '80s.\n\nBradley, though, is “absolutely confident” that Congress will reject the proposal.\n\n“This is the work of a radical right that goes hard after anti-poverty programs,” he said.\n\nThe Trump budget would also target the Legal Services Corp., an independent agency that provided $343 million to 134 legal aid organizations for the poor who are tangled up in cases of wrongful eviction, custody disputes, child support or domestic violence.\n\nLegal Services was launched as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s war on poverty with the support of the American Bar Association led by Lewis F. Powell Jr., who later served on the Supreme Court. President Richard Nixon later created a free-standing corporation to administer legal aid funds.\n\n“Here each day the old, the unemployed, the underprivileged, and the largely forgotten people of our Nation may seek help,” Nixon wrote in a 1971 message to Congress. “Perhaps it is an eviction, a marital conflict, repossession of a car, or misunderstanding over a welfare check — each problem may have a legal solution. These are small claims in the Nation’s eye, but they loom large in the hearts and lives of poor Americans.”\n\nIn 2015, Legal Services offices closed 755,774 cases — more than 100 for every lawyer and paralegal employed. About 70 percent of its clients are women, and the majority of its clients are white and between the ages of 36 and 59. The program provides lawyers only to people earning no more than 125 percent of the federal poverty guideline, which is currently $15,075 for an individual and $30,750 for a family of four.\n\n“We have a legal system that was created by lawyers for lawyers and assumes you have a lawyer,” said James J. Sandman, president of Legal Services Corp. “If you’re a tenant facing eviction and you’re up against a landlord who has a lawyer, if you’re the victim of domestic violence from someone who has a lawyer, you are not playing on a level field. Legal aid is about fairness in the justice system.”\n\nAlaska’s rural poor get hit by the budget proposal, despite having two Republican senators. The Agriculture budget would eliminate the Denali Commission, designed to deliver services to remote, rural communities in Alaska, including Native Americans. The commission, established in 1998, contributes to the construction of health-care facilities, water and sewer systems, power generation and communication systems.\n\nThe budget would also zero out funds to help native Alaskan villages obtain access to clean drinking water and modern sewage systems.\n\nAt the Agriculture department, the budget would carve $150 million from the $6.2 billion allocated to “serve all projected participants” in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.\n\nThe White House proposed shrinking Job Corps, a program administered by the Labor Department that provides education and job training to more than 60,000 young people and disadvantaged youth. The proposal called for closing centers that do a “poor job” of preparing students for the workforce, but did not elaborate on how many of the 125 centers nationwide would be targeted.\n\nJob Corps, which was created in 1965 as part of President Johnson’s anti-poverty agenda, helps young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 earn high school diplomas and receive vocational training.\n\n[Labor Dept. cuts target job training programs for seniors, disadvantaged youths]\n\nThe program faced scrutiny several years ago for going over budget and has been forced to freeze enrollment multiple times since 2011 because of the monetary shortfalls. In 2013, a report from the Office of Inspector General found that the budgetary missteps were caused by inaccurate cost estimates and inconsistent monitoring of actual costs. But since then, the program has taken several steps to keep better track of costs and payments.\n\nThe Trump administration would also ax the Senior Community Service Employment Program, which aims to help low-income job seekers age 55 and up find work by pairing them with nonprofits and public agencies. The loss of the program could serve as another setback for older Americans who are still struggling to find steady work after the Great Recession.\n\nThe unemployment rate for workers 55-plus was 3.4 percent in February, according to the most recent jobs report. But the rate rises to 7.1 percent if workers with part-time jobs who want to be working full time, and those who have given up on the job search within the past year, are included, according the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at the New School.\n\nThe goal of the senior employment program is to help participants find permanent work by providing them with training and job experience. Workers are assigned part-time jobs and paid the minimum wage, with the hope that the experience can help them find jobs that are not subsidized by the government. In its budget proposal, the Trump administration called the approach “ineffective” because up to one-third of participants do not complete the program. Of those who do finish, about half succeed in finding more permanent jobs.\n\nNot everyone, though, believes the cuts will be a disaster for the poor.\n\nRector, of the Heritage Foundation, said the cuts cannot be evaluated in isolation when they represent less than 1 percent of the $1.1 trillion in total domestic (including military) discretionary spending last year.\n\n“The basic line from the left is ‘this program alone is standing between the poor and destitution,’” Rector said. “We have a very large welfare state, and there is waste in that welfare state. It’s important to prune the waste and make these programs much more effective.”\n\nJonnelle Marte and Caitlin Dewey contributed to this article.\n\nRead more on the budget:\n\nTrump would increase Energy Department funds to manage nuclear stockpile\n\nAnalysis: Trump’s budget shows a GOP trapped between its past and its future\n\nTrump’s military spending bump could fund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for the next 121 years",

        "text": "\n\nBudget Director Mick Mulvaney, joined by White House press secretary Sean Spicer, left, speaks about President Donald Trump's budget proposal for the coming fiscal year during daily press briefing at the White House, in Washington, Thursday, March 16, 2017. On a cable television show earlier in the day, he said that “folks who voted for the president are getting exactly what they voted for.” (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nIn rural Appalachia, people are so poor that there is a federal program dedicated to lifting them out of poverty. Through the Appalachian Regional Commission, the government pitches in on projects that these rural communities badly need but can’t quite afford — everything from fixing roads, to building computer labs, to training workers, to opening health clinics.\n\nThese efforts have become so widely admired that in recent years Congress launched, with bipartisan backing, sister agencies to help other rural regions stuck in generational cycles of poverty. Together the programs spend about $175 million each year bringing jobs and opportunities to places that long have felt left behind.\n\nPresident Trump, who won rousing victories in these same parts of rural America, would eliminate that funding.\n\nIn his budget outline for 2018 unveiled Thursday, none of the rural development agencies — the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta Regional Authority, the Northern Border Regional Commission — would receive any money. In effect, it would eliminate these programs, which are completely subsidized by the federal government.\n\nIn the context of Trump’s other budget goals, the money at stake is paltry. What the rural development agencies spend in a year is a third of 1 percent of Trump’s proposed $54 billion bump in the military budget. The cost of Trump's increase in military spending could fund them for more than 300 years.\n\nMore than 37 million people would be affected in the 698 counties where the agencies work — in Appalachia, the Mississippi basin, and rural northern New England — places where the poverty rate is 33 percent higher than the national average. By proposing to zero out these programs, the president’s budget would eliminate a key effort to help to some of the nation’s poorest regions.\n\nThe projects aren't always trumpeted as government achievements. Many residents may not know that their local sewer renovation or their high school apprenticeship program was paid for out of federal funds, but states have come to rely on the money.\n\nMuch of the work isn't glamorous; it's focused on meeting basic needs such as clean water and access to medical care. Roads and broadband and other infrastructure projects are expensive in rural areas, which also are too poor and sparsely populated to afford the investments on their own. But such amenities are vital to attracting employers and growing small businesses.\n\nOther efforts more directly combat rural unemployment by paying for training programs or helping people attend college. In Appalachia, for instance, the shrinking coal industry has created a job shortage, and the ARC has spent millions in recent years helping residents find new careers. In Maysville, Ky, it sponsored classes to teach people how to become drone operators. In Cedar Bluff, Va., it helped a community college offer classes in cybersecurity.\n\n“We’re not just handing out federal money willy-nilly to the region,” said ARC spokeswoman Wendy Wasserman. “We work with our governors to make strategic investments. These projects are impactful and have results.” Wasserman declined to talk specifically about the president’s budget.\n\nIn 2015 alone, the ARC says it created or retained more than 23,000 jobs. The agency often uses its funds to get projects off the ground, attracting outside sponsors to help pay for the bulk of the work. According to its annual report to Congress, for every dollar it spends it brings in about $8 in private investment from companies and nonprofit organizations.\n\nMany of these projects accomplish the same goals that Trump has emphasized: promoting manufacturing jobs and building the infrastructure that attracts businesses and supports local entrepreneurs.\n\n“You cannot advocate for infrastructure development and economic security in rural America without also supporting the mechanisms, such as DRA, that make those projects a reality,” said Christopher Masingill, the federal co-chairman of the Delta Regional Authority, which sponsors projects in rural counties near the lower Mississippi River.\n\nAnother strength of these rural development agencies is that they can operate quickly. Projects are approved by a simple vote of the governing board, which includes the governors from the involved states and a federal representative. Masingill offered the example of Marthaville, La., a small town where the local water tank broke down shortly before the holidays in December.\n\n“On Christmas Day, literally, they were not going to have access to running water,” Masingill said. “The governor reached out, and we were able to come together to provide them with some emergency funding within 24 hours.”\n\nDespite Trump's proposal, these agencies are unlikely to be zeroed out next year. What the president has submitted is a wish list, not a mandate, and the power of the purse still rests with Congress. But Thursday's budget outline reveals the president's priorities, and rural development efforts are conspicuously absent from his vision.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump did promise to help blue-collar and rural Americans. The working class was a theme of his inaugural address, in which he described a landscape of “American carnage” and promised to do right by “struggling families all across our land.”\n\n“The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,” he said.\n\nBut it seems the president plans to bring growth and jobs to rural America by other means. He has promised to reverse long-standing employment losses in manufacturing and coal, industries that once formed the backbone of these communities.\n\nIn November, voters in the 698 counties served by the rural development agencies seemed to think that Trump could deliver for them in ways that Hillary Clinton wouldn't. According to a Washington Post analysis, Trump beat Clinton by a cumulative margin of 26 percentage points in these areas.\n\nThe Trump administration claims that the budget makes good on the winning candidate's promises. On Thursday, Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said on MSNBC that “folks who voted for the president are getting exactly what they voted for.”\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story understated Donald Trump’s wins in the affected rural counties. He beat Clinton by 26 points.",

        "text": "\n\nWhile some federal grant money has reached Pikeville, Ky., the small town of Melvin, to the south, has seen better days. President Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate funding that helps some rural communities offer job training and pursue community development, cuts that are running into opposition from Republican lawmakers. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\n— Chad Trador was, like many people here, a onetime coal miner struggling to find work. He, his three children and his wife had stayed afloat in a tough economy for years, but after he was laid off from his job managing a convenience store, the unemployment epidemic in this region appeared to have finally reached him, too.\n\n“The best opportunities I had were another convenience store, maybe as a clerk, making minimum wage,” said Trador, 43, reflecting on last year. “And then I heard that radio ad.”\n\nThe intensive 33-week job training program being advertised — TechHire Eastern Kentucky — promised to teach him computer coding from scratch. It would even pay him decent money while he learned. Trador signed up, and he is on track to complete the training in April, when he will emerge with a job as an Apple iOS developer.\n\nLike many such programs and infrastructure projects here in Eastern Kentucky and across Appalachia, the job training course has the federal government’s fingerprints all over it. The Appalachian Regional Commission, an independent federal agency, helped jump-start it last year with a multiagency $2.75 million grant to a state organization that developed it.\n\nBut after decades of work, the commission’s future is in doubt, with the Trump administration’s 2018 budget proposal threatening to eliminate funding for the commissions and other rural development endeavors. Voters in this part of the country, which overwhelmingly supports President Trump, could be disproportionately affected if that happens.\n\n[If you’re a poor person in America, Trump’s budget is not for you]\n\nTrador, who voted for Trump, said the cuts are a bad idea. The job training program’s funding is secure for several more years, but the absence of further investment, he said, would exacerbate the region’s deep poverty.\n\n“I think it’s horrible. I think that maybe there are some things that don’t need to be funded, but don’t cut things that are working like the Appalachian Regional Commission and the work that they’ve done,” Trador said.\n\nChad Trador, with his dog Tinker Bell, is a former coal miner from Hagerhill, Ky., who has benefited from a federally funded program teaching him how to write computer code. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nAs a political statement, Trump’s budget proposal delighted many small-government conservatives, whose long-held wish for a more focused, less-wasteful government appeared ready to be fulfilled. As a practical political matter, though, the proposed budget’s cuts to pocketbook programs such as this one have few friends in Congress, where members’ political stock often rises and falls based on what they can do for constituents. The result will likely be a final federal budget that bears little resemblance to the one Trump proposed.\n\nIn a statement last week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he would not allow any cuts to the Appalachian Regional Commission, pitting the powerful Republican against a Trump budget priority and opening the door for fellow GOP lawmakers to do the same. U.S. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers (R-Ky.) said he understands that Congress and the White House “have a responsibility” to reduce the deficit. But he worries that cuts to such programs could hurt his Eastern Kentucky district.\n\n“I am disappointed that many of the reductions and eliminations proposed in the president’s skinny budget are draconian, careless and counterproductive,” said Rogers, who was first elected in 1981 and is Kentucky’s longest-serving member of Congress.\n\n[From the archives: Sen. Mitch McConnell’s earmark power credited for revitalizing Louisville]\n\nBecause so much of the Appalachian commission’s budget — $146 million in 2016 — goes toward infrastructure projects, many of the people living in communities that have benefited from the funding are unaware of its impact. The federal funding often goes toward repairing essential services rural towns cannot afford on their own, such as fixing broken sewer systems and revitalizing community centers.\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nWendy Collins, smoking a cigarette outside a dollar store in rural Frenchburg, Ky., grew frustrated when she heard about the recommended cuts to Appalachian development. In recent years, using a community development block grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and a commission grant, Frenchburg has received a combined $1 million to develop a senior citizens center and a regional meal-assistance kitchen.\n\nHUD’s community development grants also would disappear with Trump’s proposed budget.\n\n“Really? Wow. So now what?” Collins said. “The government shouldn’t take it away. This place is below the poverty level. There is nothing here, and people need something to stay out of drugs.”\n\nCollins, 45, who draws disability benefits, became emotional as she spoke about her own involvement with drugs; she estimates she has known about 30 people who have died from opioid abuse. A Trump supporter, Collins said she could not vote for him because she has a felony drug conviction. She thinks Trump should visit the area to see the impact of his budget for himself.\n\n“This community has nothing,” she said. “It needs help.”\n\n\n\nThe offices of a shuttered coal operation are abandoned in Hi Hat, Ky. Hi Hat was originally called Fred but was renamed in 1943 for the Hi Hat Elkhorn Mining Co. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nA former coal mine operation sits idle near Hazard, Ky. The people of rural Kentucky are hopeful that Trump will help bring coal jobs back to the area. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nBut some of Trump’s supporters in the region appear willing to accept development funding cuts because they believe Trump’s broader agenda will help revitalize the region. The president has promised he will bring the coal economy back to life by cutting industry regulations, though experts have largely dismissed the effect such actions would have on jobs.\n\n“As we speak, we are preparing new executive actions to save our coal industry and to save our wonderful coal miners from continuing to be put out of work,” Trump told a crowd in Louisville on Monday. “The miners are coming back.”\n\n\n\nThe locker room of a shuttered coal operation sits abandoned in Hi Hat. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nDavid Conn, 49, of West Liberty, Ky., said he is hopeful Trump can deliver. Conn, a coal miner, said that the region’s problems hinge on the loss of coal jobs. He doesn’t think that will be fixed with federal funding.\n\n“It’s not Trump’s fault if the money’s not there. Somebody’s got to say enough is enough,” Conn said. “People on low income that may be abusing medication . . . sometimes a line’s got to be drawn. I still stand behind him with that.”\n\nWest Liberty last year benefited from more than $250,000 in Appalachian Regional Commission funding, which went into improvements to the area’s water infrastructure.\n\n[Trump budget asks for $6 billion in HUD cuts, drops development grants]\n\nJohnny Kouns, of rural Inez, Ky., voted for Trump and remains confident that the president can help redevelop the Appalachian economy. Kouns, 59, worked in coal fields until 2010. When the industry began to contract, he had to take an early retirement.\n\n“I think he’s doing pretty well considering what he had to take on,” he said. “But it’s not all going to bloom overnight. There’s a lot of work to be done, and there’s a lot of things coming at him.”\n\nThe federal government, through the Appalachian commission, provided funding for the Roy F. Collier Community Center in town to expand its programing with the Dream Discovery Center. The center will promote science and technology education.\n\nMany in the region share the view that coal can be revitalized, and while Trador agreed that perhaps some coal jobs could be brought back, he said the region needs to diversify its economy. He said programs such as his job training — which served an initial class of 50, of which about 35 continued on after the “boot camp” phase — can be scaled outward over time.\n\n\n\nThe town of Inez received $392,000 in federal funding this year to expand the Roy F. Collier Community Center to include the Dream Discovery Center. Federal grant money often goes toward infrastructure projects, and many of the people living in communities that receive the grants often are unaware of their impact. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\n“I think coal can be part of this, but I don’t think coal is the end solution,” he said. “That’s a finite thing. As long as we have the Internet, we can work anywhere.”\n\nSome voters here conflate federal funding of assistance programs — such as food stamps — with those that fund infrastructure and community development. Shane Estes, 43, of Elliott County, grew cynical when asked about the cuts. He said the money would not make a difference in the area anyway because the culture has been too polluted with drugs. Estes, who voted for Trump, said that some employers in the area have stopped drug-testing workers because that would mean they could not hire anyone. And he takes issue with people using food assistance dollars on junk food.\n\nBut what about spending on infrastructure?\n\n“Not here,” he said. “It’s going to get worse around here. It’s not going to get no better. I don’t think Trump can change this; I don’t think anything can.”\n\nMany community leaders who have worked with the grants fear that cuts to federal funding could stymie revitalization.\n\nDanielle King purchased an abandoned building — empty since 1997 — in downtown Mount Sterling seven years ago. She restored it and turned it into a once-a-week bakery. (She’s an internal medicine doctor by trade and has since hired employees to keep the bakery open most of the week. “We’ve created jobs!”) She has become an advocate for revitalizing the entire downtown as a member of the town council, to significant effect. Walking through Mount Sterling, King spoke excitedly as she pointed to several new shops that have joined hers on the street.\n\n“The only thing that was downtown was banks and lawyers,” she said, pointing around. “And this used to be all liquor and bars.”\n\n\n\nDanielle King is the owner of the Spoonful of Sugar bakery and coffee shop in Mount Sterling, Ky. King purchased and restored an abandoned building seven years ago for her shop and was part of the downtown’s revitalization efforts. “If it wasn’t for grants, you would not be able to build and progress in a small town,\" she said. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nMount Sterling has been successful in cleaning up its main street. And it has benefited greatly from federal dollars: There are apartments for the elderly and disabled funded with HUD housing grants, and a $1 million grant in 2010 helped clean up a blighted neighborhood to the north, which had become a center for crime and drug activity.\n\nAbout a mile away, Valerie Scott checked on the newly installed gym floor at the Dubois Community Center, which she and a community board have helped revitalize through commission and community development grant money to serve a largely African American community in the surrounding neighborhood. She said Dubois closed several years ago because of structural problems that rendered it unsafe, leaving the neighborhood without a place to gather.\n\n“That was pretty hard for our community because it was utilized a whole lot. We’re a black community, very small but very strong in this area,” Scott said. “This is a very historical area. We wanted to revitalize it and get it back open.”\n\n\n\nValerie Scott, right, with her daughter Jazz, 15, tours the unfinished basement at the Dubois Community Center in Mount Sterling, Ky. The center is being revitalized through Appalachian Regional Commission grants and other funding. Scott said she fears that with federal budget cuts, the basement, which she hopes will be an area for classrooms, might not get finished. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nBelow the main floor, another level remains stripped and dilapidated. Scott hopes another grant might allow the downstairs to become an educational space.\n\nKing is eager to accelerate the success Mount Sterling has seen. She was reluctant to comment on Trump or the budget cuts, but she said that rather than eliminating grants, the government should be more active when communities have a plan to move forward.\n\n“When you’re in a big city, it’s like the money just rolls in. Everybody gets a piece of the pie. But when you’re a smaller place, they don’t look at you as viable so they don’t want to waste money on you,” she said. “They don’t see our needs; they don’t live here.”",

        "text": "President Trump met with leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus on Wednesday, pulling reporters into the room to hear him praise African Americans.\n\n“They’ve lifted up the conscience of our nation in the march toward civil rights, enriched the soul of America in their faith and courage, and they’ve advanced our country in the fields of science, arts and medicine,” the president said.\n\nAs he spoke, the CBC’s six-member executive board was sitting on the other side of a table — out of the TV cameras’ shot. That was no accident. The CBC, many members of which boycotted Trump’s inauguration, agreed to meet with the president only if the meeting was substantive.\n\n“The Congressional Black Caucus is not going to be a potted plant or a photo opportunity,” said Rep. Donald A. McEachin (D-Va.), a CBC member who did not attend the meeting. “He did a photo op with the presidents of historically black colleges, and they got nothing.”\n\nAfter eight years of working hand in glove with the first black president, the CBC is facing off against a president who portrayed that presidency as a disaster for black Americans — and spent years demanding Barack Obama’s birth certificate and college records. On the trail, speaking before largely white audiences, Trump would ask black voters “what the hell do you have to lose” by voting Republican.\n\nLeaders of the Congressional Black Caucus speak with reporters following a meeting with President Trump. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nThe CBC’s leaders arrived at Wednesday’s meeting with a policy memo titled “A Lot to Lose.” Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), the CBC’s chairman, was joined by Reps. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.), André Carson (D-Ind.) and Anthony G. Brown (D-Md.).\n\n“We never thought we’d agree on everything in this meeting, but the one thing we did ask is for both sides to be candid,” Richmond said afterward. “He listened, and we talked, and we proposed a lot of solutions, many of which I think he had not heard before, and we’re going to keep advocating.”\n\nWednesday’s meeting grew out of an awkward incident last month, when during a 77-minute news conference Trump asked April Ryan, a black reporter with the American Urban Radio Networks, if she could set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n“Are they friends of yours?” Trump asked.\n\nRyan noted that she was a journalist, and not part of the CBC. “I’m sure they’re watching right now,” she said.\n\nThat gaffe started negotiations about a possible meeting, one that CBC members wanted to avoid turning into presidential PR. Since winning the presidency, Trump has had several awkward moments involving African Americans. At a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump thanked black voters who decided to sit out the election: “That was big.”\n\nAt an event he held to mark the outset of Black History Month, Trump rambled about his 80-point defeat among black voters, hypothesized about what could get him to a majority of the black vote in 2020, and mentioned the abolitionist Frederick Douglass as “an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more.” Douglass died in 1895.\n\n“He has not surrounded himself with people who can keep him informed,” said Lawrence, whose state broke for Trump in part because of weakened black turnout. “He painted us as one homogenous group — broke, being shot at, uneducated. He needs to be given the opportunity to learn.”\n\nThe CBC’s proposals for Trump did sync with what he’d occasionally promised on the trail. During the press scrum, Trump said that “every American child has a right to grow up in a safe community, to attend great schools, to graduate with access to high-paying jobs,” implying that African Americans had been denied this. But CBC members are waiting for actual policy proposals.\n\n“There could be something, perhaps, in the area of infrastructure, or in better employment opportunities,” said Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.). “I can’t point to anything he’s done so far.”\n\nInstead, in the White House’s “skinny budget,” spending for domestic programs was cut to make the math work on increased defense funding. In a Wednesday article for the political journal Democracy, Matthew Colangelo, deputy assistant to the president for economic policy in the Obama administration, listed other Trump decisions that disproportionately hurt black voters, such as an executive order that weakened the Federal Housing Administration and a Justice Department decision to abandon a legal challenge — which had been winning in court — against alleged racial gerrymandering in Texas.\n\n“In just two months, the Trump Administration has already made it harder for African Americans to buy a house, to vote, to enjoy clean air and water, and to retire with dignity,” wrote Colangelo. “The President’s campaign pledge was correct: The results of his policies for African Americans have in fact been ‘amazing’ — it is amazing how much harm can be done so quickly.”\n\nAnd CBC members did not quite dodge the photo op. Late Wednesday evening, White House press secretary Sean Spicer tweeted a photo of CBC members sitting around Trump in the Oval Office. The people in the photo shrugged it off.\n\n“Our objective is to walk away having given the president an opportunity to hear, to be enlightened, and to start a dialogue for the next four years — if he stays in office,” said Lawrence.",

They are bringing drugs, and bringing crime, and their rapists,” the business mogul said.\n\nEcstatic internet gleefully quips about Donald Trump's presidential speech Read more\n\nSuch claims were “absurd”, said Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organisation.\n\n“This is a man who has a pathological need for attention,” said Navarrete. “I look at him as a two-year-old who will say a naughty word to get their parents’ attention. That’s what he’s doing.”\n\nTrump has toyed with running for president since the 1980s. He has said he was considering a bid during almost every election cycle since 2000. Tuesday’s event at Trump Tower represents the first time he has fully outlined his policies and political beliefs.\n\nHe aimed specific ire at Mexico, claiming he would build a “great, great wall” on the Mexican-American border, and accusing the country of sending “not the right people” to the US.\n\n“The US has become a dumping ground for everyone else’s problems,” he said.\n\nNavarrete said the claim that Mexicans seeking work in America were rapists was “offensive”.\n\n“This is an exceedingly silly man, who has no idea what he’s talking about,” she said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A brief history of Donald Trump’s presidential aspirations – video\n\nNavarrete said although Trump’s statements had “no basis in fact”, they fitted in with a perception of the party he sought to represent.\n\n“Part of the reason why Latinos are so alienated from the Republican party these days is there’s a sense that there are people who actually believe [what Trump said],” she said.\n\n“I’m hoping that the saner, more rational people in the Republican party can put a stop to this kind of thing, and say: ‘No, we’re going to be constructive, we’re not going to needlessly and consciously alienate the fastest-growing group of voters in this country.”",

        "text": "US diplomats around the world were summoned for formal reproach, amid global shock over Trump calling African nations, Haiti and El Salvador ‘shitholes’\n\nThis article is more than 1 year old\n\nThis article is more than 1 year old\n\nDonald Trump has been branded a shocking and shameful racist after it was credibly reported he had described African nations, as well as Haiti and El Salvador as “shitholes” and questioned why so many of their citizens had ever been permitted to enter America.\n\nUS diplomats around the world were summoned for formal reproach, amid global shock that such crude remarks could ever be made in a semi-public meeting by the president of America.\n\nIn a strongly-worded statement, the UN said it was impossible to describe his remarks as anything other than racist, while the Vatican decried Trump’s words as “particularly harsh and offensive”.\n\nThe 55-nation African Union said the remarks were “clearly racist”.\n\n‘Shithole countries’? Words worthy of a racist-in-chief | Richard Wolffe Read more\n\nTrump initially allowed reported accounts of his comments to go unchallenged, but went into damage limitation mode on Friday, insisting he had not used derogatory words – but admitting that the language he had used at a meeting with Senators on immigration was “tough”.\n\nBut the democratic senator Dick Durbin – who was present at the meeting with Trump on Thursday – insisted that the reports were entirely accurate.\n\nPlay Video 1:20 Trump's 'shithole' comments 'racist and vile', says top Democrat – video\n\nHe said “those hate-filled things and did so repeatedly”.\n\n“Shithole was the exact word used once not twice but repeatedly,” Durbin said, adding that the word was specifically used in the context of African countries.\n\nThe UN human rights spokesman, Rupert Colville, told a Geneva news briefing: “There is no other word one can use but racist. You cannot dismiss entire countries and continents as ‘shitholes’, whose entire populations, who are not white, are therefore not welcome.”\n\n\n\nPlay Video 1:27 Trump's 'shithole countries' remark is racist, says UN - video\n\nSalvador Sánchez, the president of El Salvador, said Trump’s words had “struck at the dignity of Salvadorans”.\n\n“El Salvador formally protests and energetically rejects this kind of comment,” Sánchez wrote on Twitter.\n\nUS diplomats and the US embassy in San Salvador sought to assure those in El Salvador of their respect for the country. Jean Manes, the US envoy to El Salvador, tweeted in Spanish: “I have had the privilege to travel around this beautiful country and meet thousands of Salvadorans. It is an honour to live and work here. We remain 100% committed.”\n\nRobin Diallo, the US chargé d’affaires to Haiti, was summoned to meet the Haitian president, Jovenel Moïse, to discuss the remarks. The former Haitian president Laurent Lamothe expressed his dismay, saying Trump had shown “a lack of respect and ignorance”.\n\nAcross Africa there was diplomatic fury. Botswana’s government called Trump’s comment “reprehensible and racist” and said the US ambassador had been summoned to clarify whether the nation was regarded as a “shithole” country after years of cordial relations. Uganda’s state minister for international relations, Henry Okello Oryem, called the remarks “unfortunate and regrettable”.\n\nThe African Union said it was alarmed by Trump’s language. “Given the historical reality of how many Africans arrived in the United States as slaves, this statement flies in the face of all accepted behaviour and practice,” its spokeswoman Ebba Kalondo told Associated Press.\n\nJessie Duarte, the deputy secretary general of South Africa’s ruling ANC, said: “Ours is not a shithole country; neither is Haiti or any other country in distress. It’s not as if the United States doesn’t have problems. There is unemployment in the US, there are people who don’t have healthcare services.”\n\nThe leader of South Africa’s main opposition party, Mmusi Maimane, described the comments as “abhorrent”. He tweeted of Trump:\n\nMmusi Maimane (@MmusiMaimane) The comments referred to here are abhorrent. He confirms a patronizing view of Africa and promotes a racist agenda. Africa/US relations will take strain from this, with a leader who has failed to reconcile humanity. The hatred of Obama’s roots now extends to an entire continent https://t.co/Kq09tVu0Bo\n\nThe US state department tried to pour water on the flames, issuing a tweet from its Bureau of African Affairs saying that “the United States will continue to robustly, enthusiastically and forcefully engage in #Africa, promoting this vital relationship”.\n\nMexico’s former president, Vicente Fox, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump, said in a colourful tweet that “America’s greatness was built on diversity”. He added Trump’s mouth was “the foulest shithole in the world. With what authority do you announce who is welcome in America and who is not? America’s greatness is based on diversity, or have you forgotten your migration background, Donald?”\n\nDavid Miliband, the president of the International Rescue Committee, said Trump’s comments were leading a “race to the bottom on refugees”.\n\nTrump has made few references to Africa since his election, and many senior Africa-focused posts in his administration remain unfilled.\n\n\n\nIn September, he appeared to invent a new country called Nambia while addressing African leaders in Washington. Trump also told them: “I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich. It has a tremendous business potential.”\n\n\n\nThe US government’s Africa Media Hub made an effort to limit the diplomatic damage of the president’s words.\n\nWithout directly referring to Trump’s statement, a tweet said the “US remains committed to working together w/Africans to realize the promise of a more peaceful, more productive, more prosperous 21st century Africa. US deeply respects the people of #Africa & values its partnerships with them.”\n\nBoniface Mwangi, a well-known social activist in Kenya tweeted:\n\nBoniface Mwangi (@bonifacemwangi) Africa isn’t a shithole. It’s the most beautiful continent in the world. Beautiful,hardworking people. We have diamonds, gold, iron, cobalt, uranium, copper, bauxite, silver, petroleum, cocoa, coffee, tea etc. Sadly we have #shithole leaders like Trump shitting on us everyday. pic.twitter.com/Vv4Wgtq4Pk\n\nStanding at a coffee stall outside an office block in Rosebank, a commercial and business neighbourhood in central Johannesburg, Blessing Dlamini, a 45-year-old administrative assistant, said Trump’s words came as “no surprise”.\n\n\n\n“He has shown the world he is a racist. We should just block him from our thoughts,” Dlamini said.",

        "text": "Trump reportedly disparaged El Salvador and Haiti during pitch to protect immigrants, prompting swift bipartisan rebuke as Democrats called him ‘racist’\n\nThis article is more than 1 year old\n\nThis article is more than 1 year old\n\nDonald Trump described El Salvador, Haiti and certain African nations as “shithole” countries during a meeting with lawmakers on Thursday, according to a report\n\n“Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” Trump said, after being presented with a proposal to restore protections for immigrants from those countries as part of a bipartisan immigration deal. The Washington Post reported the remarks citing aides briefed on the meeting.\n\nTrump demanded to know why the US would accept immigrants from these countries rather than places like Norway, whose prime minister he had met the day before.\n\nQuick guide What is Daca and who are the Dreamers? Show Hide Who are the Dreamers? Dreamers are young immigrants who would qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (Daca) program, enacted under Barack Obama in 2012. Most people in the program entered the US as children and have lived in the US for years “undocumented”. Daca gave them temporary protection from deportation and work permits. Daca was only available to people younger than 31 on 15 June 2012, who arrived in the US before turning 16 and lived there continuously since June 2007. Most Dreamers are from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, and the largest numbers live in California, Texas, Florida and New York. Donald Trump cancelled the program in September but has also said he wants Congress to develop a program to “help” the population. What will happen to the Dreamers? Under the Trump administration, new applications under Daca will no longer be accepted. For those currently in the program, their legal status and other Daca-related permits (such as to work and attend college) will begin expiring in March 2018 – unless Congress passes legislation allowing a new channel for temporary or permanent legal immigration status – and Dreamers will all lose their status by March 2020.\n\nTechnically, as their statuses lapse they could be deported and sent back to countries many have no familiarity with. It is still unclear whether this would happen. Fear had been rising in the run-up to last week’s announcement. Those with work permits expiring between 5 September 2017 and 5 March 2018 will be allowed to apply for renewal by 5 October. What does the recent ruling by Judge William Alsup mean? In his ruling, Alsup ordered the Trump administration to restart the program, allowing Daca recipients who already qualify for the program to submit applications for renewal. However, he said the federal government did not have to process new applications from people who had not previously received protection under the program. When the Trump administration ended the Daca program, it allowed Daca recipients whose legal status expired on or before 5 March to renew their legal status. Roughly 22,000 recipients failed to successfully renew their legal status for various reasons. Legal experts and immigration advocates are advising Daca recipients not to file for renewal until the administration provides more information about how it intends to comply with the ruling. “These next days and weeks are going to create a lot of confusion on the legal front,” said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, which has filed a separate lawsuit against the Trump administration’s termination of Daca. Joanna Walters\n\nIn a statement, the White House did not deny the account, instead highlighting Trump’s hardline immigration stance.\n\n“Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people,” said Raj Shah, a White House spokesman. “Like other nations that have merit-based immigration, President Trump is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation.”\n\nHe added: “[Trump will] always reject temporary, weak and dangerous stopgap measures that threaten the lives of hardworking Americans, and undercut immigrants who seek a better life in the United States through a legal pathway.”\n\nThe president’s comments drew swift and bipartisan rebuke. A chorus of Democrats condemned Trump as a “racist”.\n\n‘Shithole countries’? Words worthy of a racist-in-chief | Richard Wolffe Read more\n\nCongressman Luis Gutiérrez, a Democrat from Illinois, said: “We always knew that President Trump doesn’t like people from certain countries or people of certain colors. We can now we say with 100% confidence that the president is a racist.”\n\nHe added: “This is the real Donald Trump and my biggest fear is that his voters will applaud him.”\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch, a Republican of Utah who has helped implement the president’s legislative agenda, said: “I look forward to getting a more detailed explanation regarding the president’s comments. Part of what makes America so special is that we welcome the best and brightest in the world, regardless of their country of origin.”\n\nHaiti’s ambassador to the US told MSNBC that their government had “formally summoned” a US official to explain Trump’s comments.\n\nVicente Fox, the former president of Mexico and a sharp-tongued critic of Trump, returned the insult on Twitter. He added: “America’s greatness is built on diversity, or have you forgotten your immigrant background, Donald?”\n\nVicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) .@realDonaldTrump, your mouth is the foulest shithole in the world. With what authority do you proclaim who’s welcome in America and who’s not. America’s greatness is built on diversity, or have you forgotten your immigrant background, Donald?\n\nCongressional lawmakers met at the White House on Thursday to discuss a proposal reached by a bipartisan group of senators. Those in attendance included senators Lindsey Graham, David Perdue and Dick Durbin, the only Democratic lawmaker present, as well as congressman Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, Bob Goodlatte and Mario Diaz-Balart.\n\nLawmakers were reportedly taken aback by Trump’s comments.\n\nThe Oval Office meeting came on a day of frantic negotiations on all the aspects of immigration law now in the balance. The fate of hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants remained hanging in the air Thursday after being kicked around Washington amid fierce partisan infighting.\n\nConfusion roiled Capitol Hill as initial optimism that a deal had been struck to avoid the so-called Dreamers becoming vulnerable to deportation was quickly deflated by the White House and conservative lawmakers.\n\n“There has not been a deal reached yet,” said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. “However, we still think that we can get there. We’re very focused on trying to make sure that that happens. ”\n\nRepublican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a member of a bipartisan working group focused on finding a legislative solution for Dreamers, the young people who came to the country illegally as children, set off a firestorm when he announced that the six negotiators had reached an agreement.\n\nThe invisible wall: how Trump is slowing immigration without laying a brick Read more\n\n“We’re at a deal. We’ll be talking to the White House about that and I hope we can move forward with it,” Flake said. “It’s the only game in town.”\n\nWhen Trump ended Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that has allowed nearly 800,000 immigrants to work and go to school in the US without fear of deportation, he gave lawmakers a six-month deadline to resolve the issue.\n\nLawmakers are scrambling to find a solution that also accommodates a list of demands laid out by the president: that the bill increase border security and provide funding for a wall; restrict family-based immigration; and end the state department’s diversity visa lottery.\n\nThe bipartisan group said their agreement meets those requirements and “we are now working to build support for that deal in Congress”.\n\nMeanwhile, Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, told reporters on Capitol Hill that negotiators still have a “ways to go”.\n\nA federal judge earlier this week issued a nationwide injunction, ordering that the administration reinstate the Daca program while the courts deliberate how to rule on the president’s order.\n\nHouse minority leader Nancy Pelosi insisted lawmakers would reach a deal by next week.\n\nShe also mocked a parallel effort to the Senate working group, which consists of the congressional number twos, which includes Durbin, Cornyn, House majority leader Kevin McCarthy and House minority whip Steny Hoyer as well as White House chief of staff John Kelly.\n\n“The Five White Guys, I call them,” Pelosi said. “Are they going to open a hamburger stand next or what?”",

        "text": "Chris Christie suggests Republican presidential nominee gave up saying Barack Obama was not born in the US years ago\n\nThis article is more than 2 years old\n\nThis article is more than 2 years old\n\nDonald Trump’s closest allies struggled on Sunday to defend the Republican nominee, falsely saying he gave up the lie that Barack Obama was not born in the United States years ago.\n\nDonald Trump's police: officers backing Republican have murky legal histories Read more\n\nTrump has falsely claimed that the president was born outside the US since at least 2011, when he began to air the conspiracy theory in TV interviews. Even since Obama released his birth certificate, in April 2011, and Trump was roundly mocked for the lie, the businessman has continued to question the president’s birthplace in the face of all facts and logic.\n\nAs recently as February 2015, Trump continued to suggest the certificate was forged, saying: “Now all we have to do is find out whether or not it’s real.”\n\nOn Friday, Trump claimed to have “ended” the conspiracy, which he blamed on Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign, and said he now believed the veracity of the birth certificate. In an interview broadcast on Sunday, however, his vice-presidential candidate still struggled to account for his running mate’s behaviour.\n\n“He brought that issue to an end this week,” Mike Pence told ABC’s This Week. “It is a fact, and Donald Trump and I have acknowledged that without hesitation.”\n\nIn fact, on Thursday Trump refused to admit that Obama was born in Hawaii.\n\nNew Jersey governor Chris Christie, the first major politician to endose Trump after abandoning his own presidential campaign, similarly tried to wall off the candidate by laying down a series of falsehoods.\n\n“It’s just not true that he kept [the claims] up for five years,” Christie told CNN’s State of the Union, calling the matter “a contentious issue” – although in fact only a fringe group of conservatives ever embraced the so-called “birther” movement. “Donald Trump has said it’s a done issue now.”\n\nLast September, Christie said he “would correct” Trump about the lie, telling NBC: “I’d say that the president is a Christian and he was born in this country. Those two things are self-evident.”\n\nBut on Sunday the governor falsely laid blame at the feet of Clinton allies – it has been alleged that longtime aide Sidney Blumenthal spread the rumour in 2008 – saying that it was they who created and spread the conspiracy theory. Like Pence, Christie also falsely claimed that Trump has not indulged the lie for years.\n\n“It’s not like he was talking about it on a regular basis,” Christie said.\n\nIn fact, the businessman has regularly raised the conspiracy theory. In August 2012, for instance, Trump wrote: “An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that @BarackObama’s birth certificate is a fraud.”\n\nA year later, he wrote: “How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama’s ‘birth certificate’ died in plane crash today. All others lived.”\n\nAnd in September 2014, among dozens of tweets, he wrote: “Attention all hackers: You are hacking everything else so please hack Obama’s college records (destroyed?) and check ‘place of birth.’”\n\nClinton’s running mate, Tim Kaine, told CNN on Sunday: “Sidney Blumenthal has categorically denied that but Sidney Blumenthal is not running for president. Let’s talk about Trump.”\n\nTrump, he said, had courted racism and delegitimization of the president with the theory. “Did you believe it?” he said he would ask Trump. “In which case, how gullible were you? Or were you just trying to cynically play to the darkest emotions in American life?”\n\nThe lie, Kaine concluded, was evidence that Trump “has proven himself unfit” for the presidency.\n\nPence and Christie were also forced to defend Trump for his insinuations about violence against Clinton and his refusal to share tax returns with voters, breaking 40 years of precedent.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said Clinton’s secret service protection should “disarm immediately” so that he could “see what happens to her”. Pence claimed it was “absolute nonsense” to hear an encouragement of violence in those remarks.\n\n“His comment was that if she didn’t have security, she’d change her attitude about the right to keep and bear arms. And I’ll bet that’s probably true,” Pence said. He added falsely that Clinton has ‘private security’, though she has had secret service protection for decades. Although Pence and Trump also enjoy that protection, Trump also employs private security.\n\nChristie said Trump was within his rights to not release his tax returns, even though no law prohibits their release while under audit and every candidate since 1976 has released returns.\n\nTrump was “following the advice of his lawyers and his counsel”, Christie said.\n\nEarlier this month, Pence released 10 years of tax returns. This week, House speaker Paul Ryan, the 2012 vice-presidential nominee and top Republican in Washington, said Trump should release his own.\n\n“I released mine. I think he should release his,” Ryan told reporters.\n\nTrump’s campaign manager, meanwhile, tried to fend off scathing remarks by Robert Gates, defense secretary for George W Bush and Barack Obama and a widely respected leader with 50 years experience.\n\nOn Saturday, Gates wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal that Trump was “beyond repair” in his understanding of the world, “oblivious to the reality” of the Middle East and “willfully ignorant”.\n\nTrump responded by calling Gates “dopey” at a campaign event and writing on Twitter that the former CIA director had created a “total disaster”. On CNN, Christie rejected a suggestion that he would not tolerate such insulting behavior in one of his own children.\n\nOn CBS’s Face the Nation, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Gates, who helped restore stability to Iraq during its brutal, post-invasion civil war, did not appreciate the threat of terrorism.\n\n“He acts like terrorism is something like the weather, it just happens, and we as Americans know that’s not true,” she said.\n\n",

        "text": "President laments ‘hatred, bigotry and violence from many sides’ but senior Republicans and Democrats demand condemnation of far-right extremists\n\nDonald Trump has faced bipartisan criticism after failing to explicitly condemn the role of white supremacists in clashes with counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, that culminated in a car running into a crowd, killing at least one person.\n\nThe president said he condemned “hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides” on Saturday. He then repeated the phrase “on many sides” for emphasis. A White House spokesperson later amplified the president’s remarks, telling the Guardian: “The president was condemning hatred, bigotry and violence from all sources and all sides. There was violence between protesters and counter-protesters today.”\n\nBut there was strong reaction to Trump’s refusal to denounce far-right extremists who had marched through the streets carrying flaming torches, screaming racial epithets and setting upon their opponents.\n\nThe clashes started after white nationalists planned a rally around a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee that is slated to be removed, and culminated in a car being deliberately driven into a group of people peacefully protesting the far right rally, killing one person and injuring at least 19. Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, described the car ramming as an act of “domestic terrorism”.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a previously scheduled event in Bedminster, New Jersey, to discuss healthcare for veterans, Trump said: “I should put out a comment as to what’s going on in Charlottesville.”\n\nAfter stopping to shake the hands of the assembled veterans, the president said: “We’re closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia. We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.” Trump added that this had been “going on for a long time in our country. Not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. A long, long time.” Trump added: “What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order.”\n\nTrump urged Americans to “love each other, respect each other and cherish our history and our future together. So important. We have to respect each other. Ideally, we have to love each other.”\n\nHowever, Trump’s remarks met condemnation for being inadequate – not just from Democrats but many members of his own party as well.\n\nThe Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio was among those calling for a straightforward condemnation:\n\nMarco Rubio (@marcorubio) Very important for the nation to hear @potus describe events in #Charlottesville for what they are, a terror attack by #whitesupremacists\n\nThe Republican senator Cory Gardner of Colorado tweeted: “Mr President – we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism.” This was echoed by Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah who lost a brother in the second world war. “We should call evil by its name. My brother didn’t give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home,” said Hatch on Twitter.\n\nThese calls for specific condemnation were echoed by a number of Democrats. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said in a statement: “The march and rally in Charlottesville goes against everything the American flag stands for. President Trump must condemn this in the strongest terms immediately.” The Hawaii senator Brian Schatz offered a pointed comment on Twitter,: “It is not too much to ask to have a president who explicitly condemns nazis.” Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, tweeted at Trump: “No, Mr. President. This is a provocative effort by Neo-Nazis to foment racism and hatred and create violence. Call it out for what it is.”\n\nPlay Video 1:34 Virginia governor says 'go home' to white supremacists and nazis – video\n\nBefore Trump’s remarks, Republican congressional leaders issued strong statements about the events in Virginia.\n\n\n\nThe Republican House speaker, Paul Ryan, tweeted: “The views fueling the spectacle in Charlottesville are repugnant. Let it only serve to unite Americans against this kind of vile bigotry.”\n\nThe Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, tweeted: “The hate and bigotry witnessed in #Charlottesville does not reflect American values. I wholeheartedly oppose their actions.”\n\nMike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and father of the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, issued a strident tweet about white nationalism. “‘White supremacy’ crap is worst kind of racism – it’s EVIL and perversion of God’s truth to ever think our Creator values some above others,” Huckabee said on Twitter.\n\nCharlottesville: car runs into crowd amid violence at planned far-right protest Read more\n\nEarlier in the day, the initial White House response came from the Twitter account of the first lady, Melania Trump, not the president: “Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let’s communicate w/o hate in our hearts. No good comes from violence. #Charlottesville” at 12:36 on Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe president did not issue a statement until 40 minutes later, when he said on Twitter: “We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!”\n\nDavid Duke, the former head of the Ku Klux Klan who was the subject of controversy during the 2016 campaign when Trump did not immediately condemn his endorsement, pushed back on this initial tweet. “I would recommend you take a good look in the mirror & remember it was White Americans who put you in the presidency, not radical leftists,” responded Duke, who was in Charlottesville.\n\nTrump did not specifically mention Charlottesville until a following statement on Twitter, in which he described the clashes as “Sad!” Trump tweeted: “Am in Bedminster for meetings & press conference on V.A. & all that we have done, and are doing, to make it better-but Charlottesville sad!”\n\nThe president, in his responses, bemoaned that the clashes were happening when “our country is doing so well in so many ways”, citing low unemployment and the renegotiation of trade deals. He noted: “We have so many incredible things happening in our country, so when I watch Charlottesville, to me it’s very, very sad.”\n\nThe White House response also included a since deleted tweet from the homeland security adviser Tom Bossert, in which he condemned “the violence and hate in Charlotte”. The city of Charlotte is in North Carolina.",

        "text": "President Trump grew frustrated with lawmakers Thursday in the Oval Office when they discussed protecting immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and African countries as part of a bipartisan immigration deal, according to several people briefed on the meeting.\n\n\"Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?\" Trump said, according to these people, referring to countries mentioned by the lawmakers.\n\nTrump then suggested that the United States should instead bring more people from countries such as Norway, whose prime minister he met with Wednesday. The president, according to a White House official, also suggested he would be open to more immigrants from Asian countries because he felt that they help the United States economically.\n\nIn addition, the president singled out Haiti, telling lawmakers that immigrants from that country must be left out of any deal, these people said.\n\n\"Why do we need more Haitians?\" Trump said, according to people familiar with the meeting. \"Take them out.\"\n\nIn November, the Trump administration rescinded deportation protection granted to nearly 60,000 Haitians after the 2010 earthquake and told them to return home by July 2019.\n\nLawmakers were taken aback by the comments, according to people familiar with their reactions. Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) had proposed cutting the visa lottery program by 50 percent and then prioritizing countries already in the system, a White House official said.\n\nA White House spokesman defended Trump's position on immigration without directly addressing his remarks. White House officials did not dispute the account.\n\n[200,000 Salvadorans may be forced to leave the U.S. as Trump ends immigration protection]\n\n\"Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people,\" spokesman Raj Shah said in a statement issued after The Washington Post first reported Trump's remarks. \". . . Like other nations that have merit-based immigration, President Trump is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation.\"\n\nTrump built his candidacy and presidency around hard stances on immigration, vowing to build a wall along the Mexican border and cut legal immigration by half, among other positions. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security have increased immigration raids, including dozens this week at convenience stores across the country.\n\nTrump's comments Thursday also put further scrutiny on his long-standing tendency to make racially charged remarks — including attacks on protesting black athletes and his claim that there were fine people \"on both sides\" after neo-Nazis rioted in Charlottesville, Va. Trump falsely claimed for years that Barack Obama was not born in the United States and took out advertisements calling for the death penalty for members of the Central Park Five — four black youths and a Hispanic youth who were accused of a brutal rape in New York and later exonerated.\n\nThe president's remarks were quickly met with scorn from Demo­crats and some Republicans and could throw another wrench into bipartisan discussions on immigration, which had shown promise in recent days, according to legislators.\n\nRep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) said the comments \"will shake the confidence that people have\" in the ongoing immigration policy talks.\n\n\"Democrats and Republicans in the Senate made a proposal. The answer is this racist outburst of the president. How can you take him seriously?\" Gutiérrez said. \"They [Republicans] don't believe in immigration — it's always been about people of color and keeping them out of this country.\"\n\nRep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said on Twitter that Trump's remarks \"are further proof that his Make America Great Again Agenda is really a Make America White Again agenda.\"\n\nSome Republicans also raised objections. Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah), whose family is from Haiti, said in a statement that Trump's remarks were \"unkind, divisive, elitist, and fly in the face of our nation's values. This behavior is unacceptable from the leader of our nation.\"\n\n\"My grandmother used to say, 'Digame con quién caminas, y te diré quién eres.' 'Tell me who you walk with, and I'll tell you who you are,' \" said Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), who represents most of Harlem and is an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. \"If he's walking around with white supremacists and supporting them, this kind of talk doesn't surprise me.\"\n\nThe New York Times also reported last year that Trump said immigrants from Haiti have AIDS. The White House denied that report.\n\n[White House: No deal yet on immigration]\n\nIn a statement condemning Thursday's remarks by Trump, Haiti's ambassador to the United States, Paul G. Altidor, said that \"the president was either misinformed or miseducated about Haiti and its people.\" He said the Haitian Embassy was inundated with emails from Americans apologizing for what the president said.\n\nDemocrats were quick to note that Trump employs Haitians at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and that he praised Haitian Americans during a roundtable in Miami in September.\n\n\"Whether you vote for me or don't vote for me, I really want to be your greatest champion, and I will be your champion,\" Trump said at the roundtable.\n\nAlix Desulme, a city council member in North Miami, home to thousands of Haitian Americans, said the president's latest remarks were \"disgusting.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God. Oh, my God Jesus,\" Desulme said. \"I don't know how much worse it can get.\"\n\n\"This is very alarming. We know he's not presidential, but this is a low,\" he said. \"It's disheartening that someone who is the leader of the free world would use such demeaning language to talk about other folks, referring to folks of color.\"\n\nTrump's critics also said racially incendiary language could damage relationships with foreign allies.\n\nFor many of Trump's supporters, however, the comments may not prove to be particularly damaging. Trump came under fire from conservatives this week for seeming to suggest that he would be open to a comprehensive immigration reform deal without money for a border wall, before he quickly backtracked.\n\n\"He's trying to win me back,\" conservative author Ann Coulter, who has called for harsh limits on immigration, wrote on Twitter.\n\nOutlining a potential bipartisan deal, the lawmakers discussed restoring protections for countries that have been removed from the temporary protected status (TPS) program while committing $1.5 billion for a border wall and making changes to the visa lottery system. Lawmakers mentioned that members of the Congressional Black Caucus had requested that some African countries be included in a deal, according to a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.\n\nThe exchange was \"salty\" on all sides, this person said, with the president growing profane and animated while discussing immigrants from other countries. \"It did not go well,\" this person said.\n\n[Trump wants to remove these immigrants. An ugly bit of history tells us what it could do to the economy.]\n\nThe administration announced this week that it was removing TPS status for citizens of El Salvador. Haitians were added to the TPS program because of a strong earthquake that devastated Haiti eight years ago.\n\nTrump had seemed amenable to a deal earlier in the day during phone calls with lawmakers, aides said, but shifted his position in the meeting and did not seem interested in the bipartisan compromise.\n\nThe scene played out hurriedly in the morning. Graham and Durbin thought they would be meeting with Trump alone and were surprised to find immigration hard-liners such as Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) at the meeting. White House and Capitol Hill aides say Stephen Miller, the president's top immigration official, was concerned there could be a deal proposed that was too liberal and made sure conservative lawmakers were present.\n\nAfter the meeting, Marc Short, Trump's director of legislative affairs, said the White House was nowhere near a bipartisan agreement on immigration.\n\n\"We still think we can get there,\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at the daily White House news briefing.\n\nEd O'Keefe, Maria Sacchetti and Erica Werner contributed to this report.",

        "text": "While Trump’s ‘great, great wall’ has yet to materialize, his administration has quietly built a barrier of bans, roadblocks and bureaucratic burdens\n\nDonald Trump has failed to add another inch to the country’s border wall between the US and Mexico, but his administration this year has quietly erected a steep, invisible wall that limits migration to the US, according to interviews with lawyers and refugee groups.\n\n\n\nSome of these roadblocks received considerable attention, like the three versions of a travel ban on people from Muslim-majority countries and the cancellation of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) – an Obama-era program that protected undocumented youth raised in the US.\n\nBut the Trump administration also appears to have orchestrated a more subtle attack on immigration that touches the most vulnerable populations, like refugees, as well as powerful business people who work in the US.\n\nThis is what the hours after being deported look like Read more\n\n“I think that they’re basically hoping that five years from now we see a significant decrease in the number of people who even want to come,” Sandra Feist, an immigration lawyer in Minnesota, told the Guardian. “I think if we keep this up, that’s what we’ll see.”\n\nFeist, who has worked in immigration law for 16 years and is a part of the American Immigration Lawyers Association media and advocacy committee, said a slew of small administrative changes have drastically slowed the visa process.\n\nThis includes things such as increased scrutiny of the H-1B visa for people in specialty occupations and a new requirement that people seeking employer-sponsored green cards be interviewed. For all visas, immigration lawyers have also seen an increase in challenges, or requests for evidence, from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which oversees immigration.\n\nProfile Who are the Dreamers? Show Hide Dreamers are young immigrants who would qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (Daca) program, enacted under Barack Obama in 2012. Most people in the program entered the US as children and have lived in the US for years “undocumented”. Daca gave them temporary protection from deportation and work permits. Daca was only available to people younger than 31 on 15 June 2012, who arrived in the US before turning 16 and lived there continuously since June 2007. Most Dreamers are from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras and the largest numbers live in California, Texas, Florida and New York. Donald Trump cancelled the program in September but has also said repeatedly he wants Congress to develop a program to “help” the population.\n\nWhen Trump was elected, Feist anticipated Congress would move to change immigration law, but she said she did not expect interference with the administrative process.\n\n“I don’t think I expected them to attack my high-skilled immigration process so aggressively,” Feist said. “I also was not prepared for the ways in which they used the administrative processes so skillfully to create very real hurdles and barriers in ways that didn’t require any changes in the law.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Demonstrators outside the US Capitol during an immigration rally in support of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca). Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nA concern for immigration lawyers is the direction of the USCIS under its new ombudsman, Julie Kirchner, who for 10 years was director of Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that has advocated extreme restrictions on immigration.\n\nThe Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) called for her removal in May. “We do not believe that a person who has spent over a decade attacking immigrant communities will now work effectively and thoughtfully to advance the rights of immigrants and fulfill the important duties that are required of this role,” the CHC said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees USCIS, said it does not comment on congressional correspondence to secretaries.\n\nThe changes at USCIS have hit the key pillars of immigration in the US: employer and family-based, where citizens or a green card holder sponsor a family member’s green card application.\n\n\n\nI also was not prepared for how they used the administrative processes to create very real hurdles and barriers Sandra Feist, immigration lawyer\n\nTrump has said he wants to replace family-based immigration, which he calls chain migration, with a merit-based system. Trump has also called for Congress to terminate the diversity lottery program, which awards 50,000 visas to people vetted by the same process as other visas.\n\n“The lottery system and chain migration – we are going to end them fast. Congress must get involved immediately, and they are involved immediately, and I can tell you we have tremendous support, they will be ended,” Trump said last week.\n\nIn the meantime, programs to help people fleeing natural disasters, violence and persecution have either been cancelled or slowed by bureaucratic hurdles under Trump.\n\nIn July, advocates filed a lawsuit that accused DHS and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of putting asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border in grave danger by threatening, misleading or rejecting them. The agencies do not comment publicly on litigation.\n\nTrump appointees have also dramatically shifted how the federal government speaks about asylum, going as far as to suggest in public communications the unproven claim that asylum is a routinely abused legal loophole.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Trump administration has issued multiple versions of its travel ban, as well as restricting refugee admissions. Photograph: Erik M/Pacific/Barcroft Images\n\n“We also have dirty immigration lawyers who are encouraging their otherwise unlawfully present clients to make false claims of asylum providing them with the magic words needed to trigger the credible fear process,” the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said in October.\n\nUSCIS said it does not have data that shows widespread abuse of the asylum system.\n\nThe Department of Justice, which Session heads, directed the Guardian to five press releases and one news story about immigration fraud. None of these cases demonstrated abuse of the asylum system – though a Bosnian was found to have lied about his involvement in the country’s civil war in order to obtain refugee status.\n\nThree of the fraud schemes were orchestrated fully, or in part, by Americans.\n\nThis year, the administration has also gone after a program that grants temporary status to people affected by events like natural disasters or conflict: Temporary Protected Status (TPS). In November, TPS was terminated for more than 50,000 Haitians and 5,300 Nicaraguans who must leave by 2019 or face deportation. The largest group of (TPS) recipients, Salvadorans who fled their home country after it was struck by earthquakes in 2001, are waiting to hear whether their protection will be extended before it expires in January.\n\n\n\nThe US is losing its reputation as a beacon of safety and offering protection to those who are in danger Hans Van de Weerd, International Rescue Committee\n\nAnd the White House made refugees one if its primary targets a week after Trump took office, when he issued an executive order blocking refugees from entry in the first travel ban. In September, the White House restricted refugee admissions in 2018 to 45,000 people – the lowest ceiling since the president began capping refugee admissions in 1980.\n\nUnlike the smaller administrative changes to immigration processing being made in federal agencies, the travel ban was easily challenged in courts and deemed unconstitutional.\n\nThe supreme court, however, allowed the third version of the travel ban to be enforced this month while it faces multiple legal challenges. This version does not block refugees, but does bar most citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad, Venezuela and North Korea from entering the US.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Maricruz Abarca, of Baltimore, a Daca recipient originally from Mexico, cries during a prayer with other supporters. Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nHans Van de Weerd, vice-president of US programs at the International Rescue Committee (IRC), said US efforts to restrict refugee admissions signals to other countries that it is OK to kick out refugees. “It makes the global challenge of offering protection to refugees so much bigger,” Van de Weerd told the Guardian.\n\nThe Trump administration has also suspended refugee programs such as the Central American Minors program, which allowed parents lawfully in the US to bring their minor children to the country – IRC estimated the program protected nearly 2,700 people last year. And administrative hurdles like expanded security checks and paperwork requirements have put a further burden on an already slow system where cases can take up to 200 days to clear.\n\n'We have plenty of time': Congress may delay decision on fate of 700,000 Dreamers Read more\n\n“The country’s reputation as a beacon of safety and the values of this nation are really about offering protection to those who are in danger,” said Van de Weerd. “The US is losing that reputation.”\n\nDespite the piling of bricks in the virtual wall, Van de Weerd said IRC remained hopeful because the administration’s efforts inspired support for groups that help immigrants and refugees.\n\n“We’ve seen a massive interest from the private sector in resettlement and an increase in private donors,” said Van der Weerd. “We see businesses standing up and saying we want to employ people. We’ve had a hard time managing the huge inflows of volunteers.”\n\nHe wasn’t sure if the energy would turn the tide, but it gave him hope as IRC prepares to push for more resettlements and improve the attitude towards refugees next year. Van der Weed said: “This whole situation has forced people to make clear where they stand.”",

        "text": "Intermarriage in the U.S. 50 Years After Loving v. Virginia\n\nOne-in-six newlyweds are married to someone of a different race or ethnicity\n\nTerminology The term “intermarriage” refers to marriages between a Hispanic and a non-Hispanic, or marriages between non-Hispanic spouses who come from the following different racial groups: white, black, Asian, American Indian, multiracial or some other race. In the racial and ethnic classification system used for this report, individuals are classified first by ethnicity (defined as whether someone is Hispanic or not) and then by race. As such, all references to whites, blacks, Asians, American Indians, multiracial persons or persons of some other race include those who are not Hispanic; Hispanics may be of any race. So, for instance, in the 2015 American Community Survey, 4% of black newlyweds reported that they are also Hispanic. These people are categorized as “Hispanic” in this analysis, and if they are married to someone who identifies as a non-Hispanic black, both are counted as being in an intermarriage. By the same token, if a Hispanic black person marries a non-Hispanic white person, their marriage would be classified as one between a Hispanic and a white person rather than a black and a white person. Beginning with the 2000 census, individuals could choose to identify with more than one group in response to the race question. In this analysis, these multiracial people are treated as a separate race category, different from those who identify as a single race, including those who identify as “some other race.” (As with single race individuals, a multiracial person who also identifies as Hispanic would be classified as Hispanic.) In the secondary data analysis, the term “Asian” includes native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders; “American Indian” includes Alaska natives. In the analysis of the Pew Research Center surveys and the General Social Survey, Asian includes anyone who self-identifies as Asian. “Newlyweds” or people who are “recently married” or “newly married” include those who got married in the 12 months prior to being surveyed for 2008 to 2015 data. In all other years, newlyweds are those who married in that same year. Data analyses for 1967 through 1980 are limited to newlyweds who married for the first time, while analyses for subsequent years include people marrying for the first time and those who have remarried. People born in one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia or who were born abroad to at least one American parent are classified as “U.S. born.” All others are classified as “foreign born,” including those born in Puerto Rico or other United States territories. While these individuals are U.S. citizens by birth, the convention of categorizing persons living in the U.S. who were born in U.S. territories as foreign born has been used by the United Nations. The terms “foreign born” and “immigrant” are used interchangeably. In the analysis of educational attainment, “some college” includes those with an associate degree or those who attended college but did not obtain a degree. “High school or less” includes those who have attained a high school diploma or its equivalent, such as a General Education Development (GED) certificate. “Metro areas” in this report are classified based on metropolitan statistical areas (MSA), which consist of at least one large urban core with 50,000 people or more, as well as neighboring areas that are socially and economically linked to the core area. They are a proxy for urban and suburban areas. For Pew Research Center survey data, references to urban, suburban and rural are based on the respondent’s ZIP code. Urban residents are those who live within the central city of an MSA. Suburban residents are those who live within an MSA county, but are not within the central city. Rural residents are those who do not live in an MSA county.\n\n\n\nIn 2015, 17% of all U.S. newlyweds had a spouse of a different race or ethnicity, marking more than a fivefold increase since 1967, when 3% of newlyweds were intermarried, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. In that year, the U.S. Supreme Court in the Loving v. Virginia case ruled that marriage across racial lines was legal throughout the country. Until this ruling, interracial marriages were forbidden in many states.\n\nMore broadly, one-in-ten married people in 2015 – not just those who recently married – had a spouse of a different race or ethnicity. This translates into 11 million people who were intermarried. The growth in intermarriage has coincided with shifting societal norms as Americans have become more accepting of marriages involving spouses of different races and ethnicities, even within their own families.\n\nThe most dramatic increases in intermarriage have occurred among black newlyweds. Since 1980, the share who married someone of a different race or ethnicity has more than tripled from 5% to 18%. White newlyweds, too, have experienced a rapid increase in intermarriage, with rates rising from 4% to 11%. However, despite this increase, they remain the least likely of all major racial or ethnic groups to marry someone of a different race or ethnicity.\n\nAsian and Hispanic newlyweds are by far the most likely to intermarry in the U.S. About three-in-ten Asian newlyweds (29%) did so in 2015, and the share was 27% among recently married Hispanics. For these groups, intermarriage is even more prevalent among the U.S. born: 39% of U.S.-born Hispanic newlyweds and almost half (46%) of U.S.-born Asian newlyweds have a spouse of a different race or ethnicity.\n\nFor blacks and Asians, stark gender differences in intermarriage\n\nAmong blacks, intermarriage is twice as prevalent for male newlyweds as it is for their female counterparts. While about one-fourth of recently married black men (24%) have a spouse of a different race or ethnicity, this share is 12% among recently married black women.\n\nThere are dramatic gender differences among Asian newlyweds as well, though they run in the opposite direction – Asian women are far more likely to intermarry than their male counterparts. In 2015, just over one-third (36%) of newlywed Asian women had a spouse of a different race or ethnicity, compared with 21% of newlywed Asian men.\n\nIn contrast, among white and Hispanic newlyweds, the shares who intermarry are similar for men and women. Some 12% of recently married white men and 10% of white women have a spouse of a different race or ethnicity, and among Hispanics, 26% of newly married men and 28% of women do.\n\nA more diverse population and shifting attitudes are contributing to the rise of intermarriage\n\nThe rapid increases in intermarriage rates for recently married whites and blacks have played an important role in driving up the overall rate of intermarriage in the U.S. However, the growing share of the population that is Asian or Hispanic, combined with these groups’ high rates of intermarriage, is further boosting U.S. intermarriage overall. Among all newlyweds, the share who are Hispanic has risen by 9 percentage points since 1980, and the share who are Asian has risen 4 points. Meanwhile, the share of newlyweds who are white has dropped by 15 points.\n\nAttitudes about intermarriage are changing as well. In just seven years, the share of adults saying that the growing number of people marrying someone of a different race is good for society has risen 15 points, to 39%, according to a new Pew Research Center survey conducted Feb. 28-March 12, 2017.\n\nThe decline in opposition to intermarriage in the longer term has been even more dramatic, a new Pew Research Center analysis of data from the General Social Survey has found. In 1990, 63% of nonblack adults surveyed said they would be very or somewhat opposed to a close relative marrying a black person; today the figure stands at 14%. Opposition to a close relative entering into an intermarriage with a spouse who is Hispanic or Asian has also declined markedly since 2000, when data regarding those groups first became available. The share of nonwhites saying they would oppose having a family member marry a white person has edged downward as well.\n\nIntermarriage somewhat more common among the college educated\n\nIn 1980, the rate of intermarriage did not differ markedly by educational attainment among newlyweds. Since that time, however, a modest intermarriage gap has emerged. In 2015, 14% of newlyweds with a high school diploma or less were married to someone of a different race or ethnicity, compared with 18% of those with some college and 19% of those with a bachelor’s degree or more.\n\nThe educational gap is most striking among Hispanics: While almost half (46%) of Hispanic newlyweds with a bachelor’s degree were intermarried in 2015, this share drops to 16% for those with a high school diploma or less – a pattern driven partially, but not entirely, by the higher share of immigrants among the less educated. Intermarriage is also slightly more common among black newlyweds with a bachelor’s degree (21%) than those with some college (17%) or a high school diploma or less (15%).\n\nAmong recently married Asians, however, the pattern is different – intermarriage is far more common among those with some college (39%) than those with either more education (29%) or less education (26%). Among white newlyweds, intermarriage rates are similar regardless of educational attainment.\n\nOther key findings",

Instead, they wanted to devise a narrower one that could pass legal muster.\n\nThe president, though, was furious about what he saw as backing down to politically correct adversaries. He did not want a watered-down version of the travel ban, he yelled at Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, as the issue came to a head on Friday, March 3, in the Oval Office.\n\nIt was a familiar moment for Mr. Trump’s advisers. The president did not mind being told “no” in private, and would sometimes relent. But he could not abide a public turnabout, a retreat. At those moments, he often exploded at whoever was nearby.\n\nAs Marine One waited on the South Lawn for Mr. Trump to begin his weekend trip to Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. McGahn insisted that administration lawyers had already promised the court that Mr. Trump would issue a new order. There was no alternative, he said.\n\n“This is bullshit,” the president responded.\n\nWith nothing resolved, Mr. Trump, furious, left the White House. A senior aide emailed a blunt warning to a colleague waiting aboard Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland: “He’s coming in hot.”\n\nAlready mad at Mr. Sessions, who the day before had recused himself in the Russia investigation, Mr. Trump refused to take his calls.

        "text": "Nigeria has the second largest HIV epidemic in the world. Although HIV prevalence among adults is much less (2.8%) than other sub-Saharan African countries such as South Africa (18.8%) and Zambia (11.5%), the size of Nigeria's population means 3.1 million people were living with HIV in 2017. However, a recently published Nigeria HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey (NAIIS), one of the largest population-based HIV/AIDS household surveys ever conducted, found the prevalence to be just 1.4%. The apparent decline has been attributed to better surveillance.\n\nUNAIDS estimated that around two-thirds of new HIV infections in West and Central Africa in 2017 occurred in Nigeria. Together with South Africa and Uganda, the country accounts for around half of all new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa every year. This is despite achieving a 5% reduction in new infections between 2010 and 2017.\n\nUnprotected heterosexual sex accounts for 80% of new HIV infections in Nigeria, with the majority of remaining HIV infections occurring in key affected populations such as sex workers.\n\nSix states in Nigeria account for 41% of people living with HIV, including Kaduna, Akwa Ibom, Benue, Lagos, Oyo, and Kano. HIV prevalence is highest in Nigeria’s southern states (known as the South South Zone), and stands at 5.5%. It is lowest in the southeast (the South East Zone) where there is a prevalence of 1.8%. There are higher rates of HIV in rural areas (4%) than in urban ones (3%).\n\nApproximately 150,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in Nigeria in 2017. Since 2005, the reduction in the number of annual AIDS-related deaths has been minimal, indicative of the fact that only 33% of those with a positive diagnosis in Nigeria are accessing antiretroviral treatment (ART).\n\nNigeria has a mixed epidemic, meaning that while HIV prevalence among the general population is high, certain groups still carry a far greater HIV burden compared to the rest of the population. In Nigeria, Sex workers, men who have sex with men and people who inject drugs make up only 3.4% of the population, yet account for around 32% of new HIV infections.\n\nMen who have sex with men (MSM)\n\nMen who have sex with men are the only group in Nigeria where HIV prevalence is still rising. In 2017, prevalence in this group stood at 23%, significantly more than the next highest prevalence group - sex workers - at 14.4%. Of all new HIV infections in the country, 10% occur among men who have sex with men.\n\nIn 2014, the Nigerian government increased the punishment for homosexuality to 14 years in jail. Anyone ‘assisting couples’ may face up to 10 years in prison. Mass arrests of ‘suspected gay men’ in Nigeria have followed, for example in July 2017 the police arrested 40 men at a private house party.\n\nCriminalising laws such as these have made it harder for civil society organisations to work with LGBT communities and have pushed men who have sex with men underground, making them more vulnerable to HIV. Although the NACA state that ‘no provision of this law will deny anybody in Nigeria access to HIV treatment and other medical services’, studies have shown that since the law came into action, more men who have sex with men report they are afraid to seek healthcare.\n\nWe just need good legal representation for lgbt people in Nigeria, right now, we don’t know who to contact when issues arise, [PrEP]… and antiretroviral drugs are difficult to get, you can’t tell your doctor about your sexuality so getting the right care is difficult, plus stigmatisation of gay and HIV positive people.\n\n– Gay man living in Nigeria\n\nNevertheless recent years have seen an improvement in HIV prevention among men who have sex with men. In 2010, only 18% of men who have sex with men were reached with HIV prevention programming, while recent reports show 82% of men who have sex with men used a condom at last sex with male partner and 97% had tested for HIV in the last 12 months.\n\nHomophobia is widespread in Nigeria. A recent survey found that 87% of respondents would not be willing to accept that a family member was homosexual and only 30% of those polled thought that homosexuals should have access to healthcare. Stigma such as this poses a major barrier to HIV prevention, as research has shown that HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men is directly correlated to their experiences of sexual stigma.\n\nBisi Alimi Foundation Founded by Bisi Alimi, the first man to come out as gay on public television in Nigeria, the foundation advocates for LGBTQ rights, and conducts research into public opinion on LGBTQ issues. In the following video Bisi Ailmi gives an insight into the life of a gay man living with HIV in Nigeria.\n\nSex workers\n\nIn 2016, it was estimated that 14.4% of sex workers were living with HIV in Nigeria. This is a significant drop since 2013 when it was estimated that 24.5% of sex workers were living with HIV. HIV prevalence among sex workers is still eight times higher than the general population.\n\nThere are a number of factors that make sex workers more vulnerable to HIV. HIV prevalence is higher among female sex workers at 24.5% compared to male sex workers at 18.6%. Similarly, brothel-based sex workers face greater HIV risk in Nigeria, with a prevalence of 27.4%.\n\nProgress in HIV prevention meant that, in 2016, 98.1% of sex workers reported using a condom with their last sexual partner and 97.1% of female sex workers had received an HIV test in the last 12 months.\n\nSex work is illegal in Nigeria. The law states that those wholly or partly supporting themselves through sex work can face two years imprisonment. There is no law that prevents healthcare workers from providing sex workers with health services, yet the criminalising law makes it difficult for individuals to disclose that they are sex workers to healthcare workers. The new law also makes sex workers more vulnerable to abuse from law enforcers.\n\nWhen a sex worker’s hideout is raided, the law enforcers collect money from them and when there is no money to offer, they offer them sex. Some of these law enforcers don’t even use condoms and the sex worker don’t have much of a choice at that particular time.\n\n– Ms. Anemo, National Coordinator of Nigerian Sex Workers Association, advocating for decriminalisation of sex work, 2017\n\nPeople who inject drugs (PWID)\n\nHIV prevalence among people who inject drugs (sometimes referred to as PWID) in Nigeria was 3.4% in 2017. Women who inject drugs are particularly affected with a prevalence of 13.9% compared to 2.6% among men. Female sex workers who inject drugs face the highest HIV prevalence at around 43%. It is thought that 9% of new HIV infections in Nigeria every year are among people who inject drugs.\n\nIn 2015, the National Agency for Control of AIDS (NACA) reported that around half (52.7%) of people who inject drugs share needles and syringes. Approximately 7.3% share needles and syringes all the time and more than a third (36.4%) shared needles some of the time. Although this is lower than in 2010, helped in part by efforts to reach people who inject drugs with HIV prevention services, these rates remain very high.\n\nHarm reduction services such as opioid substitution therapy and clean needle exchanges are currently not available in Nigeria. Available services are limited to targeted information, education and communication, condom distribution and hepatitis C treatment. However, discussions on developing a national harm reduction strategy began in 2015.\n\nThe National Strategic Framework identifies providing people who inject drugs with harm reduction and needle exchanges as being a key goal in the coming years.\n\nIn addition to this in 2015 NACA began working with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime on a draft national HIV response strategy to target people who inject drugs. It has also begun to train staff from its National Drug Law Enforcement Agency and 11 civil society organisations working with people who use drugs on HIV responses targeted to this group’s needs.\n\nYoung people\n\nIn 2016, 240,000 adolescents (between the ages of 10-19) were living with HIV, making up 7% of the total number of people with HIV in Nigeria. HIV prevalence among this age group varies regionally, with 4.3% of 15-19 year olds living with HIV in the South South, compared to 1.3% in the South East. Health outcomes for adolescents living with HIV in Nigeria are poor, and Nigeria is the only country in the world where mortality in 10-14 year olds is rising.\n\nYoung women have a higher HIV prevalence and are infected earlier in life than men of the same age group. In 2016, more than 46,000 young women were infected with HIV compared to 33,900 young men.\n\nThere are a number of factors that increase HIV vulnerability among young people, including a lack of knowledge and appropriate sexual reproductive health services. Reports from a 2017 National Health Survey showed that only 29% of women and 27.9% of men between the ages of 15 to 24 could correctly identify ways of preventing sexual transmission of HIV, and reject major myths around transmission. Early sexual debut is common in Nigeria, with 15% of girls and 4% of boys having sex before they are 15 years old. Inter-generational relationships are also common in Nigeria. A 2017 survey found that 41.2% of women between the ages of 15 and 24 had had a sexual partner ten or more years older than them in the last 12 months. This increases HIV risk among this group as often the virus is passed from older men to younger women.\n\nDespite their elevated risk, reports show that few adolescents test for HIV regularly. In 2017 only 2% of males between 15 and 19 and 4% of females had tested for HIV in the last 12 months.\n\nNational targets commit to a 90% treatment coverage and 50% testing rate among young people by 2020.\n\nIn addition to the National Strategic Framework, Nigeria released a National HIV Strategy for Adolescents and Young People in 2016, which provides a set of guidelines co-created with young people. This recognises negative provider attitudes towards young people and their sexual activities, limited access to youth-friendly services, low awareness of HIV and fear of stigma as being key challenges preventing young people from taking up sexual health services.\n\nChildren and orphans\n\nIn 2017, 220,000 children (0 to 14 years) in Nigeria were living with HIV However, only 26% were receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART). The UNAIDS Catch-Up Plan for West and Central Africa, outlines a target to enrol an additional 140,000 children across the region on ART by 2020.\n\nIn 2017, an estimated 1.8 million children were orphaned by AIDS, which can have a huge impact on their health, safety and wellbeing. Around 20% of orphans and vulnerable children do not attend school regularly and around 18% are sexually abused.\n\nHIV also has an indirect impact on children in Nigeria, whereby often they become the caregivers for parents who are living with HIV. Normally, this responsibility lies with girls rather than boys and can contribute to the imbalance in schooling between the two genders in Nigeria, with girls missing out on HIV education that could teach them how to protect themselves from infection.\n\nWomen\n\nIn Nigeria it is estimated that 58% of the people living with HIV are women. Part of the reason why so many more women and girls are affected by HIV is the deep roots that gender inequality has in Nigerian society, culture and law.\n\nIn the most recent rankings, Nigeria was placed 122nd out of 144 for the size of its ‘gender gap’, meaning that it is has one of the most unequal balances of power between men and women in the world.\n\nGender power imbalances mean that women often face barriers in dictating their own sexual partner selection, use of contraception, number and spacing of children, and their own healthcare, all of which put them at greater risk of HIV.\n\nBarriers to land ownership disadvantages women in particular. Although women have land rights, their rights are weaker than men’s. This is not only economically disempowering, but puts pressure on women to give birth to boys, leading to a high fertility rate of 5.5 children per woman. Women who have girls first, are likely to have more children, not use contraceptives, have short periods between pregnancies, and be subjected to polygamy. All of these increase a woman's vulnerability to HIV.\n\nWomen who have been formerly married are also more at risk of HIV, as they face a lack of economic opportunities and high rates of sexual exploitation. HIV prevalence among formerly married women is as high as 5.9% (almost double the prevalence of currently married and never married women – 3.4%). Recent studies have shown that being formerly married can be one of the strongest HIV risk factors among women.\n\nAlthough Nigeria has several strategies on gender equality and HIV, less than 1% of spending on HIV goes towards them. In 2015, the National Agency for the Control of AIDS developed a set of Guidelines to help make gender part of the mainstream HIV response, aiming to raise awareness amongst health practitioners on issues around gender inequality and how to address these issues in their HIV programming. Reducing violence and coercion, and increasing legal protection for women and girls, are particular areas of focus for reducing HIV risk among women and girls.\n\nIn 2016, 34% of adults living with HIV were aware of their status. Across the country testing rates are low: only 15.1% of people between the ages of 15-49 had tested in the last 12 months and knew their results. Nigeria aims to reach the UNAIDS target, with 90% of people living with HIV knowing their status by 2021.\n\nSurveys have also shown that only 60.4% of women and 70.8% of men knew where they could go to be tested for HIV.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why more people are not testing for HIV in Nigeria. These include supply problems with testing kits and logistic issues getting further supplies. There is also a common belief that HTC centres are where HIV-positive people go to access care, rather than them being testing centres for those who don't know their status.\n\nA push on the number of sites providing HTC services has resulted in a huge increase, from around 1,000 in 2010 to more than 8,000 in 2014. However, this number is woefully short of the estimated 23,600 sites needed to provide universal coverage.\n\nTargets set in the most recent National Strategic Framework commit to 60% of the general population and 100% of key populations and children of mothers living with HIV to have access to HIV testing services. The plan also hopes to integrate screening for other co-infections into HIV testing and counselling services.\n\nThe Minister of Health in Nigeria recently released a statement in support of self-testing. Nigeria has put in place policies that allow for self-testing, but these testing kits are not yet available across the country.\n\nNigeria accounted for 59% of all new HIV infections in West and Central Africa in 2016. This rate of new infections has remained relatively stable in recent years, with only a 5% decrease between 2017 and 2010.\n\nThe National Strategic Framework laid out by the NACA, outlined key targets for the next five years: aiming to provide 90% of the general population with HIV prevention interventions by 2021 and for 90% of key populations to be adopting HIV risk reduction behaviours by 2021. They identify strengthening community structures as being a main way to achieve this.\n\nCondom use\n\nAccording to 2017 data, 57.6% of men between the ages of 15-49 reported using a condom when they last had sex, compared to 39.8% of women. Condom use varies across different groups, and is lowest among people who inject drugs at 83.2%.\n\nThe end of term review of the 2010-2015 national HIV strategy identified condom uptake as having been a major area of challenge, identifying cost, low availability and resistance to condom promotion from certain key religious and cultural groups to have been some of the main barriers to progress.\n\nThe review also identified low uptake of lubricants, as having been a key failing, with only 45.9% of participants reporting using lubricants consistently.\n\nThe National Strategic Framework aims to increase condom use, particularly among young people and those who have never been married. It aims for 90% of people to be using condoms regularly by 2021.\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPrEP is not available to the general public in Nigeria, however some serodiscordant couples have been able to access the drug through demonstration projects. In 2016, 242 people were on PrEP in Nigeria. It is hoped that the results of the study will be used to inform a nation-wide scale-up of PrEP as part of a comprehensive HIV-prevention package.\n\nAccording to the new national guidelines for HIV prevention and care, future expansion of PrEP will include serodiscordant couples, commercial sex workers, people who inject drugs, and ‘individuals who engage in anal sex on a prolonged and regular basis’.\n\nHIV education\n\nFamily Life and HIV Education (LLHE) lessons are part of the Nigerian school curriculum. In 2015, more than 48,500 schools were providing LLHE lessons, where they were required to teach a comprehensive list of topics relating to HIV, including basic facts about HIV transmission and prevention, alongside more complex issues such as stigma and gender-based violence. The NSF outlines plans to expand access to this education in the coming years.\n\nPrevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT)\n\nJust over a quarter (26.9%) of all cases of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV in the world happen in Nigeria. In 2016, just 32% of pregnant women living with HIV received antiretroviral treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission and only 34.7% were tested for HIV as part of their antenatal care. As a result the rate of mother-to-child transmission has remained high, at an estimated at 22% in 2016. . Only 18,556 infants born to mothers living with HIV were tested after two months.\n\nAs such, reducing mother-to-child transmission remains a major target area. Nigeria was selected as one of UNAIDS’ 23 priority countries for PMTCT – being one of the nations with the highest HIV burden yet low levels of treatment coverage during pregnancy. Of these 23 countries, Nigeria has the second lowest level of ART coverage in pregnant women.\n\nThe number of pregnant women visiting health facilities remains low, as does the number of health facilities providing PMTCT services, with only 7,265 health facilities providing PMTCT in 2015. To address this, Nigeria aims to have 95% of health facilities providing PMTCT services by 2021.\n\nSMS Communications In early 2015, the telecommunications company Etisalat started rolling out SMS messages to its subscribers about PMTCT and where people could seek HIV services. It is hoped that large-scale communications like this will encourage women to come forward for testing to prevent their babies being born with HIV.\n\nNigeria is a long way off meeting the global target of enrolling 90% of people diagnosed with HIV on antiretroviral treatment (ART). Just 33% of all people living with HIV were receiving treatment in 2017. Among children this is even lower, with just 26% on ART. Of the people on HIV treatment, only 24% had achieved viral suppression in 2016.\n\nPoor treatment coverage and adherence means that the number of AIDS-related deaths in the country has remained high with 150,000 deaths in 2017.\n\nAlthough Nigeria adopted a 'test and treat' policy in 2015, which means that anyone with a positive diagnosis is eligible for treatment, this is far from a reality. Nevertheless, efforts have been made to scale-up treatment access, and 212,000 more people were enrolled on antiretroviral treatment between 2016 and March 2017.\n\nYet weaknesses in the health system exist and create a barrier to many people accessing or staying on treatment. Even when ART can be accessed, drug supplies are known to run out and cause stockouts. In an attempt to address this, the National Strategic Framework for the HIV response has made strengthening supply chains and improving logistics around treatment a priority.\n\nThe UNAIDS catch-up plan for Nigeria, also identifies removing ‘user-fees’ as being a key next step in expanding treatment coverage. Although accessing the antiretroviral drugs themselves is free, often patients will be asked to pay for other services, for example running other tests. Studies have shown that these fees and high costs of travel to clinics can be a barrier to many people accessing care.\n\nNigeria aims to triple treatment coverage in the next three years, ensuring that 90% of the population living with HIV are on treatment by 2021. To do this they will also need to address stigma and discrimination around the virus, and have committed to work to foster an enabling environment for people living with HIV to come forwards.\n\nNigeria was also selected as a key focus country for the World Health Organization’s drug resistance strategy in 2017. Results from 2008, the most recent data available, showed that in some clinics levels of drug resistance mutations had reached 2.1% among new patients and 50% among those who had been exposed to ARVs before.\n\nTreatment coverage during conflict North-Eastern, Borno State has been the centre of Boko Haram’s insurgency in Nigeria over the last decade. Previously a front-runner in antiretroviral treatment coverage, the area has seen ART coverage fall by 18% between 2013 and 2016, with annual drops in the number of people accessing antiretrovirals (ARVs) of 41.2%. Services offering HIV care have become more scarce in the midst of the conflict. The following podcast, discusses some of the difficulties in providing antiretroviral treatment in the midst of ongoing conflict in Nigeria.\n\nRecent research into the role of civil society in the HIV response in Nigeria revealed that while civil society organisations (CSOs) play a key role in service delivery and HIV education, they rarely are given the opportunity to directly impact on policy or play a central role in democratic processes.\n\nAlthough 30% of the organisations included in the study identified advocacy as being a key area of their work, many faced difficulty in getting funding for the more political areas of their work and few had influence beyond their local village and community. CSOs working with men who have sex with men face further difficulties in even registering as an organisation\n\nAlthough NACA claimed to seek civil society input in the formulation of their last National Strategic Framework, there is currently no civil society forum. This was identified by the African Commission as being a key action to further protect and promote the human rights of key groups. One of the actions of this proposed group would be the monitoring of the anti-HIV discrimination and stigma bill.\n\nNigeria has the fourth biggest tuberculosis (TB) epidemic in the world. Approximately 4% of global TB cases occur in Nigeria.\n\nThe TB epidemic in Nigeria is closely linked to HIV. Nigeria is one of ten countries that together are home to 80% of people living with HIV and TB co-infection. Low antiretroviral treatment coverage (30%) contributes to the high rates of HIV-associated TB in the country, as being on antiretroviral treatment dramatically reduces a person living with HIV’s risk of TB.\n\nNigeria also falls behind when it comes to providing preventative TB treatment. It is advised that those living with HIV are enrolled on the TB drug Isoniazid for preventative therapy, yet in Nigeria only 29% of people living with HIV have access to this medicine.\n\nCases of TB are underreported in Nigeria, and the country accounts for 8% of the gap between TB incident cases and notifications. When cases of TB are not reported, active TB is more likely to spread, as more people go untreated. fn]World Health Organisation (2017) ‘Global Tuberculosis Report’[pdf]\n\nBetween 2015 and 2016 cases of multi drug resistant TB increased by 30% in Nigeria. TB can become resistant to drugs when people start treatment, but fail to complete their course or take their medication incorrectly. This is why counselling around TB treatment is so important. In 2016 it was estimated that 4.3% of new cases of TB in Nigeria were resistant to multiple drugs and 25% of previously treated cases.\n\nCultural barriers\n\nThe national strategic framework identifies certain cultural practices that increase HIV vulnerability among the general population in Nigeria. These include female genital mutilation (FGM), denial of women's access to inheritance, widowhood rites, encouragement of multiple sexual partners for males, and marriage of young girls to much older men.\n\nIn addition to these stigma remains a key barrier to the HIV response in Nigeria, with 46.8% of people reporting that they would not buy vegetables from a shopkeeper living with HIV, in 2016. As such reducing stigma and discrimination has been identified as being a key action point for the country in the West and Central Africa catch-up plan.\n\nLegal barriers\n\nIn early 2015, President Jonathan signed a new antidiscrimination bill into law which secured the rights of people living with HIV, protecting HIV-positive employees from unfair dismissal and from mandatory HIV testing. However, in 2016 UNAIDS reported that 21% of people living with HIV had been denied access to health services and reproductive health services due to their status.\n\nOne of the major barriers to accessing HIV prevention programmes for men who have sex with men are laws that criminalise their activities. For example, same-sex relations in Nigeria can be punished with 14 years imprisonment. This is not only limiting access to HIV prevention programming for this community, but causing nationwide stigma and discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation.\n\nStructural barriers\n\nA simple lack of sites that deliver HIV services (testing sites, PMTCT sites, and treatment sites) presents problems for the Nigerian population. In 2015 there were only 1,078 facilities providing HIV treatment, according to the national strategic framework.\n\nAlthough rates are low (0.5% and 1.2% of new HIV infections in 2010 respectively) blood transfusions and unsafe medical injections do result in some new cases of HIV. As a result, enhanced efforts could almost eliminate this risk. Although there are guidelines for certain practices, the lack of universal precautions and failure to record blood safety information in all circumstances means this transmission route remains. By 2021, the NACA aims to ensure that 100% of blood transfusions and blood products are safe.\n\nDespite an additional US$17 million of domestic funds having been allocated to the HIV response for 2017, the vast majority of funding still comes from international donors.\n\nTo increase domestic funding further, Nigeria has launched a new initiative to make each of the 36 states contribute up to 1% of their monthly allocations from the federal government to the HIV response. Nigeria also aims to increase private sector investment in the response from 2.1% in 2014 to 10% in 2018.\n\nFunding problems arose in 2016 following an audit of NACA by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis. The audit found evidence of “fraud and collusion in the amount of US$3.8 million”, causing the Global Fund to suspend its funds. However, the Global Fund has reinstated its support following the creation of the West and Central Africa Catch up Plan, which saw the fund commit to providing another US$214 million to cover an additional 215,000 treatments.\n\nNigeria is working hard to reverse the trend of a donor-driven approach to our national HIV programmes, as more financial resources are being allocated for the procurement of medicines.\n\n- Isaac Adewolfe, Federal Minister of Health, Nigeria\n\nNigeria is an enormous, populous country, and so it has a very high number of people living with HIV despite a relatively low HIV prevalence.\n\nProviding antiretroviral treatment for all people living with HIV not only benefits those already living with HIV, it also dramatically reduces the chance of onwards HIV transmission to others. In a country such as Nigeria, where so many people are not on treatment, it is hard to tackle the HIV epidemic. Considerable commitment, funding and resources need to be mobilised to expand access to treatment as a prevention method.\n\nDespite government commitment to the HIV response, punitive laws such as the 2014 anti-homosexuality bill damage progress. Indeed, a worrying rise in HIV prevalence is emerging among men who have sex with men just as punishments for homosexual acts increase, suggesting this group is finding it more and more difficult to access HIV services. Engaging all members of society, especially those who are most vulnerable to HIV, is key to a unified and considered HIV response.\n\nFinally, encouraging HIV testing among the Nigerian population to ensure everyone knows their HIV status is key to any informed strategic plan. Without knowing the extent of how many people are living with HIV it is hard to mitigate new infections and provide HIV treatment to all.",

Approximately 36.9 million people are currently living with HIV, and tens of millions of people have died of AIDS-related causes since the beginning of the epidemic.\n\nMany people living with HIV or at risk for HIV infection do not have access to prevention, treatment, and care, and there is still no cure.\n\nIn recent decades, major global efforts have been mounted to address the epidemic, and despite challenges, significant progress has been made.\n\nUnder Sustainable Development Goal 3, the global community has agreed to aim to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030, and under the UNAIDS “90-90-90” targets, countries work toward achieving, by 2020, “90% of people living with HIV knowing their HIV status; 90% of people who know their HIV-positive status on treatment; and 90% of people on treatment with suppressed viral loads.”\n\nThe U.S. government (U.S.) is the single largest donor to international HIV efforts in the world, including the largest donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund), and supports the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which is an interagency initiative launched in 2003 as the U.S. government’s effort to combat HIV around the world.\n\nGlobal Response\n\nHIV, the virus that causes AIDS (see box), has become one of the world’s most serious health and development challenges since the first cases were reported in 1981. Approximately 77 million people have become infected with HIV since the start of the epidemic. Today, there are approximately 36.9 million people currently living with HIV, and tens of millions of people have died of AIDS-related causes since the beginning of the epidemic.\n\nHIV: A virus that is transmitted through certain body fluids and weakens the immune system by destroying cells that fight disease and infection, specifically CD4 cells (often called T cells). Left untreated, HIV reduces the number of CD4 cells in the body, making it more difficult for the immune system to fight off infections and other diseases. HIV can lead to the development of AIDS, “acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.”\n\nOver the past two decades, in particular, major global efforts have been mounted to address the epidemic, and significant progress has been made. The number of people newly infected with HIV, especially children, and the number of AIDS-related deaths have declined over the years, and the number of people with HIV receiving treatment increased to 21.7 million in 2017.\n\nStill, remaining challenges continue to complicate HIV control efforts. Many people living with HIV or at risk for HIV infection do not have access to prevention, treatment, and care, and there is still no cure. HIV primarily affects those in their most productive years, and it not only affects the health of individuals, but also impacts households, communities, and the development and economic growth of nations. Many of the countries hardest hit by HIV also face serious challenges due to other infectious diseases, food insecurity, and additional global health and development problems.\n\nLatest Estimates\n\nGlobal prevalence among adults (the percent of people ages 15-49 who are infected) has leveled since 2001 and was 0.8% in 2017 (see Figure 1).\n\nin 2017 (see Figure 1). There were 36.9 million people living with HIV in 2017 (see Table 1 ), up from 32.4 million in 2010, the result of continuing new infections and people living longer with HIV.\n\npeople living with HIV in 2017 (see Table 1 ), up from 32.4 million in 2010, the result of continuing new infections and people living longer with HIV. Although HIV testing capacity has increased over time, enabling more people to learn their HIV status, about one in four people with HIV are still unaware they are infected.\n\npeople with HIV are still unaware they are infected. While there have been significant declines in new infections since the mid-1990s, there were still about 1.8 million new infections in 2017, or about 5,000 new infections per day. Recent data shows that the pace of decline in new infections is too slow to reach global targets. Furthermore, the pace of decline varies by age group, sex, and region.\n\nnew infections in 2017, or about 5,000 new infections per day. Recent data shows that the pace of decline in new infections is too slow to reach global targets. Furthermore, the pace of decline varies by age group, sex, and region. HIV remains a leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause of death globally among women of reproductive age. However, deaths have declined, due in part to antiretroviral treatment (ART) scale-up. 940,000 people died of AIDS in 2017, a 33% decrease from 1.4 million in 2010 and a 51% decrease from the peak of 1.9 million in 2004.\n\nTable 1: Snapshot of Global Epidemic Today, by Region Region % of Adults\n\nLiving with HIV\n\n(Adult Prevalence) # of People\n\nLiving with HIV\n\n(% of Global Total) # of People\n\nNewly Infected\n\nwith HIV # of\n\nAIDS-Related\n\nDeaths Global, Total 0.8% 36.9 million (100%) 1.8 million 940,000 Eastern and Southern Africa 6.8% 19.6 million (53%) 800,000 380,000 Western and Central Africa 1.9% 6.1 million (17%) 370,000 280,000 Asia and the Pacific 0.2% 5.2 million (14%) 280,000 170,000 Western and Central Europe and North America 0.3% 2.2 million (6%) 70,000 13,000 Latin America 0.5% 1.8 million (5%) 100,000 37,000 Eastern Europe and Central Asia 0.8% 1.4 million (4%) 130,000 34,000 The Caribbean 1.2% 310,000 (<1%) 15,000 10,000 Middle East and North Africa <0.1% 220,000 (<1%) 18,000 9,800 NOTES: Reflects 2017 data.\n\nAffected Areas\n\nSub-Saharan Africa , with more than two-thirds of all people living with HIV globally, is the hardest hit region in the world, followed by Asia and the Pacific (see Table 1). The Caribbean as well as Eastern Europe and Central Asia are also heavily affected.\n\nEastern and Southern Africa. Eastern and Southern Africa are home to more than half (53%) of all people living with HIV, as well as two-thirds of children living with HIV (67%). Despite the significant impact, new infections in the region have declined by 30% since 2010. Almost all of the region’s nations have generalized HIV epidemics – that is, their national HIV prevalence is greater than 1%.

The Caribbean. An estimated 310,000 people are living with HIV in the Caribbean. The number of people living with HIV on treatment more than doubled since 2010 (from 69,000 in 2010 to approximately 181,000 in 2017). However, the percentage of people living with HIV who have suppressed viral loads in the region (40%) is below the global average (47%).\n\nAn estimated 310,000 people are living with HIV in the Caribbean.

However, the percentage of people living with HIV who have suppressed viral loads in the region (40%) is below the global average (47%). Middle East and North Africa. An estimated 220,000 people are living with HIV in the Middle East and North Africa. Treatment coverage among people living with HIV in this region is 29%, the lowest of any region. Criminalization of key populations and stigma serve as barriers to coverage in the region. The region is also one of two in the world where the number of AIDS-related deaths is increasing (the other is Eastern Europe and Central Asia); the number of AIDS-related deaths increased by 11% since 2010.\n\nAffected/Vulnerable Populations\n\nMost HIV infections are transmitted heterosexually, although risk factors vary. In some countries, men who have sex with men, injecting drug users, sex workers, transgender people, and prisoners are disproportionally affected by HIV.\n\nWomen represent almost half (49%) of all adults living with HIV worldwide, and HIV (along with complications related to pregnancy) is the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age. Gender inequalities, differential access to service, and sexual violence increase women’s vulnerability to HIV, and women, especially younger women, are biologically more susceptible to HIV.\n\nYoung people, ages 15-24, account for approximately a third of new HIV infections, and in some areas, young women are disproportionally impacted. In sub-Saharan Africa, young women 15-24 account for a quarter of all new HIV infections in the region in 2017, even though they represent only 10% of the population.\n\nGlobally, there were 1.8 million children living with HIV, 110,000 AIDS-related deaths, and 180,000 new infections among children in 2017. Since 2010, new HIV infections among children have declined by 35%.\n\nHIV & TB\n\nHIV has led to a resurgence of tuberculosis (TB), particularly in Africa, and TB is a leading cause of death for people with HIV worldwide. In 2017, approximately 9% of new TB cases occurred in people living with HIV. However, between 2000 and 2017, TB deaths in people living with HIV declined substantially, largely due to the scale up of joint HIV/TB services. See the KFF fact sheet on TB.\n\nPrevention and Treatment\n\nNumerous prevention interventions exist to combat HIV, and new tools such as vaccines, are currently being researched.\n\nEffective prevention strategies include behavior change programs, condoms, HIV testing, blood supply safety, harm reduction efforts for injecting drug users, and male circumcision.\n\nAdditionally, recent research has shown that engagement in HIV treatment not only improves individual health outcomes but also significantly reduces the risk of transmission (referred to as “treatment as prevention” or TasP). Those with undetectable viral loads (known as being virally suppressed) have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV sexually.\n\nPre-exposure antiretroviral prophylaxis (PrEP) has also been shown to be an effective HIV prevention strategy in individuals at high risk for HIV infection. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended PrEP as a form of prevention for high-risk individuals in combination with other prevention methods. Further, in 2016, the U.N. Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS stated PrEP research and development should be accelerated.\n\nExperts recommend that prevention be based on “knowing your epidemic” (tailoring prevention to the local context and epidemiology), using a combination of prevention strategies, bringing programs to scale, and sustaining efforts over time. Access to prevention, however, remains limited, and there have been renewed calls for the strengthening of prevention efforts.\n\nHIV treatment includes the use of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) to attack the virus itself, and medications to prevent and treat the many opportunistic infections that can occur when the immune system is compromised by HIV. In light of recent research findings, WHO released a guideline in 2015 recommending starting HIV treatment earlier in the course of illness.\n\nCombination ART, first introduced in 1996, has led to dramatic reductions in morbidity and mortality, and access has increased in recent years, rising to nearly 22 million people (59% of people living with HIV) in 2017.\n\nThe percentage of pregnant women receiving ART for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV increased to 80% in 2017, up from 47% in 2010.\n\nAccess to ART among children has also risen significantly, from 17% in 2010 to 52% in 2017.\n\nApproximately 47% of all people living with HIV are virally suppressed, which means they are likely healthier and less likely to transmit the virus. Viral suppression varies greatly by region, key population, and sex.\n\nGlobal Goals\n\nInternational efforts to combat HIV began in the first decade of the epidemic with the creation of the WHO’s Global Programme on AIDS in 1987. Over time, new initiatives and financing mechanisms have helped increase attention to HIV and contributed to efforts to achieve global goals; these include:\n\nthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) , which was formed in 1996 to serve as the U.N. system’s coordinating body and to help galvanize worldwide attention to HIV/AIDS; and\n\n, which was formed in 1996 to serve as the U.N. system’s coordinating body and to help galvanize worldwide attention to HIV/AIDS; and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund), which was established in 2001 by a U.N. General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on HIV/AIDS as an independent, international financing institution that provides grants to countries to address HIV, TB, and malaria (see the KFF fact sheet on the Global Fund).\n\nThe contributions of affected country governments and civil society have also been critical to the response. These and other efforts work toward achieving major global HIV/AIDS goals that have been set through:\n\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Adopted in 2015, the SDGs aim to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030 under SDG Goal 3, which is to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.” The SDGs are the successor to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which included an HIV target under MDG 6: to halt and begin to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015 and achieve universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS by 2010. As of 2015, the AIDS-related targets of MDGs were met.\n\nAdopted in 2015, the SDGs aim to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030 under SDG Goal 3, which is to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.” The SDGs are the successor to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which included an HIV target under MDG 6: to halt and begin to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015 and achieve universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS by 2010. As of 2015, the AIDS-related targets of MDGs were met. UNAID’s “90-90-90” targets. On World AIDS Day 2014, UNAIDS set the “90-90-90” targets for 2020 aimed at ending the epidemic by 2030. The targets include achieving “90% of people living with HIV knowing their HIV status; 90% of people who know their HIV-positive status on treatment; and 90% of people on treatment with suppressed viral loads.” These goals and targets were reiterated in the UNAIDS 2016-2021 Strategy, which also aligns with the SDGs. As of 2017, 75% of people living with HIV knew their status; among those who knew their status, 79% were accessing treatment; among those accessing treatment, 81% were virally suppressed.\n\nMore recently, at the June 2016 U.N. General Assembly High-Level Meeting on Ending AIDS, world leaders adopted a new Political Declaration that reaffirmed commitments and called for an intensification of efforts to end AIDS by 2030. In 2017, a report of the U.N. Secretary-General emphasized these commitments, calling for the global community to reinvigorate global efforts to respond to AIDS.\n\nGlobal Resources\n\nUNAIDS estimates that $21.3 billion was available to address HIV in low- and middle-income countries in 2017. Of this, much funding to address HIV in low- and middle-income countries came from major donor governments, which disbursed $8.1 billion in 2017; the U.S. was the largest donor, followed by the U.K. and France. Donor government funding in 2017 increased after two years of declines, however, this increase was largely due to the timing of U.S. funding and is not expected to continue. Other governments and organizations also contribute substantially to funding the global response, including:\n\nhard-hit countries, which have also provided resources to address their epidemics;\n\nthe Global Fund, which has committed approximately $20 billion for HIV efforts in more than 100 countries to date; and\n\nthe private sector, including foundations and corporations, which also plays a major role (the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, for one, has committed more than $3 billion in HIV grants to organizations addressing the epidemic, as well as provided additional funding to the Global Fund).\n\nLooking ahead, UNAIDS estimates $26.2 billion will be needed annually by 2020 to meet global targets to end AIDS as a global public health threat by 2030.\n\nU.S. Government Efforts\n\nThe U.S. government (U.S.) has been involved in HIV efforts since the 1980s and, today, is the single largest donor to international HIV efforts in the world, including the largest donor to the Global Fund. The U.S. first provided funding to address the global HIV epidemic in 1986. U.S. efforts and funding increased slowly over time through targeted initiatives to address HIV in certain countries in Africa, South Asia, and the Caribbean, but they intensified with the 2003 launch of the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which brought significant new attention and funding to address the global HIV epidemic, as well as TB and malaria.\n\nPEPFAR\n\nCreated in 2003, PEPFAR is the U.S. government’s global effort to combat HIV. As an interagency initiative, PEPFAR involves multiple U.S. departments, agencies, and programs that address the global epidemic, and it is carried out in close coordination with host country governments and other organizations, including multilateral organizations such as the Global Fund and UNAIDS. Collectively, U.S. bilateral activities span more than 50 countries, including countries reached through regional programs in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and the Caribbean, with U.S. support for multilateral efforts reaching additional countries. To date, PEPFAR funding, which includes all bilateral funding for HIV as well as U.S. contributions to the Global Fund and UNAIDS, has totaled more than $80 billion.\n\nFor FY 2018, Congress appropriated $5.2 billion for bilateral HIV and $1.35 billion for the Global Fund, totaling $6.6 billion. For FY 2019, the current Administration has requested $4.3 billion for bilateral HIV and $925 million for the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund, a significant decrease from prior years’ levels.\n\nFor more information, see the KFF fact sheets on PEPFAR, the U.S. Global Health Budget: HIV/PEPFAR (bilateral funding), the U.S. Global Health Budget: Global Fund, and trends in U.S. federal funding for HIV/AIDS.",

        "text": "\n\nLeading up to World AIDS Day, the ONE Campaign released a damning report on the potential impact of the White House's proposed $800 million cut to HIV/AIDS efforts that experts predicts could result in millions of new HIV infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths, reversing progress the world has made in the fight against AIDS.\n\n\"The FY 2018 budget proposal would have led to the first global increase in new HIV infections since 1995, with nearly 200,000 additional HIV infections in the first year,\" the report, entitled \"Red Ribbon or White Flag, The future of the U.S. Global AIDS Response,\" reads.\n\n\"If these cuts were maintained, nearly 600,000 additional people could be infected by 2020, dragging the world back to levels of new infections last seen in 2011.\"\n\nThe President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) announced earlier this summer that four African countries are closing in on controlling their HIV/AIDS as a result of U.S. investment. However, the good news was overshadowed by concerns over President Donald Trump's 2018 budget proposal which slashes PEPFAR by 17 percent and overall, guts global health programs by $2 billion, a move that AIDS experts and advocates predict will upend progress on curbing the epidemic.\n\n\"New estimates have found that the 17 percent cut of $800 million to U.S. bilateral AIDS spending included in President Trump's FY2018 budget proposal would lead to over 4 million deaths and 26 million new HIV infections in sub Saharan Africa over the next 15 years,\"the report states. \"That works out to more than 790 deaths and 4,800 new infections every day in the hardest-hit region.\"\n\nONE Global is an international non-profit that combats poverty and preventable disease around the world but particularly in Africa. Their report is critical of the PEPFAR strategy released by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in September, which focuses on 13 high-burden countries with the potential to achieve epidemic control by 2020.\n\nBut the plan, aimed at reducing future costs, reduces investment in South Africa, India and Mozambique — countries with some of the world highest HIV/AIDS rates in the world.The strategy also eliminates funding for seven countries that have historically partnered with PEPFAR and reduces funding for 17 other countries.\n\nDespite the cuts, Mr. Trump has name-checked the work of PEPFAR, mentioning the program during his United National General Assembly speech in September, as has Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Ambassador Deborah Birx, the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy, has taken Mr. Tillerson's \"do more with less\" mantra to heart, telling CBS News in July that PEPFAR's programs needed more scrutiny.\n\n\"Can we draw a straight line from taxpayers in Iowa from the countries and individuals we are serving?\" she said.\n\nThe proposed cuts go further than PEPFAR though — Mr. Trump has also proposed to cut contribution to to PEPFAR's international partner, The Global Fund, by 17 percent, which in turn, is likely to depress commitments from other donor countries.\n\n\"Slowing U.S. efforts to fight HIV/AIDS for three years could set the global response back nine years and squander much of the $64 billion that the U.S. has invested over that time,\" the report says.",

        "text": "Within Mr. Trump’s inner circle, Mr. Flynn appears to have been the primary interlocutor with the Russian envoy. The two were in contact during the campaign and the transition, Mr. Kislyak and current and former American officials have said. But Mr. Sessions served as the chairman of Mr. Trump’s national security committee — a post Democrats said would have made him a much sought-after figure for officials from many foreign countries.\n\nThere is nothing unusual about meetings between presidential campaigns and foreign diplomats. Mr. Kislyak was one of several envoys at the Republican National Convention, where his first meeting with Mr. Sessions, according to the attorney general, was a brief encounter after a panel organized by the Heritage Foundation. Ambassadors also attended the Democratic convention, though it was not clear whether Mr. Kislyak was among them.\n\n“Active embassies here consider it as their assignment to stretch out feelers to presidential hopefuls,” said Peter Wittig, the German ambassador, who met most of the Republican candidates, though not Mr. Trump. “I don’t consider it as something unusual or problematic.”\n\nThe trouble in Mr. Sessions’s case is that his meeting came as the nation’s intelligence agencies were concluding that Russia had tried to destabilize the election and help Mr. Trump. Mr. Sessions’s initial lack of disclosure of the meetings with Mr. Kislyak fed suspicions that it was more than run-of-the-mill diplomacy.\n\nThe disclosure, first reported by The Washington Post, contradicted forceful and repeated denials from the White House that anyone from the Trump campaign had discussions with the Russians. “I have nothing to do with Russia,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Feb. 20. “To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.”",

        "text": "- WASHINGTON (AP) — In bluntly vulgar language, President Donald Trump questioned Thursday why the U.S. would accept more immigrants from Haiti and \"shithole countries\" in Africa rather than places like Norway, as he rejected a bipartisan immigration deal, according to people briefed on the extraordinary Oval Office conversation.\n\nTrump's contemptuous description of an entire continent startled lawmakers in the meeting and immediately revived charges that the president is racist. The White House did not deny his remark but issued a statement saying Trump supports immigration policies that welcome \"those who can contribute to our society.\"\n\nTrump's comments came as two senators presented details of a bipartisan compromise that would extend protections against deportation for hundreds of thousands of young immigrants — and also strengthen border protections as Trump has insisted.\n\nThe lawmakers had hoped Trump would back their accord, an agreement among six senators evenly split among Republicans and Democrats, ending a months-long, bitter dispute over protecting the \"Dreamers.\" But the White House later rejected it, plunging the issue back into uncertainty just eight days before a deadline that threatens a government shutdown.\n\nDick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate' s No. 2 Democrat, explained that as part of that deal, a lottery for visas that has benefited people from Africa and other nations would be ended, the sources said, though there could be another way for them to apply. Durbin said people would be allowed to stay in the U.S. who fled here after disasters hit their homes in places including El Salvador, Guatemala and Haiti.\n\nTrump specifically questioned why the U.S. would want to admit more people from Haiti. As for Africa, he asked why more people from \"shithole countries\" should be allowed into the U.S., the sources said.\n\nThe president suggested that instead, the U.S. should allow more entrants from countries like Norway. Trump met this week with Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg.\n\nAsked about the remarks, White House spokesman Raj Shah did not deny them.\n\n\"Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people,\" he said.\n\nTrump's remarks were remarkable even by the standards of a president who has been accused by his foes of racist attitudes and has routinely smashed through public decorum that his modern predecessors have generally embraced.\n\nTrump has claimed without evidence that Barack Obama, the nation's first black president, wasn't born in the United States, has said Mexican immigrants were \"bringing crime\" and were \"rapists\" and said there were \"very fine people on both sides\" after violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, left one counter-protester dead.\n\n\"Racist,\" tweeted Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., after Thursday's story broke. But it wasn't just Democrats objecting.\n\nRepublican Rep. Mia Love of Utah, the daughter of Haitian immigrants, said Trump's comments were \"unkind, divisive, elitist and fly in the face of our nation's values.\" She said, \"This behavior is unacceptable from the leader of our nation\" and Trump must apologize to the American people \"and the nations he so wantonly maligned.\"\n\nTrump has called himself the \"least racist person that you've ever met.\"\n\nCritics also have questioned his mental fitness to serve as president, citing his inability to muster some policy details and his tweets asserting his \"nuclear button\" is bigger than North Korea's. He responded to such criticism with a recent tweet calling himself \"a very stable genius\" who is \"like, really smart.\"\n\nThe sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly describe the conversation. One said lawmakers in the room were taken aback by Trump's remarks.\n\nThe Trump administration announced late last year that it would end a temporary residency permit program that allowed nearly 60,000 citizens from Haiti to live and work in the United States following a devastating 2010 earthquake.\n\nTrump has spoken positively about Haitians in public. During a 2016 campaign event in Miami, he said \"the Haitian people deserve better\" and told the audience of Haitian-Americans he wanted to \"be your greatest champion, and I will be your champion.\"\n\nThe agreement that Durbin and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., described to Trump also includes his $1.6 billion request for a first installment on his long-sought border wall, aides familiar with the agreement said. They required anonymity because the agreement is not yet public.\n\nTrump's request covers 74 miles of border wall as part of a 10-year, $18 billion proposal.\n\nDemocrats had long vowed they wouldn't fund the wall but are accepting the opening request as part of a broader plan that protects from deportation about 800,000 younger immigrants brought to the country as children and now here illegally.\n\nThe deal also would include restrictions on a program allowing immigrants to bring some relatives to the U.S.\n\nIn an afternoon of drama and confusing developments, four other GOP lawmakers — including hardliners on immigration — were also in Trump's office for Thursday's meeting, a development sources said Durbin and Graham did not expect. It was unclear why the four Republicans were there, and the session did not produce the results the two senators were hoping for.\n\n\"There has not been a deal reached yet,\" said White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But she added, \"We feel like we're close.\"\n\nUnderscoring the hurdles facing the effort, other Republicans also undercut the significance of the deal the half-dozen senators hoped to sell to Trump.\n\n\"How do six people bind the other 94 in the Senate? I don't get that,\" said No. 2 Senate Republican John Cornyn of Texas.\n\nCornyn said the six lawmakers were hoping for a deal and \"everyone would fall in line. The president made it clear to me on the phone less than an hour ago that he wasn't going to do that.\"\n\nThe six senators have been meeting for months to find a way to revive protections for young immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children and are here illegally. Trump ended the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program last year but has given Congress until March 5 to find a way to keep it alive.\n\nFederal agencies will run out of money and have to shut down if lawmakers don't pass legislation extending their financing by Jan. 19. Some Democrats are threatening to withhold their votes — which Republicans will need to push that legislation through Congress — unless an immigration accord is reached.\n\nCornyn said the real work for a bipartisan immigration deal will be achieved by a group of four leading lawmakers — the No. 2 Republicans and Democrats in both the House and Senate. That group met for the first time this week.\n\nThe immigration effort seemed to receive a boost Tuesday when Trump met with two dozen lawmakers and agreed to seek a bipartisan way to resuscitate the program. The group agreed to also include provisions strengthening security — which for Trump means building parts of a wall along the border with Mexico — curbing immigrants' relatives from coming here and restricting the visa lottery.\n\nAlso in Thursday's Oval Office meeting were House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and GOP Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia. Aides to lawmakers who attended declined to provide comment on Trump's remarks.\n\nAny immigration deal would face hurdles winning congressional approval.\n\nMany Democrats would oppose providing substantial sums for Trump's campaign promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico. Many Hispanic and liberal members of the party oppose steps toward curtailing immigration such as ending the visa lottery and restricting the relatives that legal immigrants could bring to the U.S.\n\nAmong Republicans, some conservatives are insisting on going further than the steps that Trump has suggested. They want to reduce legal immigration, require employers to verify workers' citizenship and block federal grants to so-called sanctuary cities that hinder federal anti-immigrant efforts.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin, Andrew Taylor, Kevin Freking and Matthew Daly contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Asked if he would publicly reject the support of former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said, “I just don’t know anything about him.” That’s nonsense:\n\nDuke ran for governor of Louisiana in 1991 as a Republican, and Trump said at the time that President George H.W. Bush was right “to come out against” Duke’s campaign. Duke lost but he won a majority of the white vote — which Trump found troubling. “I hate seeing what it represents,” Trump said, referring to what he called the “anger vote.”\n\nIn 2000, Trump considered running for the Reform Party presidential nomination but did not run because he said he did not want to be associated with Pat Buchanan, who had left the Republican Party to seek the Reform Party nomination, and David Duke, who supported Buchanan. Trump at the time called Duke “a bigot, a racist, a problem.”\n\nFor several days, Trump has had trouble handling questions about Duke, ever since Duke said on his radio show Feb. 24 that “voting against Donald Trump at this point is really treason to your heritage.” BuzzFeed on Feb. 25 reported Duke’s statement of support.\n\nDuke ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for U.S. Senate in 1990 and governor of Louisiana in 1991. In a Nov. 10, 1991, story on Duke’s gubernatorial campaign, the New York Times described Duke as “an open white supremacist and anti-Semite for most of his adult life, who sold Nazi literature from his legislative office in 1989.” The Southern Poverty Law Center on its website refers to Duke as the “most recognizable figure of the American radical right, a neo-Nazi, longtime Klan leader and now international spokesman for Holocaust denial.”\n\nOn Feb. 26, Trump held a press conference to announce the endorsement of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. With Christie at his side, Trump was asked how he felt about receiving Duke’s support. “I didn’t even know he endorsed me,” Trump said, clearly irritated by the question. “David Duke endorsed me? OK. Alright. I disavow. OK?”\n\nTrump was again asked about Duke in a Feb. 28 interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” by anchor Jake Tapper.\n\nTapper, Feb. 28: I want to ask you about the Anti-Defamation League, which this week called on you to publicly condemn unequivocally the racism of former KKK grand wizard David Duke, who recently said that voting against you at this point would be treason to your heritage. Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don’t want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election? Trump: Well, just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke. OK? I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don’t know.\n\nTrump went on to say that he did not want to condemn any groups until he knew something about them. He told Tapper to “give me a list of the groups” and he would review them. But Tapper returned to Duke.\n\nTapper: OK. I mean, I’m just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but… Trump: I don’t know any — honestly, I don’t know David Duke. I don’t believe I have ever met him. I’m pretty sure I didn’t meet him. And I just don’t know anything about him.\n\nTrump should be well aware of Duke — especially since Trump once said he decided not to run for president in 2000 in part because of David Duke and his politics.\n\nIn 2000, Trump was considering running for the Reform Party nomination. The party had gained a significant following in 1992, when Texas billionaire Ross Perot captured nearly 19 percent of the presidential vote. Perot ran again in 1996, but he won only 8.4 percent of the vote.\n\nBut by February 2000, the Reform Party went from decline to disaster. One of the party’s leading figures — Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura — announced that he was leaving the party, citing the possibility that Pat Buchanan would be the party’s presidential nominee and Duke’s support for Buchanan’s nomination. At the time, Ventura explained his decision in an interview on CNN.\n\nVentura, Feb. 11, 2000: I can’t stay within a national party that, you know, that could well have Pat Buchanan as its presidential nominee. And now the latest word, I hear he’s getting support from David Duke. Well, I can’t be part of that.\n\nThree days later, Ventura appeared again on CNN and said that he “encouraged Donald Trump not to seek their presidential nomination, and he concurred with that and he’s not going to do that now.” That same day, Trump announced he would not seek the Reform Party nomination during an interview with Matt Lauer on NBC’s “Today Show.” Trump told Lauer the party was “self-destructing.”\n\nLauer, Feb. 14, 2000: When you say the party is self-destructing, what do you see as the biggest problem with the Reform Party right now? Trump: Well, you’ve got David Duke just joined — a bigot, a racist, a problem. I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party. Buchanan’s a disaster as we’ve, you know, covered. Jesse’s a terrific guy who just left the party. And he, you know, it’s unfortunate, but he just left the party. He’s going to be doing his Independence Party from Minnesota.\n\nTrump also put out a statement that day, according to the New York Times, that referred to Duke as “a Klansman.”\n\nNew York Times, Feb. 14, 2000: Mr. Trump painted a fairly dark picture of the Reform Party in his statement, noting the role of Mr. Buchanan, along with the roles of David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, and Lenora Fulani, the former standard-bearer of the New Alliance Party and an advocate of Marxist-Leninist politics. “The Reform Party now includes a Klansman, Mr. Duke, a neo-Nazi, Mr. Buchanan, and a communist, Ms. Fulani,” he said in his statement. “This is not company I wish to keep.”\n\nBuchanan won the party’s nomination, but garnered less than one half of 1 percent of the vote in the general election that year.\n\nTrump also spoke out against Duke in 1991 — three days after Duke was defeated in his race for governor. Trump expressed concern in an interview with CNN’s Larry King about Duke’s politics and what it represented. Although Duke lost, he received a majority of the white vote.\n\nKing, Nov. 19, 1991: Did the David Duke thing bother you? Fifty-five percent of the whites in Louisiana voted for him. Trump: I hate — King: Four hundred New Yorkers contributed. Trump: I hate seeing what it represents, but I guess it just shows there’s a lot of hostility in this country. There’s a tremendous amount of hostility in the United States. King: Anger? Trump: It’s anger. I mean, that’s an anger vote. People are angry about what’s happened. People are angry about the jobs. If you look at Louisiana, they’re really in deep trouble. When you talk about the East Coast — it’s not the East Coast. It’s the East Coast, the middle coast, the West Coast — King: If he runs and Pat Buchanan runs [for president in 1992], might you see a really divided vote? Trump: Well, I think if they run, or even if David Duke — I mean, George Bush was very, very strong against David Duke. I think if he had it to do again, he might not have gotten involved in that campaign because I think David Duke now, if he runs, takes away almost exclusively Bush votes and then a guy like Cuomo runs — I think Cuomo can win the election. King: But Bush morally had to come out against him. Trump: I think Bush had to come out against him. I think Bush — if David Duke runs, David Duke is going to get a lot of votes. Whether that be good or bad, David Duke is going to get a lot of votes. Pat Buchanan — who really has many of the same theories, except it’s in a better package — Pat Buchanan is going to take a lot of votes away from George Bush. So if you have these two guys running, or even one of them running, I think George Bush could be in big trouble.\n\nSo, clearly, Trump knows something about David Duke, despite what he said.\n\nTrump, who conducted his “State of the Union” interview remotely from Florida, blamed a bad earpiece for his refusal to disavow Duke and condemn his politics during his interview with Tapper. Trump said he could “hardly hear what [Tapper] was saying.” That may be. But Trump clearly heard the name David Duke. In fact, he repeated it and claimed that he doesn’t know him.\n\n“Honestly, I don’t know David Duke,” Trump told Tapper. “I don’t believe I have ever met him. I’m pretty sure I didn’t meet him. And I just don’t know anything about him.”\n\nThe record proves him wrong.",

        "text": "A woman lights a candle during an International Holocaust Remembrance Day commemoration at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington on Jan. 27. (Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)\n\nA statement from President Trump marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day omitted any mention of Jews or anti-Semitism, a departure from recent bipartisan precedent set by previous presidents.\n\nThe statement calls for remembrance of “victims, survivors, heroes,” but nowhere does it ­mention the millions of Jewish people killed during the ­Holocaust, nor does it mention the ideology of anti-Semitism that led to the killings.\n\nHere’s the statement from Trump in full:\n\n“It is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember and honor the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust. It is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror.\n\n“Yet, we know that in the darkest hours of humanity, light shines the brightest. As we remember those who died, we are deeply grateful to those who risked their lives to save the innocent.\n\n(Reuters)\n\n“In the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in my power throughout my Presidency, and my life, to ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good. Together, we will make love and tolerance prevalent throughout the world.”\n\nIn a series of tweets, Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, noted the omissions.\n\n“@WhiteHouse statement on #HolocaustMemorialDay, misses that it was six million Jews who perished, not just ‘innocent ­people,’ ” Greenblatt tweeted. “Puzzling and troubling ­@WhiteHouse #Holocaust­MemorialDay stmt has no mention of Jews. GOP and Dem. presidents have done so in the past.”\n\nSteven Goldstein, executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, was also critical of the White House statement.\n\n“President Trump’s statement today for International Holocaust Remembrance Day makes NO MENTION of Jews,” he said in a statement. “How can you forget, Mr. President, that six million Jews were murdered because they were Jews? You chose the vague phrase ‘innocent people.’ They were Jews, Mr. President.”\n\nThe international day of ­remembrance has fallen on the day the Auschwitz concentration camp was liberated since 2006. Former president Barack Obama’s statements on the day noted the “6 million Jews and millions of other people” who were killed by Nazis. In 2005, when President George W. Bush marked the 60th anniversary of Auschwitz’s liberation, he declared it “a reminder that when we find anti-Semitism, we must come together to fight it.”\n\nIn 2007, Bush’s statement marking the day noted: “We must continue to condemn the resurgence of anti-Semitism, that same virulent intolerance that led to the Holocaust, and we must combat bigotry and hatred in all their forms, in America and abroad.”\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFred Brown, a spokesman for the Republican Jewish Coalition, blamed the controversy on ­political partisans.\n\n“It’s outrageous that people are using Holocaust Remembrance Day for partisan reasons or to try and settle scores,” Brown said in a statement. “The horrors of the Holocaust are not to be taken lightly. We must never forget the millions of Jews who suffered at the hands of hate, and the heroes who died fighting it.”",

        "text": "A blast caused by what the FBI called “an improvised explosive device” rocked a Bloomington Islamic center before dawn Saturday, just as a small group of Muslim worshipers had gathered for the day’s first round of prayers.\n\nNo one was hurt in the explosion, which heavily damaged an imam’s office at the Dar Al Farooq Center and sent smoke wafting through the large building. Windows in the office were shattered, either by the blast or by an object thrown through them.\n\nThe blast was reported at 5:05 a.m. as about a dozen people gathered in a room nearby for morning prayers and jolted awake many residents of the neighborhood. Congregants and neighbors expressed relief that there were no injuries, but also reacted with shock and dismay.\n\nWhen police arrived, they found smoke and fire damage to the building, said Bloomington Police Chief Jeff Potts. Agents from the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives soon joined the investigation. A large area outside the center was taped off as investigators, including members of the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force, combed through the grass.\n\nAt an early evening news conference, Special Agent in Charge Richard Thornton said an “improvised explosive device” caused the blast, but that investigators still must determine “who and why.”\n\n“The post-blast environment is very detailed,” he said. “You search the wide area in an attempt to find as many components as you can of the device to help us understand how the device was made. That process is substantially complete. … It was an improvised explosive device that was set off early this morning.”\n\nGallery: Photos: Blast at Dar Al Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington Gallery: Photos: Blast at Dar Al Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington\n\nWitnesses have been interviewed, evidence has been sent to various labs, and video and cellphone data are being analyzed, he said. He asked that anyone with information contact 1-800-CALL-FBI.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a news release saying that acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke was aware of the explosion and was “in close contact with federal, state and local authorities and local community leaders as the investigation into this matter continues.”\n\n“The Department of Homeland Security fully supports the rights of all to freely and safely worship the faith of their choosing and we vigorously condemn such attacks on any religious institution,” DHS said. “We are thankful that there were no injuries, but that does not diminish the serious nature of this act.”\n\nEven before the FBI update, congregants said the blast appeared to be a hate crime. Mohamed Omar, the center’s executive director, who was in the building when the explosion erupted, said one worshiper saw a pickup truck speed out of the parking lot after the blast.\n\nAt a noon news conference that included clergy from several faiths, Asad Zaman, director of the local Muslim American Society, described the attack as a firebombing.\n\n“Something blew up, we don’t know what, but there was a lot of smoke, and the fire suppression system kicked in and stopped the fire,” he said.\n\nNeighbors reported waking up to a loud bang or pop, some even feeling the concussion reverberate through windows.\n\nTrevin Miller, who lives across the street, said he has heard occasional fireworks in the neighborhood, but nothing like Saturday’s explosion.\n\n“It woke us up instead of my alarm,” he said. “It was loud; it was kind of like a firework-car crash-gunshot. It kind of shook me — like, you could feel it. I thought maybe somebody drove through our house or something. … I felt it on my insides.”\n\nMiller added, “I have a daughter that usually lives with me, and to wake up to all this, it’s like, what the hell, this shouldn’t be happening right at our doorstep.”\n\nYasir Abdalrahman, who has been worshiping at the mosque for two years, said it serves Muslims from around the metro area, and that children often attend weekend “dugsi” services to learn to memorize and recite the Qur’an, he said. Fajr, the first prayer of the day, usually involves older worshipers who live near the center, he said.\n\n“We came to this country for the same reason everyone else came here — freedom to worship,” Abdalrahman said. “And that freedom is under threat. Every other American should be insulted by this.”\n\nOmar said the center occasionally receives threatening or hateful calls and e-mails. Usually, he said, callers say “that we shouldn’t be here, that we are a burden to the community or we are harming it.”\n\nThe building was once the site of Northgate Elementary School and Concordia High School. It also served as a worship space for Maranatha Community Church. The Dar Al Farooq Center bought it in 2011 to use as a place of worship, community center and day care site.\n\nSome area residents opposed its establishment, and there have been occasional complaints about noise, traffic and parking problems. But Saturday’s attack was the first such incident at the center.\n\nMinnesota law enforcement reported 14 anti-Muslim bias incidents last year, according to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, a record high even as other categories have been on the decline.\n\nA group of boys stopped Saturday to survey the damage at the Dar Al Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington caused by an early morning bombing.\n\nAt the interfaith news conference, faith leaders spoke out against any attack on Minnesota Muslims.\n\n“An attack on a mosque is an attack on a synagogue is an attack on a church is an attack on all faith communities,” said the Rev. Curtiss DeYoung, CEO of the Minnesota Council of Churches. “So we stand with you.”\n\nNausheena Hussain, executive director of Reviving the Islamic Sisterhood for Empowerment, called for more interfaith dialogues. “Have more hard conversations around what is happening around us today,” she said. “We need your help now more than ever to continue to make Minnesota a welcoming and inclusive community.”\n\nMelvin Carter, who is running for mayor of St. Paul, said that as a black Christian, he found the image of a place of worship bombed during a time of prayer “one that I know, that we all should know, we cannot take lightly. … This has no place in Minnesota; this has no place in America; this has no place in our community.”\n\nSteve Hunegs, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas, issued a statement reaffirming JCRC’s “solidarity with the local Muslim community.”\n\nAnd Gov. Mark Dayton decried the incident and vowed to stay in close touch with law enforcement about the investigation. “Every place of worship, for all Minnesotans of every faith and culture, must be sacred and safe,” he said.\n\nThe Muslim American Society and the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations each offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.\n\nA group of women took part in Saturday afternoon prayers led by Dar Al Farooq Islamic Center Executive Director Mohamed Omar hours after an explosion at the center in Bloomington.\n\nStaff writers Miguel Otárola and Jennifer Brooks contributed to this report.",

Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe \"blood and soil\" chants began Friday night when torch-bearing protesters marched at the University of Virginia and clashed with counterprotesters.

        "text": "Spencer associates functioning as security checked journalists in at the door and led them upstairs to where Spencer and Damigo stood in front of a bookshelf and a screen where they showed slides and photos of the protest area in Charlottesville.\n\nSpencer blamed the authorities for what happened in Charlottesville, saying the city’s mayor and governor of Virginia have “blood on their hands” for not policing the situation properly. The alt-right, he said, is “nonviolent;” he waxed nostalgic while speaking about the hundreds of white nationalists marching through Charlottesville with torches on Friday night, calling the event “really beautiful.” Some fighting between them and counter-protesters reportedly took place during the Friday event; Saturday’s rally attracted militia members with guns, and descended into all-out street violence.\n\nBut one person who didn’t come in for unequivocal criticism was Charlottesville suspect James Alex Fields, who has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old woman who had come to protest the Unite the Right event. Fields was photographed earlier in the day at the rally with Vanguard America, a self-identified white supremacist and fascist group that attended the rally. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called the incident an act of terrorism. Videos of the incident show a vehicle authorities have said was driven by Fields accelerating into a crowd of protesters, injuring more than a dozen and killing Heyer.\n\n“I am not going to condemn this young man at this point,” Spencer said. When he first saw the video, he said, he saw it as a “malicious act of violence”; but he’s now less sure that it was a purposeful act and won’t come down on one side or another until an investigation is complete.\n\nThe press conference came just a few hours after Trump, whose initial reaction to Charlottesville had been muted and blamed “many sides” for the violence without singling out white supremacist groups, gave a grudging statement at the White House explicitly naming them after two days of criticism for not having done so. Photos from Charlottesville show Confederate and Nazi symbols among some of the demonstrators.\n\n“Racism is evil,” Trump said. “And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.”\n\nSpencer dismissed Trump’s statement as “kumbaya nonsense” and said he didn’t view it as a repudiation of his movement, which he defended as “non-violent.”\n\n“He sounded like a Sunday school teacher,” he said. “I just don’t take it seriously.”\n\nSpeaking to me afterwards, Damigo agreed that he didn’t take Trump’s words as an unequivocal denouncement of their movement.\n\n“I don’t know exactly what he meant by that statement,” Damigo said. “People in his position, they’re not stupid, they make these very ambiguous statements with words that are very loaded and hard to interpret.”",

        "text": "Sen. Tim Scott: Trump Has 'Obviously Reflected' On His Charlottesville Comments\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Shealah Craighead/White House Shealah Craighead/White House\n\nUpdated at 5:32 p.m. ET\n\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., met with President Trump at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the president's response to last month's protests and racial violence in Charlottesville, Va., as well as specific issues facing communities of color.\n\nScott — the only black Republican currently serving in the Senate — said Trump's moral authority was compromised after the president equated neo-Nazis, KKK members and other white supremacists who organized the protests with those who demonstrated in opposition to the white supremacists' message. Three people — a pedestrian struck when a car was driven into a crowd of counterprotesters and two Virginia State Police officers killed in a helicopter crash — died in connection with the violence.\n\n\"I think there's blame on both sides,\" Trump told reporters during a news conference at Trump Tower last month. \"You look at both sides — I think there's blame on both sides, and I have no doubt about it, and you don't have any doubt about it either.\"\n\n\"Racism is real. It is alive,\" Scott told VICE News in an interview that followed Trump's statements. He added, \"What we want to see from our president is clarity and moral authority. And that moral authority is compromised. ... There's no question about that.\"\n\nWhite House: Meeting \"very productive\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters during Wednesday's briefing that the president's meeting with Scott was \"very productive.\" She characterized their conversation as focused \"primarily on solutions moving forward.\"\n\n\"That was what both people came to the meeting wanting to discuss,\" she added, \"is what we can do to bring people together, not talk about divisions within the country.\"\n\nRegarding the president's initial response to the fatal violence in Charlottesville, Huckabee Sanders said the two men talked about it \"pretty in depth.\"\n\nShe also said Trump intends to sign a joint resolution condemning white supremacy, recently passed by Congress in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville and the national conversation about race relations it opened up.\n\nSpeaking to CBS News after Wednesday's meeting, Scott said the president has \"obviously reflected on what he has said [about Charlottesville], on his intentions and the perception of those comments.\" He added, \"I'll let him discuss how he feels about it, but he was certainly very clear that the perception that he received on his comments was not exactly what he intended with those comments.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Huckabee Sanders had told reporters the meeting was one that the senator \"wanted to have with the president, and the president wanted to have the opportunity to meet one-on-one with the senator.\"\n\nA source with knowledge of the planning said beforehand the meeting was born out of Scott's comments in an August interview with CBS News' Face the Nation, in which Scott said Trump needs personal connections to people of color.\n\n\"If the president wants to have a better understanding and appreciation for what he should do next, he needs to hear something from folks who have gone through this painful history,\" Scott told CBS News. \"Without that personal connection to the painful past, it will be hard for him to regain that moral authority, from my perspective.\"\n\nAnti-poverty efforts, HBCUs, criminal justice policy on the agenda\n\nThe source added that Scott intended to talk with Trump about anti-poverty initiatives and efforts to promote historically black colleges and universities — issues on which White House staffers and Scott's office have been working for months.\n\nA separate source told NPR beforehand that Scott planned to talk with Trump about bipartisan efforts on criminal justice and programs to help offenders re-enter society. Such initiatives were championed by former President Barack Obama, but prospects during the Trump administration have appeared dim.\n\nBut Wednesday Huckabee Sanders told reporters HBCUs had not come up in the meeting after all. The two men did discuss, however, \"adding additional personnel that can tap into the African-American community,\" according to Huckabee Sanders.\n\nPolitics South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott Reflects On A Tumultuous Year South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott Reflects On A Tumultuous Year Listen · 7:13 7:13\n\nThe meeting took place as Trump has struggled with his relationship with African-American lawmakers on Capitol Hill and the constituents they represent. In June, the Congressional Black Caucus declined a second meeting with Trump, after concluding that the concerns it had expressed during an initial meeting with the new president \"fell on deaf ears.\" The administration has also struggled recently with plans for an annual conference regarding HBCUs put on by the Education Department. And at a Black History Month event held at the White House soon after taking office, Trump railed against the media. But a few weeks later, Trump toured the new Smithsonian museum dedicated to African-American history while accompanied by Scott, HUD Secretary Ben Carson and others. \"This museum is a beautiful tribute to so many American heroes,\" Trump said at the time, according to the Washington Post. \"It's amazing to see.\"\n\nC-SPAN YouTube\n\nWednesday's meeting wasn't Scott's first high-profile plunge into issues of race and justice.\n\nFollowing last summer's widely publicized police shootings of black men in Louisiana, Minnesota and Dallas, Texas, Scott spoke on the Senate floor about his own encounters with law enforcement.\n\n\"I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself,\" Scott said at the time.\n\nHe added: \"I simply ask you this: Recognize that just because you do not feel the pain, the anguish of another, does not mean it does not exist. To ignore their struggles, our struggles, does not make them disappear. It will simply leave you blind and the American family very vulnerable.\"\n\nAfter his presidential one-on-one, Scott said it was those same themes that drove him to ask for a meeting with the president. \"What I wanted to get out of the conversation was a focus on fairness and opportunity,\" the senator also told CBS News. \"Most people of color, and frankly all Americans, want to be treated fairly in this nation, and they want access to opportunities.\"",

        "text": "The Trump presidency is a test. Institutions like the courts, the news media and the business community have all been tested. Now it's the NFL and the NBA's turn.\n\nThe president is embracing an \"us versus them\" conflict involving politics, patriotism and popular American pastimes. And there is an unmistakable racial element at play, since he is targeting prominent black players.\n\nOn Friday night, seemingly out of nowhere, President Trump criticized the National Football League broadly and athletes who kneel during the national anthem specifically. Analysts are now predicting further on-the-field protests at games.\n\nTrump waded into controversy with another league on Saturday morning. On Twitter he criticized Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry, who intends to skip the traditional NBA champs celebration at the White House.\n\n\"Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!\" Trump wrote twenty minutes after \"Fox & Friends\" mentioned the issue.\n\nNBA great LeBron James responded by calling the president a \"bum\" who misled his followers.\n\nU bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up! — LeBron James (@KingJames) September 23, 2017\n\n\"U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite,\" James tweeted. \"Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!\"\n\nTrump's remarks renewed the accusation made by ESPN anchor Jemele Hill a week ago -- that Trump \"is a white supremacist.\"\n\nCNN's Jake Tapper wryly tweeted on Saturday that Trump is \"focusing like a laser on the major problems of the American people: black professional athletes with opinions.\"\n\nThe anthem protests, which began when Colin Kaepernick kneeled during the national anthem last fall, seemed to come up randomly while Trump was rallying an Alabama crowd to support Luther Strange in a primary election.\n\nTrump said NFL owners should get rid of players like that.\n\n\"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he's fired. He's fired,'\" Trump said. \"You know, some owner is going to do that. He's going to say, 'That guy that disrespects our flag, he's fired.' And that owner, they don't know it [but] they'll be the most popular person in this country.\"\n\nThe president followed up on Twitter Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect. ... our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!\"\n\nOpponents of Trump accused him of failing to respect the First Amendment rights of Americans.\n\nTrump also said NFL ratings are down \"massively\" (that's not true -- the ratings are only down modestly) and criticized the NFL's efforts to make the game safer for athletes.\n\n\"There's a more important issue about the health of young, American athletes. And obviously the president wasn't too concerned about that,\" CNN sports analyst Christine Brennan said after the rally.\n\nThe president finished his NFL critique by saying it hurts the game \"when people like yourselves turn on television and you see those people taking the knee when they're playing our great national anthem.\"\n\nIn response, Mike Allen of Axios wrote Saturday morning, \"To address a largely white crowd as 'people like yourselves,' and refer to protesting athletes, often African American, as 'those people,' does nothing to heal the wounds of Charlottesville.\"\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell issued an unusual statement about the president's remarks, criticizing the \"divisive\" comments without calling out Trump by name.\n\nThe NFL players union spoke out more forcefully. And Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman, an active Twitter user, responded Saturday morning: \"The behavior of the President is unacceptable and needs to be addressed. If you do not Condemn this divisive Rhetoric you are Condoning it!!\"",

        "text": "President Donald Trump's comments on Friday in Alabama that NFL teams should cut any player who protests during the national anthem left a bad taste in the mouths of many players, and it turns out multiple ownership groups took issue with his speech as well.\n\n\"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b---- off the field right now,\" Trump said to a cheering crowd in Huntsville. \"Out. He's fired. He's fired.\"\n\nCommissioner Roger Goodell called out the president for his remarks, and players from Richard Sherman to LeSean McCoy and more shared their responses on Twitter. But they weren't alone in criticizing the president for his comments.\n\nGiants owners John Mara and Steve Tisch released a statement Saturday:\n\n\"Comments like we heard last night from the president are inappropriate, offensive and divisive. We are proud of our players, the vast majority of whom use their NFL platform to make a positive difference in our society.\"\n\nDolphins owner Stephen Ross:\n\n\"Our country needs unifying leadership right now, not more divisiveness. We need to seek to understand each other and have civil discourse instead of condemnation and sound bites. I know our players who kneeled for the anthem, and these are smart, young men of character who want to make our world a better place for everyone. They wanted to start a conversation and are making a difference in our community, including working with law enforcement to bring people together. We can all benefit from learning, listening and respecting each other. Sports are a common denominator in our world. We all have the responsibility to use this platform to promote understanding, respect and equality.\"\n\n49ers CEO Jed York:\n\n\"The callous and offensive comments made by the President are contradictory to what this great country stands for. Our players have exercised their rights as United States citizens in order to spark conversation and action to address social injustice. We will continue to support them in their peaceful pursuit of positive change in our country and around the world. The San Francisco 49ers will continue to work toward bringing communities, and those who serve them, closer together.\"\n\nPackers CEO Mark Murphy:\n\n\"It's unfortunate that the President decided to use his immense platform to make divisive and offensive statements about our players and the NFL. We strongly believe that players are leaders in our communities and positive influences. They have achieved their positions through tremendous work and dedication and should be celebrated for their success and positive impact. We believe it is important to support any of our players who choose to peacefully express themselves with the hope of change for good. As Americans, we are fortunate to be able to speak openly and freely.\"\n\nFalcons owner Arthur Blank didn't address the president directly in his statement but did talk about the need to \"make a positive impact\":\n\n\"We are at our very best when we are working together, building unity and including everyone's voice in a constructive dialogue. Creating division or demonizing viewpoints that are different than our own accomplishes nothing positive and undermines our collective ability to achieve the ideals of our democracy. The NFL has historically been a strong catalyst for positive change, and I'm proud of the way our players, coaches and staff use that platform to give back to our community and strive to be good citizens making a positive impact on this and future generations.\"\n\nTitans controlling owner Amy Adams Strunk also released a statement supporting NFL players:\n\n\"I am proud to stand with our players and support them in their work on and off the football field. I completely agree with Commissioner Goodell that we are better off as a nation when we are unified and pulling together. I have seen that kind of attitude first-hand in Tennessee and across our country in the many benevolent and public-spirited efforts of our NFL players, often without any public recognition. Our players make public contributions day-in and day-out and when I hear anyone making disparaging remarks about them, I know it has to be the result of not knowing what they bring to our communities or what they have accomplished.\"\n\nAccording to reports, Panthers owner Jerry Richardson has declined to make a statement in response to Trump's comments about the NFL and its players.\n\nThe NFL isn't the only sports league that's mired in conflict with the president. After Trump said he was rescinding the offer to the NBA champion Warriors to visit the White House due to comments by Stephen Curry, the president faced an uproar from current NBA players -- including four-time MVP LeBron James, who called Trump a \"bum\" for his tweet -- and former stars, including Kobe Bryant, who called out Trump for inspiring \"dissension and hatred.\"\n\nThe Warriors also released a response to Trump rescinding their invite:\n\nWhile we intended to meet as a team at the first opportunity we had this morning to collaboratively discuss a potential visit to the White House, we accept that President Trump has made it clear that we are not invited. We believe there is nothing more American than our citizens having the right to express themselves freely on matters important to them. We're disappointed that we did not have an opportunity during this process to share our views or have open dialogue on issues impacting our communities that we felt would be important to raise. In lieu of a visit to the White House, we have decided that we'll constructively use our trip to the nation's capital in February to celebrate equality, diversity, and inclusion -- the values that we embrace as an organization.\n\nIn the world of baseball, Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia said he would \"never\" visit Trump in the White House, per the New York Daily News:\n\n\"I just don't believe in anything that is Trump. So there wouldn't be any reason for me to go at all.\"\n\nQuarterback Colin Kaepernick, who rose to prominence outside of the NFL world for kneeling during the national anthem last season, remains without an NFL job.",

USA TODAY\n\nGolden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry looks on from the court in the first half of a game against the Indiana Pacers. (Photo: Trevor Ruszkowski, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nSpeaking to the media hours after President Trump tweeted that he had rescinded his White House invitation to Stephen Curry and the NBA champion Golden State Warriors, the two-time league MVP said seeing the president call out his name on social media was \"surreal.\"\n\n\"I don't know why he feels the need to target certain individuals rather than others,\" Curry told reporters in Oakland Saturday afternoon. \"I have an idea of why, but, it's just kind of beneath, I think, a leader of a country to go that route. It's not what leaders do.\"\n\nStephen Curry on Donald Trump. pic.twitter.com/XsMF5Cw7Tg — Chris Haynes (@ChrisBHaynes) September 23, 2017\n\nCurry said on Friday that he didn't want to visit the White House to celebrate the Warriors' title — an event that has become tradition for championship-winning teams over the years. While the Warriors had not received a formal invitation, team officials were of the belief that one would likely be extended if the team voted on attending the White House.\n\nTrump's tweet, which was sent Saturday morning in response to Curry's comments, read:\n\n\"Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!\"\n\nThe tweet was quickly met with widespread criticism from members of the sports world, including LeBron James, who tweeted:\n\n\"U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!\"\n\nMORE:Donald Trump rescinds White House invitation to Stephen Curry, Warriors\n\nMORE:LeBron James blasts 'bum' Donald Trump, says White House visit an honor 'until you showed up'\n\nCurry said the amount of support he's seen from players across the NBA since Trump's tweet has been \"unbelievable.\"\n\n\"It was amazing to see all these guys rally around each other and speak up,\" Curry said. \"That's what this is about. We're not trying to divide and separate this country. We're trying to bring everybody together and speak about love and togetherness and equality. I think that was demonstrated in response to what happened this morning, which is a powerful thing for sure.\"",

He's fired!'\"\n\nWatch his comments.\n\nThe out-of-nowhere riff, which trigged an instant online backlash in support of athletes like Colin Kaepernick, was part of a 1 hour, 20 minute ramble by Trump. He was speaking in support of Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who's threatened by Breitbart-backed candidate, Roy Moore, in Tuesday's primary.\n\nWhy it matters: In appealing to a Deep South audience, Trump waded into culturally sensitive territory that could freshen opposition elsewhere, and ignite a debate wholly unrelated to anything he's trying to accomplish.\n\nTo address a largely white crowd as \"people like yourselves,\" and refer to protesting athletes, often African American, as \"those people,\" does nothing to heal the wounds of Charlottesville.\n\nThe reaction ... USA Today columnist Christine Brennan, on CNN: \"I think we're going to see, potentially more NFL players taking a knee this weekend than we ever would have thought ... maybe even college players, too.\"\n\n\"My sense is that ... players are angry.\"\n\nis that ... players are angry.\" \"There's a more important issue about the health of young, American athletes. And obviously the president wasn't too concerned about that tonight.\"\n\nTrump also repeated a theme from a past rally in the South, about an NFL that's more aware of the danger of concussions:\n\n\"15 yards, throw him out of the game! They had that last week — I watched for a couple of minutes. And two guys — just really beautiful tackle. Boom: 15 yards! The referee gets on television, his wife is sitting at home, she's so proud of him — they're ruining the game.\" [Applause.]\n\nthrow him out of the game!

They want to hit, OK? They want to hit. But it is hurting the game.\"\n\nBe smart: Trump's NFL comments were generationally based, with the president inviting portrayals as a 71-year-old unfamiliar with the latest medical research, rather than a leader in touch with the concerns of rising generations of doctors, athletes and fans.\n\nFlashback ... Trump at a campaign rally in Lakeland, Fla., in October: \"See, we don't go by these new and very much softer NFL rules. Concussion? Oh! Oh! Got a little ding on the head — no, no, you can't play for the rest of the season. Our people are tough!\"",

        "text": "Oakland Athletics rookie catcher Bruce Maxwell became the first Major League Baseball player to kneel during the national anthem when he did so before Saturday night's 1-0 home victory against the Texas Rangers.\n\nMaxwell, 26, dropped to a knee and pressed his cap against his chest just outside Oakland's dugout during the anthem, adopting a protest started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in response to police treatment of blacks.\n\nMaxwell pressed his right hand against his heart while facing the flag, and teammates stood in a line next to him. Teammate Mark Canha, who is white, placed his hand on Maxwell's shoulder, and the two hugged after the anthem finished.\n\nAthletics catcher Bruce Maxwell kneels during the national anthem Saturday night in Oakland, while teammate Mark Canha places his hand on Maxwell's shoulder in a show of support. AP Photo/Eric Risberg\n\n\"My decision has been coming for a long time,\" Maxwell, the son of a U.S. Army veteran, said after the game. \"I know I was on the fence for a long time because I know no one in baseball has ever done it. I finally got to the point where I thought the inequality of man is being discussed, and it's being practiced from our president.\n\n\"The point of my kneeling is not to disrespect our military, it's not to disrespect our Constitution, it's not to disrespect this country. ... My hand over my heart symbolizes the fact that I am and I'll forever be an American citizen, and I'm more than grateful to be here. But my kneeling is what is getting the attention because I'm kneeling for the people that don't have a voice.\n\n\"And this goes beyond the black community, and this goes beyond the Hispanic community, because right now we're having an indifference and a racial divide in all types of people. It's being practiced from the highest power that we have in this country, and it's basically saying that it's OK to treat people differently. My kneeling, the way I did it, was to symbolize that I'm kneeling for a cause, but I'm in no way or form disrespecting my country or my flag.\"\n\nAthletics manager Bob Melvin said Maxwell addressed the team and told it of his decision. Players were supportive, Maxwell said.\n\nCanha approached Maxwell after the meeting to offer his support.\n\n\"I could tell he was getting kind of choked up and emotional about his beliefs and how he feels about the racial discrimination that's going on in this country right now,\" Canha said. \"I felt like every fiber in my being was telling me that he needed a brother today.\"\n\nMaxwell said he plans to continue kneeling during the anthem.\n\nThe A's issued a statement minutes after the national anthem ended, saying: \"The Oakland A's pride ourselves on being inclusive. We respect and support all of our players' constitutional rights and freedom of expression.\"\n\nMajor League Baseball also issued a statement later Saturday, saying the league \"has a longstanding tradition of honoring our nation prior to the start of our games. We also respect that each of our players is an individual with his own background, perspectives and opinions. We believe that our game will continue to bring our fans, their communities and our players together.\"\n\nEntering Saturday, Maxwell had played in 71 games this season, batting .244 with three homers and 21 RBIs.\n\nIn 2015, Maxwell told the Midland Reporter-Telegram that he was excited to play a game on the Fourth of July, as he was born on a U.S. military installation in Wiesbaden, Germany, while his father, Bruce Jr., did a tour of duty overseas with the U.S. Army.\n\n\"It means a little bit more to me,\" Maxwell said at the time. \"I take it a little more personal. It's closer to my heart than most holidays, and so it's just about a respect of guys that give their lives every day and their families that feel the repercussions of what they do over there, even in the States. It's a big thing for me, and it's an honor to play on this day.\"\n\nBefore Saturday's game, Maxwell referenced President Donald Trump's speech on Friday night, in which Trump was critical of NFL players who protest during the national anthem.\n\nDon't be surprised if you start seeing athletes kneeling in other sports now!! Comments like that coming from our president. WOW! ✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽 — Bruce T Maxwell (@bruu_truu13) September 23, 2017\n\nInequality is being displayed bigger than ever right now as our president shows that freeedom of protest and speech is not allowed.. — Bruce T Maxwell (@bruu_truu13) September 23, 2017\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Washington (CNN) In the last 24 hours, President Donald Trump has criticized NFL players who refuse to stand for the national anthem and NBA superstar Steph Curry for expressing ambivalence about whether or not to attend the traditional White House celebration for champions in professional sports.\n\nOn Friday night in Alabama, Trump condemned football players who either sit or protest in some other way during the national anthem -- and chastised the NFL owners for not coming down harder on them.\n\n\"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. He is fired. He's fired!\" Trump said to considerable applause from the overwhelmingly white crowd . \"Total disrespect of our heritage, a total disrespect of everything that we stand for. Everything that we stand for.\"\n\nThen, on Saturday morning, Trump tweeted this about Curry: \"Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team. Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!\"\n\nHe followed it up with two more tweets -- both focused, again, on the NFL. \"If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!\"\n\nIf a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect....\n\n...our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!\n\nOn one level, this is classic Trump. He feels as though he is being disrespected -- whether by NFL players not standing for the national anthem or by Curry saying if it was up to him, the Golden State Warriors would not visit the White House. (The Warriors, in a statement Saturday afternoon , said they would come to Washington and do events to promote diversity and inclusiveness rather than meet with Trump.)\n\nThey hit him, so he hit back.\n\nBut, there's something far more pernicious here. Both the NFL and the NBA are sports in which the vast majority of the players are black and the vast majority of owners are white. In the NFL, there are 0 black owners of the 32 teams. In the NBA, Michael Jordan is the lone black owner of a team.\n\nConsider that in the context of what Trump said both Friday night and Saturday.\n\nIn Alabama, Trump called the players who refuse to stand for the anthem \"sons of bitches\" and insisted that any owner worth his or her salt should fire them immediately.\n\nThat got a lot of attention -- and rightly so. But it's what Trump said next that's really telling. \"Total disrespect of our heritage, a total disrespect of everything that we stand for,\" he said --- adding for emphasis: \"Everything that we stand for.\"\n\nNotice the use of \"our heritage\" and \"we\" in those two sentences above.\n\nBut wait, there's more. In both his Curry tweet and his two NFL tweets, Trump expressed frustration that these lucky athletes felt the need to be ungrateful.\n\nTrump noted the \"great honor\" of going to the White House and the \"privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL.\" You should just be thankful for what you have and not be making any trouble, Trump is telling these players.\n\nHere's the thing: Even if we lived in a color-blind society, that would be a dangerous sentiment. After all, freedom of expression is right there in the First Amendment. And our brave soldiers didn't fight and die so that everyone stood during the national anthem. They fought so people could have the right to make a choice about whether or not they wanted to stand. That's the whole damn point of the First Amendment.\n\nThe thing is: We don't live in a color-blind society. Slavery sits at the founding roots of America. The goal of racial equality remains a goal, not an achievement. To pretend otherwise is to willfully blind yourself to hundreds years of history.\n\nEven more context darkens the picture for Trump. He played at racially coded language throughout his presidential campaign. He also displayed a stunningly simplistic view of the black community.\n\n\"You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed -- what the hell do you have to lose?\" Trump said of African-Americans in a speech to a largely white audience in Michigan during the campaign. When NBA star Dwyane Wade's cousin was shot in Chicago, Trump tweeted : \"Dwayne Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!\"\" He took an inordinate amount of time to condemn former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. And so on.\n\nAs President, Trump has done little too ease concerns about his racial views -- and, in fact, has heightened them. His handling of the Charlottesville, Virginia, protests -- in which white supremacists and neo-Nazis marched in protest of the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee -- was particularly alarming.\n\nEven as the protests turned violent -- one woman was killed -- Trump claimed that there were violent factions \"on many sides\" to be blamed. Days later, he doubled down on that false premise; \"I watched those very closely, much more closely than you people watched it,\" Trump said . \"And you have -- you had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent, and nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now.\"\n\nAlthough his administration tried desperately to move on from his remarks, it was made clear recently that Trump meant exactly what he said. The day after meeting at the White House with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott -- the lone black Republican in the Senate -- Trump was quick to note that he had been right in his initial comments after Charlottesville.\n\n\"I think especially in light of the advent of Antifa, if you look at what's going on there, you have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also, and essentially that's what I said,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nAnd now, this.\n\nI've long believed that Trump is simply saying whatever comes to mind, that there is no broader strategy to his comments. But it's impossible to conclude that after Charlottesville, Trump is totally ignorant of the racial context in which his remarks on the NFL and NBA land. No one is that oblivious.\n\nWhen, given all the water under the bridge -- both in terms of our country's history and the more narrow history of Trump's campaign -- you make comments about how the athletes in predominantly black pro sports leagues should just be happy with what they have and not complain, you aren't doing it by accident. You really believe it.\n\nPlay football or basketball so we can be entertained, Trump seems to be telling these athletes. No one wants to hear your lack of gratitude for what you've been given.\n\nThere's so many things wrong with that view.\n\nFirst of all, no one gave these players anything. They worked for it.\n\nSecond, just because you are a professional athlete doesn't mean you don't get to be a citizen, too. We don't tell accountants, for example, that they can't express their opinions on politics and the culture more broadly, right? So why should we be in the business of telling professional athletes? And would Trump feel the same way if the majority of those protesting the anthem were white?\n\nTrump defenders will note that Trump didn't name names -- other than Curry -- when he blasted professional athletes. That \"we\" are adding color to it, not him.\n\nBut that doesn't fly. As I noted above, both the NFL and NBA are majority black. And those refusing to stand during the national anthem are, with one exception, also all black.\n\nTrump knows this. He is an avid consumer of TV and culture. Which means that he is purposely playing at and with racial animus here. That is a dark thing to do as the leader of the United States. And something he deserves to be condemned for.",

        "text": "CLOSE SportsPulse: USA TODAY's NBA insider Sam Amick details his conversation with Kevin Durant on how the Twitter gaffe unfolded and how he plans to make amends. USA TODAY Sports\n\nGolden State Warriors' Kevin Durant, left, speaks with Stephen Curry (30) during the first half of a pre-season NBA basketball game against the Los Angeles Clippers in Oakland, Calif. (Photo: Ben Margot, AP)\n\nOAKLAND – For the rest of the NBA, media day will be about the Xs and Os. But for the Golden State Warriors, who have won two of the league’s last three championships and are the heavy favorites to win it all again this season, it’s the question of whether or not they’ll celebrate their latest title at the White House that remains front and center.\n\nDespite so many strong signs that the widespread distaste for President Trump would likely lead to them not taking part in the annual ritual, the team will meet to make a decision in the coming days. General manager Bob Myers made it clear that the team has had communication with the White House, and the door was left open for a possible visit.\n\nBut Warriors coach Steve Kerr and two-time MVP Steph Curry, the two men with more influence on the team’s culture than all the rest, reiterated their belief that they prefer not to attend. And make no mistake: Trump’s handling of the Charlottesville riot in mid-August is still fresh on the minds of the Warriors who see it the same way as Curry and Kerr.\n\n“I don’t want to go,” Curry reiterated. “That’s kind of the nucleus of my belief…(But) it’s not just me going to the White House. If it was, this would be a pretty short conversation.”\n\nWhen asked why he wants to skip the visit and what the intended message would be, Curry elaborated.\n\n“That we don’t stand for basically what our President has – the things that he’s said and the things that he hasn’t said in the right times, that we won’t stand for it,” Curry said. “And by acting and not going, hopefully that will inspire some change when it comes to what we tolerate in this country and what is accepted and what we turn a blind eye to. It’s not just the act of not going there. There are things you have to do on the back end to actually push that message into motion.\n\n“(Athletes are) all trying to do what we can. We’re using our platorms, using our opportunities to shed light on that, so that’s kind of where I stand on it. I don’t think us not going to the White House is going to miraculously make everything better, but this is my opportunity to voice that.”\n\nMore NBA:\n\nStill, as Myers indicated, the Warriors want to come to a collective conclusion.\n\n“We’ve had discussions with the White House; no decision has been reached on our side, and the plan is to meet with the team, ownership, (owner) Joe Lacob, myself, (coach) Steve (Kerr) will certainly be involved, and have a real honest dialogue about it,” Myers said. “From our opinion, my opinion, it deserves a proper forum. It deserves the right amount of thought, and so when we make the decision, we at least put in the right amount of time to make it. And that’s the next goal for us…We’re going to get in a room, and I think – with our coach, especially, and the relationship that we have with our players and front office and ownership – I think we’ll get some honest discourse in there. That’s what we want.”\n\nWarriors forward Draymond Green didn’t share his vote, but indicated that they would all respect the decision making process.\n\n“We’re going to have a discussion, pretty much kind of take the temperature of everyone, and we’re going to decide whatever is best, whatever we think is best for us,” he said. “But it may not be the popular thing to do, the most popular thing – whatever we decide. But at the end of the day, we are the ones who have to attend, if we decide to attend. I think it’s only right that we all decide together.”\n\nZaza Pachulia added some levity to the discussion, saying that he visited the president of Georgia in his native country’s version of the White House just in case the Warriors don’t make the trip.\n\n“I went to the White House (in Georgia),” he said. “I saw the president. It was great. Just in case, so no matter what happened I still did it.”\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick on Twitter @Sam_Amick.",
