        "text": "By Judith Bergman\n\nProving the point that the assault on Free Speech is being driven by Technocracy, the United Nations has openly joined the fray in the name of Sustainable Development, Agenda 2030, New Urban Agenda, etc. ⁃ Editor, Technocracy News & Trends.\n\nIn January, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, tasked his Special Adviser for the Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng, to “present a global plan of action against hate speech and hate crimes on a fast-track basis”. Speaking at a press conference about the UN’s challenges for 2019, Guterres maintained, “The biggest challenge that governments and institutions face today is to show that we care — and to mobilize solutions that respond to people’s fears and anxieties with answers…”\n\nOne of those answers, Guterres appeared to suggest, is shutting down free speech.\n\n“We need to enlist every segment of society in the battle for values that our world faces today – and, in particular, to tackle the rise of hate speech, xenophobia and intolerance. We hear troubling, hateful echoes of eras long past” Guterres said, “Poisonous views are penetrating political debates and polluting the mainstream. Let’s never forget the lessons of the 1930s. Hate speech and hate crimes are direct threats to human rights…”\n\nGuterres added, “Words are not enough. We need to be effective in both asserting our universal values and in addressing the root causes of fear, mistrust, anxiety and anger. That is the key to bring people along in defence of those values that are under such grave threat today”.\n\nIn other words, forget everything about the free exchange of ideas: the UN feels that its ‘values’ are being threatened and those who criticize those values must therefore be shut down. Not only that, but — disingenuously — the UN is comparing dissent from its agendas with the rise of fascism and Nazism in the 1930s.\n\nNow the action plan that Guterres spoke of in January is ready. On June 18, Guterres presented the United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech:\n\n“Hate speech is…an attack on tolerance, inclusion, diversity and the very essence of our human rights norms and principles,” Guterres said. He also wrote in an article on the subject, “To those who insist on using fear to divide communities, we must say: diversity is a richness, never a threat…We must never forget, after all, that each of us is an “other” to someone, somewhere”.\n\nAccording to the action plan, “Hate is moving into the mainstream – in liberal democracies and authoritarian systems alike. And with each broken norm, the pillars of our common humanity are weakened”. The UN sees for itself a crucial role: “As a matter of principle, the United Nations must confront hate speech at every turn. Silence can signal indifference to bigotry and intolerance…”.\n\nNaturally, the UN assures everyone that, “Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law”.\n\nExcept the UN most definitely seeks to limit freedom of speech, especially the kind that challenges the UN’s agendas. This was evident with regard to the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in which it was explicitly statedthat public funding to “media outlets that systematically promote intolerance, xenophobia, racism and other forms of discrimination towards migrants” should be stopped.\n\nIn contrast to the UN Global Migration compact, the UN’s action plan against hate speech does contain a definition of what the UN considers to be “hate” and it happens to be the broadest and vaguest of definitions possible:\n\n“Any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor”. With a definition as broad as this, all speech could be labelled “hate”.",

Instead, the agreement propagates the radical idea that migration -- for any reason -- is something that needs to be promoted, enabled and protected.\n\nA new UN agreement, which almost all member states plan to sign in December, propagates the radical idea that migration -- for any reason -- is something that needs to be promoted, enabled and protected. Pictured: Migrants walk through fields towards a holding camp in the village of Dobova, Slovenia on October 26, 2015. (Photo by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)\n\nThe United Nations, in a non-binding agreement that almost all UN member states will sign at a ceremony in Morocco in early December, is making migration a human right.\n\nThe finalized text of the agreement, the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, although officially non-binding, \"puts migration firmly on the global agenda. It will be a point of reference for years to come and induce real change on the ground...\" according to Jürg Lauber, the representative of Switzerland to the UN -- who led the work on the agreement together with the representative of Mexico.\n\nOne immediate irony, of course, is that few countries have entry requirements as restrictive as Switzerland's. If one wishes to stay more than three months, not only is a \"residence permit\" required, but, \"In an effort to limit immigration from non-EU/EFTA countries, Swiss authorities impose strict annual limitations on the number of residence and work permits granted to foreigners.\"\n\nThese hard-to-come-by-residencies have, unsurprisingly, become a source of income as \"[r]ich foreigners 'buy' Swiss residency.\"\n\nThe UN agreement, on the other hand, notes:\n\n\"Refugees and migrants are entitled to the same universal human rights and fundamental freedoms, which must be respected, protected and fulfilled at all times.\" (Preamble, section 4)\n\nIt cannot be stressed enough that this agreement is not about refugees fleeing persecution, or their rights to protection under international law. Instead, the agreement propagates the radical idea that migration -- for any reason -- is something that needs to be promoted, enabled and protected. Almost all UN member states, except for the United States, Austria, Australia, Croatia, Hungary and possibly also the Czech Republic and Poland, are expected to sign it.\n\nThe UN has denied that migration is being made into a human right. \"The question of whether this is an invidious way to start promoting a 'human right to migrate' is not correct. It's not in the text; there's no sinister project to advance that,\" Louise Arbour, the UN special representative for international migration, recently said.\n\nThe UN has no interest in admitting that the agreement promotes migration as a human right; until recently there has been little debate about it. More debate might risk jeopardizing the entire project. The wording of the agreement, as documented below, leaves little doubt, however, that with the signing of the agreement, migration will indeed become a human right.\n\nThe agreement is divided into 23 objectives toward which the signatories apparently wish to work. Objective number three, for instance, envisions the promotion and enabling of migration through a number of means. Signatory states commit to:\n\n\"Launch and publicize a centralized and publicly accessible national website to make information available on regular migration options, such as on country-specific immigration laws and policies, visa requirements, application formalities, fees and conversion criteria, employment permit requirements, professional qualification requirements, credential assessment and equivalences, training and study opportunities, and living costs and conditions, in order to inform the decisions of migrants.\"\n\nStates, in other words, are not only supposed to open their borders for the migrants of the world, but should also help them pick and choose their future country by providing them with comprehensive information about each country they may wish to settle in.\n\nThe service level envisioned to facilitate more migration is also high. Countries are called upon to:\n\n\"Establish open and accessible information points along relevant migration routes that can refer migrants to child-sensitive and gender-responsive support and counselling, offer opportunities to communicate with consular representatives of the country of origin, and make available relevant information, including on human rights and fundamental freedoms, appropriate protection and assistance, options and pathways for regular migration, and possibilities for return, in a language the person concerned understands.\"\n\nOnce migrants have arrived at their chosen destination, the signatory countries commit to:\n\n\"Provide newly arrived migrants with targeted, gender-responsive, child-sensitive, accessible and comprehensive information and legal guidance on their rights and obligations, including on compliance with national and local laws, obtaining of work and resident permits, status adjustments, registration with authorities, access to justice to file complaints about rights violations, as well as on access to basic services.\"\n\nMigrants are, evidently, citizens of a new world, in which all countries must spring to the assistance of anyone who has chosen to travel and reside there for whatever reason. Borders may exist in theory, but the UN -- comprising nearly all governments of the world -- is working hard at making them disappear in practice.\n\nMigrants, according to the agreement, must also be \"empowered to realize full inclusion and social cohesion\" in their new countries (objective 16). This means, among other things, that countries must:\n\n\"Promote mutual respect for the cultures, traditions and customs of communities of destination and of migrants by exchanging and implementing best practices on integration policies, programmes and activities, including on ways to promote acceptance of diversity and facilitate social cohesion and inclusion.\"\n\nAll cultures are equal and must be equally respected. Presumably, this means that, for example, the tradition of female genital mutilation (FGM), which almost all Somali women experience in Somalia, must be acknowledged in London and Paris as deserving of \"mutual respect\" in the same way that it would back in Mogadishu.\n\nThe agreement goes on to enumerate the work that states must initiate to accommodate migrants. \"National... policy goals regarding the inclusion of migrants in societies, including on labour market integration, family reunification, education, non-discrimination and health\" should be developed. In addition, the host country should facilitate \"access to decent work and employment for which they are most qualified, in accordance with local and national labour market demands and skills supply.\"\n\nIn other words, newly arrived migrants in, say, Europe, should have the same, or at least very similar, rights to education, the labor market and health care, as Europeans, who have worked hard and paid taxes for half a century to gain access to those very same things. Europeans, of course, will have to pay for all of this out of their tax money.\n\nThe authors of the agreement evidently do not expect it to go down all that well with their populations. An agreement to facilitate mass migration into primarily Western countries from the rest of the world (there is no migration to speak of in the opposite direction) may prove a bit much for people in the West. The agreement therefore clearly signals that any disagreement with the agenda will not be accepted and that the signatory states will work to dispel \"misleading narratives that generate negative perceptions of migrants.\"\n\nTo make this objective a reality, the signatory states first commit to:\n\n\"Promote independent, objective and quality reporting of media outlets, including internet-based information, including by sensitizing and educating media professionals on migration-related issues and terminology, investing in ethical reporting standards and advertising, and stopping allocation of public funding or material support to media outlets that systematically promote intolerance, xenophobia, racism and other forms of discrimination towards migrants, in full respect for the freedom of the media.\" (Objective 17)\n\nThis is Orwell on steroids. Almost all UN member states will sign an agreement that says media outlets that disagree with government policies will not be eligible for public funding? On top of this, the agreement claims, bizarrely, that it is being written \"in full respect for the freedom of the media\", as if that is going to make anyone actually believe it.\n\nSecond, the signatory states commit to:\n\n\"... eliminate all forms of discrimination, condemn and counter expressions, acts and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, violence, xenophobia and related intolerance against all migrants in conformity with international human rights law.\" (Objective 17)\n\nThe agreement, conveniently, offers no definitions of what constitutes \"racism\" or \"xenophobia\" in this context. What, for example, is \"related intolerance\"? Is criticism of UN migration policies, for instance, \"intolerance\"?\n\nOriginally, all UN member states, minus the United States, had approved the finalized text of the agreement and appeared ready to sign it in December. Recently, however, more states have announced that they are withdrawing from the agreement.\n\nIn July, Hungary withdrew from the agreement. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described it as \"entirely against Hungary's security interests,\" and added:\n\n\"This pact poses a threat to the world from the aspect that it could inspire millions [of migrants]. Its main premise is that migration is a good and inevitable phenomenon. We consider migration a bad process, which has extremely serious security implications.\"\n\nIn July, Australia also indicated that it would withdraw from the agreement, at least in its present form. According to Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton:\n\n\"We're not going to sign a deal that sacrifices anything in terms of our border protection policies... We're not going to surrender our sovereignty – I'm not going to allow unelected bodies dictate to us, to the Australian people.\"\n\nIn November, both the Czech Republic, and Poland announced that they were very likely to withdraw from the agreement and Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic wrote in a statement that she would not be signing the agreement. \"Our sovereign principles on securing our borders and controlling migration flows are absolutely the priority for us\", said Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.\n\nAlso just this month, Austria announced that it also would not be signing the agreement. \"We view some points of the migration pact very critically, such as the mixing up of seeking protection with labour migration,\" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said.\n\nThe European Union immediately criticized Austria's decision. \"We regret the decision that the Austrian government has taken. We continue to believe that migration is a global challenge where only global solutions and global responsibility sharing will bring results\" said an unnamed spokeswoman from the European Commission.\n\nThis is, by the way, the same EU that is supposedly going to be \"cracking down\" on migration. If you are \"cracking down\" on migration, why are you signing agreements that will facilitate and exponentiate it as a human right?",

        "text": "The new action plan plays straight into the OIC's decades-long attempts to ban criticism of Islam as 'hate speech'. In the wake of the launch of Guterres' action plan, Pakistan has already presented a six-point plan \"to address the new manifestations of racism and faith-based hatred, especially Islamophobia\" at the United Nations headquarters. The presentation was organized by Pakistan along with Turkey, the Holy See and the UN.\n\nIn contrast to the UN Global Migration compact, the UN's action plan against hate speech does contain a definition of what the UN considers to be \"hate\" and it happens to be the broadest and vaguest of definitions possible: \"Any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor\". With a definition as broad as this, all speech could be labelled \"hate\".\n\nExcept the UN most definitely seeks to prohibit freedom of speech, especially the kind that challenges the UN's agendas. This was evident with regard to the UN Global Compact on Migration, in which it was explicitly stated that public funding to \"media outlets that systematically promote intolerance, xenophobia, racism and other forms of discrimination towards migrants\" should be stopped.\n\nNaturally, the UN assures everyone that, \"Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law\".\n\nIn other words, forget everything about the free exchange of ideas: the UN feels that its 'values' are being threatened and those who criticize those values must therefore be shut down.\n\nIn January, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres commissioned \"a global plan of action against hate speech and hate crimes on a fast-track basis,\" and said that governments and institutions need \"to mobilize solutions that respond to people's fears and anxieties with answers...\" One of those answers, Guterres appeared to suggest, is shutting down free speech.

Speaking at a press conference about the UN's challenges for 2019, Guterres maintained, \"The biggest challenge that governments and institutions face today is to show that we care -- and to mobilize solutions that respond to people's fears and anxieties with answers...\"\n\nOne of those answers, Guterres appeared to suggest, is shutting down free speech.\n\n\"We need to enlist every segment of society in the battle for values that our world faces today – and, in particular, to tackle the rise of hate speech, xenophobia and intolerance. We hear troubling, hateful echoes of eras long past\" Guterres said, \"Poisonous views are penetrating political debates and polluting the mainstream. Let's never forget the lessons of the 1930s. Hate speech and hate crimes are direct threats to human rights...\"\n\nGuterres added, \"Words are not enough. We need to be effective in both asserting our universal values and in addressing the root causes of fear, mistrust, anxiety and anger. That is the key to bring people along in defence of those values that are under such grave threat today\".\n\nIn other words, forget everything about the free exchange of ideas: the UN feels that its 'values' are being threatened and those who criticize those values must therefore be shut down. Not only that, but -- disingenuously -- the UN is comparing dissent from its agendas with the rise of fascism and Nazism in the 1930s.\n\nNow the action plan that Guterres spoke of in January is ready. On June 18, Guterres presented the United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech:\n\n\"Hate speech is...an attack on tolerance, inclusion, diversity and the very essence of our human rights norms and principles,\" Guterres said. He also wrote in an article on the subject, \"To those who insist on using fear to divide communities, we must say: diversity is a richness, never a threat...We must never forget, after all, that each of us is an \"other\" to someone, somewhere\".\n\nAccording to the action plan, \"Hate is moving into the mainstream – in liberal democracies and authoritarian systems alike. And with each broken norm, the pillars of our common humanity are weakened\". The UN sees for itself a crucial role: \"As a matter of principle, the United Nations must confront hate speech at every turn. Silence can signal indifference to bigotry and intolerance...\".\n\nNaturally, the UN assures everyone that, \"Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law\".\n\nExcept the UN most definitely seeks to limit freedom of speech, especially the kind that challenges the UN's agendas. This was evident with regard to the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in which it was explicitly stated that public funding to \"media outlets that systematically promote intolerance, xenophobia, racism and other forms of discrimination towards migrants\" should be stopped.\n\nWhatever constitutes intolerance, xenophobia, racism or discrimination was naturally left undefined, making the provision a convenient catchall for governments who wish to defund media that dissent from current political orthodoxy on migration.[1]\n\nIn contrast to the UN Global Migration compact, the UN's action plan against hate speech does contain a definition of what the UN considers to be \"hate\" and it happens to be the broadest and vaguest of definitions possible:\n\n\"Any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor\". With a definition as broad as this, all speech could be labelled \"hate\".\n\nThe action plan, \"aims to give to the United Nations the room and the resources to address hate speech, which poses a threat to United Nations principles, values and programmes. Measures taken will be in line with international human rights norms and standards, in particular the right to freedom of opinion and expression. The objectives are twofold: Enhance UN efforts to address root causes and drivers of hate speech [and] enable effective UN responses to the impact of hate speech on societies\".\n\nThe UN makes it clear in the plan that it \"will implement actions at global and country level, as well as enhance internal cooperation among relevant UN entities\" to fight hate speech. It considers that \"Tackling hate speech is the responsibility of all – governments, societies, the private sector\" and it envisages \"a new generation of digital citizens, empowered to recognize, reject and stand up to hate speech\". What a brave new world.\n\nIn the plan, the UN sets up a number of areas of priority. Initially, the UN will \"need to know more to act effectively\" and it will therefore let \"relevant UN entities... recognize, monitor, collect data and analyze hate speech trends\". It will also seek to \"adopt a common understanding of the root causes and drivers of hate speech in order to take relevant action to best address and/or mitigate its impact\". In addition, the UN will \"identify and support actors who challenge hate speech\".\n\nUN entities will also \"implement human rights-centred measures which aim at countering retaliatory hate speech and escalation of violence\" and \"promote measures to ensure that the rights of victims are upheld, and their needs addressed, including through advocacy for remedies, access to justice and psychological counselling\".\n\nDisturbingly, the UN plans to put pressure directly on media and influence children through education:\n\n\"The UN system should establish and strengthen partnerships with new and traditional media to address hate speech narratives and promote the values of tolerance, non-discrimination, pluralism, and freedom of opinion and expression\" and \"take action in formal and informal education to ... promote the values and skills of Global Citizenship Education, and enhance Media and Information Literacy\".\n\nThe UN is acutely aware that it needs to leverage strategic partnerships with an array of global and local, governmental and private actors in order to reach its goal. \"The UN should establish/strengthen partnerships with relevant stakeholders, including those working in the tech industry. Most of the meaningful action against hate speech will not be taken by the UN alone, but by governments, regional and multilateral organizations, private companies, media, religious and other civil society actors\" the action plan notes. \"UN entities,\" it adds, \"should also engage private sector actors, including social media companies, on steps they can take to support UN principles and action to address and counter hate speech, encouraging partnerships between government, industry and civil society\". The UN also says that, \"upon request\" it will \"provide support to Member States in the field of capacity building and policy development to address hate speech.\"\n\nThe action plan also reveals that the first concrete initiative is already planned. It is an \"international conference on Education for Prevention with focus on addressing and countering Hate Speech which would involve Ministers of Education\".\n\nThe new action plan plays straight into the decades-long attempts of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to ban criticism of Islam. In the wake of the launch of Guterres' action plan, Pakistan has already presented a six-point plan \"to address the new manifestations of racism and faith-based hatred, especially Islamophobia\" at the United Nations headquarters. The presentation was organized by Pakistan along with Turkey, the Holy See and the UN.\n\nAccording to news reports, the plan was proposed by Pakistan's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi at a session titled \"Countering terrorism and other acts of violence based on religion or belief\".\n\n\"A particularly alarming development is the rise of Islamophobia which represents the recent manifestation of the age-old hatred that spawned anti-Semitism, racism, apartheid and many other forms of discrimination,\" the ambassador said in her speech. She added, \"My Prime Minister Imran Khan has recently again called for urgent action to counter Islamophobia, which is today the most prevalent expression of racism and hatred against 'the other'\".\n\n\"We are fully committed to support the UN's strategy on hate speech,\" said the Pakistani ambassador, \"This is a moment for all of us to come together to reverse the tide of hate and bigotry that threatens to undermine social solidarity and peaceful co-existence.\"\n\nIn 2017, Facebook's Vice President of Public Policy, Joel Kaplan, reportedly agreed to requests from Pakistan's Interior Minister Nisar Ali Khan, to \"remove fake accounts and explicit, hateful and provocative material that incites violence and terrorism\" because \"the entire Muslim Ummah was greatly disturbed and has serious concerns over the misuse of social media platforms to propagate blasphemous content\".\n\nAt the UN, Pakistan's Ambassador Lodhi called for government interventions to fight hate speech, including national legislation, and reportedly \"called for framing a more focused strategy to deal with the various expressions of Islamophobia. A 'whole of government' and a 'whole of society' approach was needed. In this regard, the Pakistani envoy urged the secretary-general to engage with a wide range of actors, including governments, civil society and social media companies to take action and stop social media users being funneled into online sources of radicalization\".\n\nThe UN's all-out war on free speech is on.\n\nJudith Bergman, a columnist, lawyer and political analyst, is a Distinguished Senior Fellow at Gatestone Institute.\n\n[1] According to Objective 17 of the UN Global Compact on migration, member states commit to: \"Promote independent, objective and quality reporting of media outlets, including internet-based information, including by sensitizing and educating media professionals on migration-related issues and terminology, investing in ethical reporting standards and advertising, and stopping allocation of public funding or material support to media outlets that systematically promote intolerance, xenophobia, racism and other forms of discrimination towards migrants, in full respect for the freedom of the media.\" [Emphasis added.]",

        "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The United Nations agreed on Friday on wide-ranging ways to cope with the millions of migrants moving from country to country, overcoming “mistrust” and “difficult” issues to draw up the first-ever migration pact, officials said.\n\nThe non-binding agreement, approved by all 193 member nations except the United States that pulled out last year, aims to make migration safe and orderly amid issues of national sovereignty and international cooperation, U.N. officials said.\n\nThe move came after the migration crisis in Europe in 2015, which saw the biggest influx of refugees and migrants since World War Two, officials said. The crisis strained resources and triggered fear of foreigners and nationalist tensions.\n\nSome 250 million people around the world are migrants, according to U.N. data, or 3.4 percent of the global population.\n\n“Migration is a fact. It has been here for centuries. It is here to stay for centuries more,” Miroslav Lajčák, president of the U.N. General Assembly, told a media briefing.\n\n“But we have never had an instrument that helps us to govern, to manage this process. We have been in reactive mode.”\n\nThe official Global Compact For Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration addresses why people migrate, how to protect them, how to integrate them into new countries, means of returning them home and other issues.\n\nAmbassador Jurg Lauber of Switzerland, who helped run the pact negotiations, called it a “catalog of measures” rather than a “one-size-fits-all” set of rules.\n\n“The strength, the force of the document is its practical value,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation ahead of Friday’s agreement.\n\nFormal adoption is set for December in Morocco.\n\nIt was agreed by 192 member nations after the United States quit the negotiations saying it was not compatible with U.S. sovereignty.\n\nHungarian media reported on Friday that Hungary’s foreign minister may propose that Budapest pull out of the pact because it could aid the flow of migrants to Europe.\n\nReaching agreement on the pact required overcoming distrust among adversarial nations, said Ambassador Juan José Gómez Camacho of Mexico, who also helped run the talks.\n\nHe said one objective of the pact is battling human trafficking which was “a cancer of the phenomenon on migration.”\n\n“The issue of migration is highly political, and there is naturally distrust or mistrust between countries on this,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We needed to strengthen the trust, build trust.”",

        "text": "Poland and the Czech Republic are set to join Hungary and Austria in pulling out of a United Nations pact on migration, as populist central European governments attack the deal before it is even signed.\n\nThe Global Compact For Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration was agreed in July by all UN members except the United States, and sets out norms for protecting and integrating people who migrate and ways to help them return home.\n\nThe pact is non-binding and recognises each state’s right to its own migration policy, but a growing number of anti-immigration leaders in central Europe are now rejecting it ahead of next month’s signing ceremony in Morocco.\n\n“It is very likely that, like Austria, the Czech Republic and the United States, we will not be part of the UN global compact,” Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Friday.\n\n“We believe that here our regulations, our sovereign rules on border protection and migration control are our absolute priority.”\n\nA day earlier, Czech prime minister Andrej Babis declared that he also opposed the pact.\n\n“It’s not clearly interpreted and it could be abused. The United States has pulled out, Hungary too, now Austria, and Poland is debating it as well,” he said.\n\n“I don’t like the fact that it blurs the distinction between legal and illegal migration . . . I will propose to partners in the government that we should do the same as Austria and Hungary,” he added ahead of cabinet talks on the pact next week.\n\nOn Wednesday, right-wing Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz – who rules in coalition with the nationalist Freedom Party – announced Vienna’s withdrawal.\n\n“We view some points of the migration pact very critically, such as the mixing up of seeking protection with labour migration,” he said.\n\n‘Global challenge’\n\nThe European Commission expressed regret over Austria’s decision and said it believed “migration is a global challenge where only global solutions and global responsibility sharing will bring results”.\n\nAdvocates of the pact emphasise that it is a framework agreement that does not impinge on the sovereignty of signatory states, and suggest that critics have either misunderstood it or are playing politics over migration.\n\nLouise Arbour, the UN special representative for international migration, said this week that “a lot of reasons that are advanced for disengaging are either mistaken or do not reflect what this global compact is all about”.\n\n“One of its main objectives is to reduce, if not to eliminate altogether, unsafe, chaotic, illegal poorly managed migration, which is in nobody’s interest – not the migrants, not the host communities, not the countries of origin,” she told Reuters.\n\nBrussels is suing Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland for refusing to accept refugees under an EU relocation plan.\n\nHungary quit the UN pact in July and now neighbouring Croatia’s position is also unclear.\n\nLocal media quoted right-wing president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic as saying she will not sign the deal, but that may be because it comes under the foreign ministry’s remit.\n\nCroatian foreign minister Marija Pejcinovic Buric said on Friday she thought the president supported the pact and expressed “surprise” at reports that she would not sign it in Marrakech.",

The force would reportedly have extensive powers to bear arms and even intervene beyond EU borders. A senior EU official described it as a “moment of truth” if Europe is serious about policing its borders and maintaining its core freedom of movement principal. But it has already provoked criticism from human rights groups who warned against creating a “fortress” towards outsiders, just because members cannot agree on how to deal with migration.\n\nThe move is also viewed in some circles as a precursor to the block establishing itself as a military power, as it pushes towards greater federal integration. A draft European Commission document setting out the plans, said the force’s role will be to protect “external borders, prevent secondary movements [between EU countries] and significantly step up the effective return of irregular migrants”. The aim is to enforce rules over movement between member states, such as France which had problems with border camps in Calais, and act outside the EU if it gains consent from external governments, according to the document seen by the Financial Times. The European Union launched the border force in October 2016, which is reportedly around 1,500-strong at present. The intention is to increase that almost sevenfold by 2020.\n\nJean-Claude Juncker will announce plans for a 10k border force",

Mr Morawiecki said Poland was assessing the pact, which is due to be implemented next month, but added its own migration controls are its priority.\n\nThe Polish Prime Minister said: “Our sovereign principles on securing our borders and controlling migration flows are absolutely the priority for us.” It comes after Poland clashed with the European Union over national quotes for asylum seekers earlier this year. Ms Merkel, who has faced heavy criticism for her decision to allow one million refugees into Germany in 2015, voiced her support for the UN pact that Germany has worked “intensively” on. The plan, which was approved by UN member states in July, aims to boost international cooperation on migration.\n\nMateusz Morawiecki revealed that it is “very likely” Poland will back out of the pact\n\nMateusz Morawiecki spoke in Warsaw with Angela Merkel\n\nSupporters have insisted it will not impact state sovereignty as it is not legally binding. But it has been met with increasing hostility as a number of key countries have pulled out. US President Donald Trump took America out of the pact in 2017. And this week Austria said it would not agree the deal over fears it would lead to the recognition of a \"human right to migration\" and a blurring of the lines between legal and illegal migration.",

(Keystone)\n\nObtaining a Swiss residence permit is not an easy process and comes with strict rules. This is particularly the case for third-country nationals. But money helps immensely.\n\nAccording to a report published by the Aargauer Zeitung newspaperexternal link on Friday, over the past eight years 523 foreigners who were considered ‘important public interests’ took advantage of a legal amendment and obtained Swiss residency. The breakdown by nationality is below:\n\nq The following content is sourced from external partners. We cannot guarantee that it is suitable for the visually or hearing impaired.\n\nTo help put together a successful residency application and negotiate with the authorities, people rely on specialist relocation lawyers and consultants, which can cost from CHF50,000 upwards.\n\nObtaining a permit to live and work in Switzerland depends on many factors, including where you are from, the skills you have and quotas. Citizens of the European Union and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) generally benefit from the free movement of people accord, while third-country nationals face stricter requirements and annual quotas.\n\nIn most instanceexternal links, non-EU/EFTA citizens need a job but having money is a huge help. Wealthy retirees with pre-existing close ties to Switzerland, or financially independent people with businesses, who pay considerable annual tax and can afford lawyers’ fees, can gain a head start.\n\nWealthy foreigners can also negotiate so-called ‘lump sum’ tax deals in certain cantons. These deals levy a charge equivalent to seven times the rental value of the taxpayer’s property, provided the person derives their income from abroad.\n\nSome rich third country nationals wanting to relocate have been assisted by a change to the Federal Act on Foreign Nationals in 2008external link. The law was amended to give cantons more freedom and leeway when deciding who gets a residency permit.\n\nArticle 30, paragraph b of the federal law states that in cases of ‘important public interests’, cantons may grant new applicants from non-EU/EFTA countries derogations from the strict admission requirements to secure an initial B residence permit.\n\nThe clause ‘important public interests’ is an elastic legal term. It relates to tax questions, but also to cultural (artists), political or legal issuesexternal link. In 2014, the Federal Migration Office told the NZZ newspaper that the criteria generally meant high taxpayers.\n\nNeuer Inhalt Horizontal Line\n\nLike swissinfo.ch? Meh? Let us know.

Twelve people have died. Children as young as 10 are trying to kill themselves,” he said.\n\n“It’s no wonder our government is trying to shirk scrutiny.”\n\nAmnesty International’s head of refugee and migrant rights, Charmain Mohamed, said a second, related global compact on refugees had been an ambitious endeavour that should have created wholesale change in the way refugees were treated by governments all over the world.\n\n“Sadly, world leaders were not up to the challenge of delivering the bold and brave solutions that are so urgently needed.”\n\n\n\nMohamed said the final text entrenched the current approach where states felt they could pick and choose which measures to adopt and which to reject, and that the responsibility for caring for the world’s displaced population, currently at record levels, would remain largely with developing countries least equipped to support them.\n\nAnd governments were already defying the intent of the compact, Mohamed said.\n\n\n\n“As diplomats were negotiating the compact at the UN, European governments were attacking NGOs’ capacity to rescue refugees stranded at sea and hatching new plans to deter and detain refugees, while Australia continued to justify its cruel and torturous detention practices on Manus and Nauru.\n\n\n\n“What is needed more than ever is a human-rights based, compassionate response to refugees’ needs, based on global responsibility sharing not responsibility shirking.”\n\nThe United States left negotiations on the global compact on migrants late last year, while last week, Hungary became the second UN member state to withdraw, with its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who was elected on an anti-immigration platform, pulling his nation from the deal.\n\n\n\nLabor has stayed relatively quiet on the issue, with immigration becoming the latest flashpoint in the super Saturday byelection campaigns, an issue which will continue to dominate the political agenda, as the nation heads to a general election in less than a year.\n\nEarlier this month, Dutton contradicted Scott Morrison’s claim that lower immigration levels would cost the budget, after it was revealed just under 162,420 people had permanently migrated to Australia in the last financial year, a drop from the 183,608 people who followed the same path the year before.\n\nMorrison had warned that following Tony Abbott’s proposal to cut migration numbers by 80,000 people would cost the Australian economy between $4bn and $5bn over four years, but Dutton argued there was an economic argument to make for cutting migration numbers.\n\nPeter Dutton contradicts Morrison and says migrant cut positive for the economy Read more\n\n“It’s [the impact of lower migration numbers] a positive one, because if we’re bringing more productive people in, then there’s more economic benefit for our country and there’s also greater societal benefit as well.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Dutton’s office announced 600 people smugglers had been arrested since Operation Sovereign Borders was initiated under the Abbott government in 2013, with 33 boats turned back and 70 people-smuggling operations interrupted.\n\nDutton released the information in an attempt to bolster his argument that Labor, under pressure from a push from its left factions, was seeking to dump the government’s policy and “restart the boats”.\n\nIn response, Bill Shorten said “the people smugglers will not get back into business regardless of who is the government of Australia”, while accusing Dutton of attempting to provoke people-smuggling operations into action.\n\n“I think the government is trying to goad the people smugglers and goad the boats,” Shorten said.\n\n“You almost get a sense they miss them. That’s the only issue they can talk about in the byelections.”",

        "text": "This article is more than 8 months old\n\nThis article is more than 8 months old\n\nBrussels has spoken out against Austria’s decision to join Hungary in not signing a UN global migration pact approved by most countries.\n\nThe rightwing government in Vienna announced on Wednesday that it would not agree to the global compact on migration because it feared this would lead to “a human right to migration”, a claim dismissed by the UN.\n\nHungary and the US have already withdrawn from the compact, while Poland is considering not signing the accord.\n\nA European commission spokeswoman said: “We regret the decision that the Austrian government has taken. We continue to believe that migration is a global challenge where only global solutions and global responsibility sharing will bring results.”\n\nAustria had played “an extremely constructive and key role” in the negotiations, she added.\n\nOn Thursday Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said he wanted to stop the Czech Republic joining the pact, arguing that the difference between legal and illegal migration was becoming blurred. “I will be proposing to my partners in government that we act in the same way as Austria or Hungary,” he told lawmakers, according to a parliamentary transcript.\n\nThe Visegrad countries in central Europe (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia) have clashed with the EU over mandatory refugee quotas.\n\nThe Austrian government, a coalition between the conservative People’s party and the far-right Freedom party, believes the pact mixes up the rights of asylum seekers with those of economic migrants.\n\nThe cabinet agreed to argue against any attempt to establish a human right to migration.\n\nLouise Arbour, the UN special representative for international migration, said: “The question of whether this is an invidious way to start promoting a ‘human right to migrate’ is not correct. It’s not in the text; there’s no sinister project to advance that.”\n\nShe described the decision as regrettable and said the compact aimed to improve the management of cross-border movements of people.\n\nThe compact, which is non-binding, states that nations have the sovereign right to “determine their national migration policy and their prerogative to govern migration within their jurisdiction”. It adds: “Within their sovereign jurisdiction, states may distinguish between regular and irregular migration status.”\n\nThe Austrian government was elected last year, following a backlash against the arrival of 1.2 million asylum seekers in the EU, many fleeing conflict in the Middle East. During the migration crisis of 2015, more than 90,000 people applied for asylum in Austria, more per capita than any other EU member state.\n\nAustria, which holds the EU rotating presidency, has faced questions as to whether its hardline stance on migration undermines its role as an honest broker in steering the EU towards a compromise on migration.\n\nThe chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, have led calls for tougher border security and creating offshore processing centres for migration – ideas that have caught on.\n\nThe EU wants north African countries to take more people rescued from the central Mediterranean, although progress in setting up these “disembarkation platforms” has been scant.

        "text": "\n\nA woman holds a placard that reads \"200 million victims” at a protest in Madrid against female genital mutilation around the world. (Marcos del Mazo/LightRocket/Getty Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nIn 2012, Somalia introduced a new constitution that was supposed to ban female genital mutilation. But a few years later, there had been little follow-up, and UNICEF still estimated that up to 98 percent of girls and women there had been cut.\n\nThis week, a Somali activist announced that a 10-year-old girl died in central Somalia in what she said was the direct result of an FGM procedure. Hawa Aden Mohamed, executive director of the Galkayo Education Center for Peace and Development, a Somali nongovernmental agency that advocates for women's rights, said in a statement that “the circumciser is suspected to have cut an important vein in the course of the operation.” The girl died two days later.\n\n“The woman who performed the operation has not been arrested, but even if she was, there is no law that would ensure she is punished for the act,” Mohamed said, according to Reuters. \"This is just one among many cases happening on a daily basis across Somalia.”\n\nFGM, which is sometimes called female circumcision, can take many forms but often includes the removal of the clitoris and some parts of the labia. It can cause lifelong health problems, including dangerous complications in childbirth. The United Nations identifies FGM as \"an extreme form of discrimination against women and girls.”\n\nThe World Health Organization says that FGM has no health benefits and estimates that worldwide 200 million women and girls have been subjected to it.\n\nWhile complications are common, deaths from FGM often go unreported or are registered under a different description. In one particularly high-profile case in 2015, an Egyptian doctor was convicted of manslaughter after he performed a cutting procedure on a 13-year-old who died soon after. The doctor, Raslan Fadl, rejected claims he cut her genitals and said she died as the result of an allergic reaction to medication. FGM was banned in Egypt in 2008, and according to the BBC, Fadl's prosecution was the first time an FGM case was brought to trial there. But NPR later reported that he was back to practicing medicine not long after the conviction.\n\nThe cutting procedure is typically performed by people who are not medically trained, and many activists resist efforts by medical professionals to perform FGM instead because it as seen as legitimizing the procedure. The U.N. Population Fund states that \"trained health professionals who perform female genital mutilation are violating girls' and women's rights to life, physical integrity and health.”\n\nIn a 2017 article for CNN, Mohamed wrote that about two-thirds of girls who experience FGM in Somalia are subjected to infibulation, which she described as \"the most extreme form, which leaves girls with their labia stitched together following excision of the clitoris.” The result can make \"urinating and menstruating almost impossible.”\n\nIn the roughly 30 countries around the world where FGM is still practiced, there can be deep-rooted stigma against those who do not go through with the procedure, which is often considered to be a crucial part of a \"coming-of-age” ceremony. In some places where resistance to FGM has grown, as in parts of rural Kenya, communities have stopped cutting their girls and have instead begun designing new ceremonies that can serve as a rite of passage without causing any physical harm.\n\nBut in many places, the practice remains pervasive — even if it's technically banned.\n\nIn Somalia, for one, Mohamed accused lawmakers of being \"afraid of losing their political clout among the all-powerful conservative traditional and religious groups bent at retaining the practice,” the Associated Press reported.",

        "text": "The OICs highly ambitious plans to do away with freedom of speech go severely underreported in the West. Mainstream journalists do not appear to find it dangerous that their freedom of speech should be supervised by the OIC, while Western governments, far from offering any resistance, appear, perhaps for votes, to be cozily going along with everything.\n\nThat part of the strategy has already had much success across the Western world, where authorities and media do not want to label Muslim terrorists as Islamic, but routinely describe them as \"mentally ill.\"\n\nThe OIC's media strategy encourages \"accurate and factual portrayal of Islam. Emphasis should be directed at avoidance of any link or association of Islam with terrorism or the use of Islamophobic rhetoric... such as labeling criminal terrorists as 'Islamic' fascists, 'Islamic' extremists.\"\n\nThe Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) is trying to curb your freedom of speech -- yet again. [1]\n\nIn June, the first \"1st Islamic-European Forum for examining ways of cooperation to curb hate speech in the media,\" initiated by the OIC, ironically but sadly took place at the Press Club Brussels Europe.\n\nThe director of the information department of the OIC, Maha Mustafa Aqeel, explained that the forum is part of the OIC's media strategy[2] to counter \"Islamophobia\":\n\n\"Our strategy focuses on interacting with the media, academics, and experts on various relevant topics, in addition to engaging with Western governments to raise awareness, support the efforts of Muslim civil society bodies in the West, and engage the latter in developing plans and programs to counter Islamophobia.\"\n\nUnlike almost all other intergovernmental organizations, the OIC wields both religious and political power. It describes itself as:\n\n\"...the second largest inter-governmental organization after the United Nations with a membership of 57 states spread over four continents. The Organization is the collective voice of the Muslim world... espousing all causes close to the hearts of over 1.5 billion Muslims of the world.\"\n\nAccording to the OIC's Charter, one of the objectives of the organization is \"To disseminate, promote and preserve the Islamic teachings and values based on moderation and tolerance, promote Islamic culture and safeguard Islamic heritage,\"[3] as well as \"To protect and defend the true image of Islam, to combat defamation of Islam and encourage dialogue among civilisations and religions.\"[4]\n\nAt the 11th Session of The Islamic Summit Conference (Session of The Muslim Ummah in The 21St Century) in Dakar, Senegal (13-14 March 2008), the member states of the OIC decided to \"renew our pledge to work harder to make sure that Islam's true image is better projected the world over...\"[5] and to \"seek to combat an Islamophobia with designs to distort our religion\"[6].\n\nIn 2008, the OIC published its 1st OIC Observatory Report on Islamophobia. This document listed a number of interactions that OIC representatives had with Western audiences -- including the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and academics and others at universities such as Georgetown and Oxford -- and stated:\n\n\"The point that was underscored in all these interactions was that Islamophobia was gradually gaining inroads into the mind-set of the common people in Western societies, a fact that has created a negative and distorted perception of Islam. It was emphasized that Muslims and Western societies would have to address the issue with a sense of commitment to ending Islamophobia... Islamophobia poses a threat not only to Muslims but to the world at large.\"[7]\n\nSince that 1st OIC Observatory Report on Islamophobia, the OIC opened its Permanent Observer Mission to the EU (in 2013) and also cooperates with the OSCE and the Council of Europe \"to combat stereotypes and misunderstandings and foster tolerance.\"[8] In December 2017, the OIC and the EU agreed on strengthening bilateral cooperation, when they held their second Senior Officials' Meeting (SOM) at the OIC headquarters, during which both sides agreed on \"strengthening bilateral cooperation through concrete actions\".\n\nThe OIC was concrete in its demands to the West. In a statement delivered at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the OIC Secretary General called for Europe to \"Prosecute and punish for racial discrimination... through the framework of appropriate legislation\" and also to \"Strengthen existing legislation on discrimination and discriminatory and 'unequal treatment' adopted by EU council directives\"[9].\n\nToday, many Western European governments are prosecuting their own citizens for criticizing Islam or Muslims in, for example, Sweden, Germany and the UK, although it is unclear, whether or how much of this development can be directly attributed to the OIC.\n\nIn Sweden, for instance, pensioners especially have been prosecuted for making critical comments about Islam on Facebook. A 71-year-old woman referred to so-called unaccompanied minors as \"bearded children\" and said -- not inaccurately (here and here and here) -- that some seem to be \"engaged in rape and demolishing their [asylum] homes\". In February 2018, a Swedish court sentenced her to a fine for \"incitement of hatred against an ethnic group\".\n\nIn Germany, a journalist, Michael Stürzenberger, was handed a six-month suspended jail sentence for posting on his Facebook page a historical photo of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, shaking the hand of a senior Nazi official in Berlin in 1941. The prosecution accused Stürzenberger of \"inciting hatred towards Islam\" and \"denigrating Islam\" by publishing the photograph.\n\nIn addition to cultivating high-level contacts with Western actors, the OIC also is pursuing a comprehensive media strategy, agreed upon in Saudi Arabia in December 2016 and focused on the West.\n\nThis OIC media strategy claims as one of its goals:\n\n\"To increase the interaction with media outlets and professionals, while encouraging accurate and factual/portrayal of Islam. Emphasis should be directed at avoidance of any link or association of Islam with terrorism or the use of Islamophobic rhetoric in the war on terror, such as labeling criminal terrorists as 'Islamic' fascists, 'Islamic' extremists.\"[10]\n\nPart of that strategy has already had much success across the Western world, where authorities and media do not want to label Muslim terrorists as Islamic, but routinely describe them as \"mentally ill.\"\n\nThe OIC also notes that it would like media professionals and journalists \"to develop, articulate and implement voluntary codes of conduct to counter Islamophobia\"[11], while at the same time engaging Western governments \"in creating awareness against the dangers of Islamophobia by addressing the responsibility of media on the issue\"[12]. The OIC additionally states that it would like to train foreign journalists to \"deal with the phenomenon of hatred and defamation of the Islamic religion\"[13]-- as exemplified by the recent European-Islamic Forum, where attendees were introduced to the OIC's \"Program for Training Media Professionals on Redressing Stereotypes about Islam\".\n\nAs maintained earlier here, European journalists -- helped along by the EU -- are already very adept at censoring themselves, which means that the OIC's work is probably already more than half-done when it comes to Europe.\n\nFinally, the OIC media strategy calls for fostering a \"network of high profile western public figures supporting efforts to combat Islamophobia in politics, journalism and civil society\" as well as teams of scholars academics, and celebrities, who will be the faces of the campaign.[14]\n\nThe IOC mentions the following, among others, as examples of mass media campaigns it aims to launch as part of its media strategy[15]:\n\nTelevision and advertising campaigns \"targeting public transport (bus and metro) famous newspapers and magazines for each country two times in one year\".\n\nArranging three talk shows per year in key TV channels in US and Europe about Islam with the participation of selected members from Muslim countries.\n\n10 lectures per year in each country (universities, unions and suggested important centers) \"about Islamic role in building cultures and connect between religions\".\n\nVisits to schools and universities by OIC \"specialist teams\".\n\nHosting 100 \"Western activists\" from various fields in selected Muslim countries where they \"can interact with intellectuals, politicians, media figures, and religious scholars\".\n\nProduce one-hour documentary \"examining the growth of Islamophobia in the West and its impact on Muslims around the world and interfaith relations\" for broadcasting \"on mainstream networks such as Britain's BBC and Channel 4 or America's PBS\".\n\nThe OIC is being assisted in all these efforts by \"prestigious public relations companies such as UNITAS Communications which is based in London, UK and Golden Cap based in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\"[16].\n\nThe OIC promises that it will also create a fund to support local anti-Islamophobia initiatives, and monitor media and place commentary and news stories in key Western publications.\n\nIt is important to note that in the years 1998-2011, the OIC sought to advance an agenda in the UN, banning \"the defamation of religions\", but the OIC gave up on the ban after realizing that there was not sufficient support there for the proposal. \"We could not convince them,\" said Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, the Turkish head of the IOC at the time. \"The European countries don't vote with us, the United States doesn't vote with us.\"\n\nInstead of pursuing the ban on defamation of religions, the OIC shifted its focus to UN Resolution 16/18 [17] which calls upon states to take concrete steps to prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion, \"foster religious freedom and pluralism,\" and \"counter religious profiling which is understood to be the invidious use of religion as a criterion in conducting questionings, searches and other law enforcement investigative procedures.\"\n\nAndrew C. McCarthy, a critic of Resolution 16/18, maintains that:\n\n\"Sharia forbids any speech — whether true or not — that casts Islam in an unfavorable light, dissents from settled Muslim doctrine, has the potential to sow discord within the ummah, or entices Muslims to renounce Islam or convert to other faiths. The idea is not merely to ban gratuitous ridicule — which, by the way, sensible people realize government should not do (and, under our Constitution, may not do) even if they themselves are repulsed by gratuitous ridicule. The objective is to ban all critical examination of Islam, period...\" [Emphasis in original]\n\nThe OICs highly ambitious plans to do away with freedom of speech go severely underreported in the West.

        "text": "ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Ch Nisar Ali Khan on Friday said that the government of Pakistan firmly believes in freedom of expression but “we cannot allow anyone to misuse social media for hurting religious sentiments” or to undertake unlawful activities.\n\n“We appreciate the understanding shown by the Facebook administration and the cooperation being extended to us on these issues,” he said during a meeting with Vice President of Facebook, Joel Kaplan in Islamabad.\n\nIn a major development regarding efforts being made for countering and removing sacrilegious content from social media, the Interior Minister and Kaplan discussed various steps and actions being taken to remove blasphemous content that is illegal in Pakistan, Spokesperson of the Interior Ministry said.\n\nFacebook, on its part, has reiterated its commitment to keep the platform safe and promote values that are in congruence with its Community Standards. It also committed to remove fake accounts, explicit, hateful and provocative material that incites violence and terrorism.\n\nGiving details of the meeting, the Spokesperson said that this is for the first time that a senior member of Facebook management dealing with Global Public Policy has visited Pakistan to discuss way forward towards addressing the issue of misuse of social media platforms especially Facebook which has over 33 million users in Pakistan at the moment.\n\nThe Interior Minister, said the spokesperson, has been playing a proactive role in engaging the Internet service providers and finding solution to the issue of misuse of social media.\n\nThis also included convening of a special meeting of the Ambassadors of the Muslim countries in March on a single point agenda to discuss blasphemous content on social media and how to effectively raise voice of the entire Muslim world against the madness unleashed against Islam and holy personalities in the name of freedom of expression. This was followed by a meeting of the Minister with Secretary General Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on April 11, 2017 on this issue.\n\nThe Spokesperson said that while talking to the Vice President, the Interior Minister said that the entire Muslim Ummah was greatly disturbed and has serious concerns over the misuse of social media platforms to propagate blasphemous content. “Nothing is more sacred to us than our religion and our holy personalities”, observed the Minister.\n\nThe Minister also appreciated Facebook for bridging communication gaps and providing people a platform not only to interact but also serving as a vehicle for promotion of education, businesses, socio-economic development and empowering women in the country.\n\nTo further this purpose in Pakistan, the Interior Minister also encouraged Facebook to open up office in Pakistan. Local offices of service providers would not only help them extending their outreach but would also be instrumental in bringing the government and the service providers further closer to each other and forge a mutually beneficial partnership, continued the Minister.\n\nDuring the meeting Kaplan highlighted various initiatives of Facebook that are aimed at skill development and economic growth programs in Pakistan, working with developers, small businesses and women in the country.\n\nHe said, “Facebook’s Developers Circles-a free community-led program for developers to connect, learn and collaborated with other local developers-have been started in Lahore and Karachi and would be launched in Islamabad soon. Lahore is one of the largest Developer Circles in the world with more than 2000 community members.”\n\nPublished in Daily Times, July 8th , 2017.",

        "text": "Pakistan proposes plan at UN to address faith-based hatred, Islamophobia\n\nNEW YORK: Pakistan on Monday proposed a six-point plan to address the new manifestations of racism and faith-based hatred, especially Islamophobia at the United Nations headquarters, organised by Pakistan along with Turkey, the Holy See and the UN.\n\nThe plan was proposed by Pakistan's Permanent Representative to the UN Maleeha Lodhi at a session titled \"Countering terrorism and other acts of violence based on religion or belief\" in the wake of the launch last week by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres of his strategy and action plan against hate speech.\n\nOther speakers also called for effective steps to counter the challenge posed by the growing phenomenon of faith-based hatred and violence so as to promote peaceful, inclusive and just societies around the world.\n\n\"A particularly alarming development is the rise of Islamophobia which represents the recent manifestation of the age-old hatred that spawned anti-Semitism, racism, apartheid and many other forms of discrimination,\" the ambassador said in her speech.\n\nShe added, Prime Minister Imran Khan had repeatedly called for urgent action to counter Islamophobia at various forums. \"We encourage the UN and other relevant organisations to address this issue.\"\n\nParticipants in the discussion that ensued at the event praised Ambassador Lodhi for the timely move. With an increasing trend of violence based on religion, and hateful narratives spreading across the world, this event was aimed at discussing this important issue and help in charting a way forward, the Pakistani envoy told APP.\n\nPanellists included, apart from ambassadors of Turkey and the Holy See (Vatican) and Under-Secretary-General of Office of Counter Terrorism Vladimir Voronkov, Imam Faisal Abdul Rauf, president of Cordoba House, and the UN Chief’s Advisor on Prevention of Genocide Adama Dieng.\n\nAmong others who took part included ambassadors of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Somalia, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. In her remarks, Ambassador Lodhi elaborated the six points to deal with hate-driven violence and Islamophobia.\n\nGovernments needs to adopt legislation to address the issue, she said, adding that tech companies must prevent digital technologies and social media platforms from becoming channels for inflammatory content, incitement and negative stereotyping.\n\nAs regards Islamophobia, she said it must be countered through a focused strategy as social tensions engendered by it posed a risk to vulnerable Muslim migrants and refugees in the West, besides potentially threatening the social cohesion of host communities.\n\nAlso, there was need to boost investment in enhanced research to monitor the trends and analyse the root-causes and drivers of violence incited by religious hatred. Engagement with youth and women as well youth was imperative to establish tolerant and inclusive societies as also the critical need to increase investment in education. \"As hatred is born in the mind, education would be key to promoting peace and tolerance,\" the Pakistani envoy remarked.\n\nReferring to the recent tragic events in Christchurch, Sri Lanka and Pittsburg, she said hateful views and words are not only consequential – they can kill.\n\nMore disturbingly, she said, this does not seem to be an isolated phenomenon limited to fringe groups on society’s periphery and called for addressing it. \"Populist narratives are being exploited by demagogues as a strategy to achieve political objectives,\" she said.\n\n\"In many parts of the world, including our own region, hateful rhetoric is being used to secure narrow political and electoral gains.\" Ambassador Lodhi added, \"Our efforts to promote more peaceful societies must be founded on the most fundamental of human values that call for tolerance and respect for human life.\n\n\"Let this be a moment for all of us to come together to reverse the tide of hate and intolerance and its violent manifestations. If we have to eliminate terrorism, we must eliminate its root causes.\n\n\"In his remarks, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism Vladimir Voronkov noted an alarming rise in hate speech, xenophobia and other forms of bigotry, which can incite violence.”\n\nHe pointed to a resurgence of anti-Semitism and Neo-Nazi organisations, while attacks on Muslims in several societies were on the rise. \"Violence driven by ideology can only be effectively countered by more powerful ideological arguments,\" Voronkov said, adding that religious leaders and faith-based organisations have vital roles to play in promoting understanding and acting as advocates for peace and harmony.\n\nVictims, he said, were extremely powerful and credible messengers, and their experiences put a human face to the impact of terrorism and help to counter the warped narratives of terrorists and violent extremists.\n\nTurkish Ambassador Feridun Hadi Sinirlioglu called for stepping up efforts to combat racism as, \"We can no longer turn a blind eye to this phenomenon, which is becoming more and more mainstream in several societies.\n\n“All relevant actors, including teachers, community and religious leaders, had an important role to educate the young generation. \"We also need to take a closer look at the root causes of these phenomena,\" he said.\n\n\"Children are not born with hatred. Hatred is taught, it is acquired. It is our responsibility to make sure that our children are taught to respect the other. \"The Turkish envoy urged governments to work on increasing pluralism, inclusiveness and creating equal opportunities for all.\n\n\"We need to ensure that women play a full and active role in this process.” The Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the UN, Archbishop Bernardito Auza, said that protecting the right to freedom of religion, conscience and belief was an essential first step in countering terrorism and other acts of violence against religious believers and in promoting a culture of tolerance and inclusion.\n\n\"Religion is not a problem but a part of the solution,” he said, while stressing that teaching in schools, pulpits and through the internet do not foment intransigence and extremist radicalisation but dialogue, respect for others and reconciliation.\n\nAdama Dieng, Special Advisor on the Prevention of Genocide referred to the challenge of hate speech, said in both liberal democracies and authoritarian regimes, some political leaders are bringing the hate-fuelled ideas and language of these groups into the mainstream.”\n\nAddressing hate speech should never be confused with suppressing freedom of expression. Instead, it should keep it from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence,\" Dieng said.\n\nSaudi Arabian Ambassador Abdullah Al-Mouallimi stressed the need for building counter-narratives against religion based violence and terrorism. He said there was a need to address the root causes of the problem and that freedom of expression must not be used to incite violence and hatred.\n\nQatar’s Ambassador to the UN Sheikha Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani reiterated the importance of quality education, social inclusion and justice for addressing this challenge. The Deputy Permanent Representative of Indonesia said that a whole-of-society approach is needed to address the issue of violence and terrorism incited by hatred. Interfaith dialogue was important for addressing this issue, and countries must join resources to tackle the problem, he said.",

They're bitter. For our friends in Hesse as well as for us in the Bund. \"And it also doesn't help that this state election, like any other state election, was just that, a state election. Because there is no doubt that our friends in Hesse could have gotten significantly better results if they hadn't been under the negative Federal political influence. \"Secondly, this fourth term is my last as German chancellor. At the federal election in 2021, I will not stand again as chancellor candidate, nor as a candidate for the Bundestag, and I won't seek any further political offices.\" Angela Merkel, 64, has been CDU chairwoman since 2000 and giving up the role will start a race within the party to succeed her as chancellor. Mrs Merkel has been at the helm of Germany for 13 years after becoming the German chancellor in 2005. Speaking in Berlin following the shock announcement, she said it was time to \"open a new chapter\".\n\nMerkel quits: Angela Merkel speaks following her announcement\n\nThe German leader told how she had made the decision to stand down as CDU party leader before summer recess in parliament and had planned her announcement for next week.She said: \"I have now been the chairwoman of the CDU in Germany for over 18 years. \"A task I have tried to do with passion and dedication. And for almost 13 years I have been federal chancellor of the federal republic Germany. An office, which is a daily honour and challenge to do. \"When I publicly announced my first candidacy on the 30 May 2005 right here, I explained it with the fact that I want to serve Germany. To serve Germany and the people is one of the most challenging but also fulfilling task, in these times. And I am very thankful that I have been able to do this for this long. \"I once said I wasn't born a chancellor and I never forgot this.\" Mrs Merkel said her decision was to allow for the CDU to prepare for future success. She said: \"With this decision, I am trying to contribute to allowing the government to concentrate its strength, finally, on governing well and people rightly demand that. \"At the same time, she said the CDU will be able \"to prepare for the time after me.\"She said Brexit and US-Russia tensions would continue to be the two main issues she focused on as long as she is chancellor. Mrs Merkel declined to back any of the candidates seeking to replace her as party leader of the centre-right CDU at a convention in December. Speaking after a closed-door meeting, Mrs Merkel said: \"It's true that Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and Jens Spahn both announced their candidacy today.\" She added she did not want to influence the election of her successor as CDU party leader. Asked whether her announcement not to run for a fifth term as chancellor also applied for a snap election before 2021, Mrs Merkel said she did not want to participate in any further speculation.\n\nMerkel quits: Angela Merkel said she took responsibility for the collation government's failings\n\nIt comes as Marcel Dirsus, political scientist, suggested it was the \"beginning of the end\" for \"lame duck\" Mrs Merkel. He tweeted: \"People have often talked about the beginning of the end of Merkel, but this is truly it. \"I doubt that Merkel will stay Chancellor for long once she is no longer Chairman of the party. The race for her succession will accelerate. If she wasn't a lame duck before, she's one now.\"wqw Standing down from the party chair will allow a new CDU chairman or woman to build a profile before the next national election, due in 2021. Mrs Merkel's favoured successor is CDU party secretary general Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who has announced her bid to become Chancellor today, as well as Bundestag member Jens Spahn. While, former member of the Bundestag, and a former chairman of CDU/CSU parliamentary group Friedrich Merz has also been tipped to replace her.\n\nMerkel quits: Angela Merkel's announcement could signal the end of her career as Chancellor\n\nThe German leader was under intense pressure last night following the elections in the western state of Hesse on Sunday, the second electoral setback in as many weeks for Merkel's conservative alliance. Mrs Merkel’s Christian democrats and her SPD coalition actually won the state election in central area of Hesse – but the party massively haemorrhaged support. Her Christian Democrats (CDU) came home first in Sunday's election in the western state of Hesse but support fell by more than 11 points, reigniting a succession debate by conservatives unhappy with the chancellor's grip on power. According to German newspaper Spiegel Online Merkel was planning to run for the chairmanship in December but the party’s hammering in Hesse elections last night has apparently changed her mind. The paper said: “CDU leader Angela Merkel will not stand again for the chairmanship of her party. This she announced after SPIEGEL information in the presidium meeting on Monday morning.\n\nMerkel quits: Angela Merkel has been the CDU party leader since 2000\n\n“According to her original plans, she wanted to compete again at the party congress in Hamburg in December. “Merkel now draws consequences from the downward trend of the CDU, shown at the state election in Hesse.” During the last Hesse election in 2013, CDU polled just 28 percent of the vote – down more than 10 percent from the 38.3 percent. News that Mrs Merkel would not seek the party chair again came as a shock to many CDU officials who believed the party's result in Hesse could have been worse. Prior to the announcement, Mrs Merkel was also contending with pressure from her Social Democrat (SPD) junior coalition partners, who bled support in Hesse and are under pressure to rethink their alliance with the German leader. SPD leader Andrea Nahles, whose party saw support fall to its lowest since 1946, also threatened to end the alliance with Mrs Merkel's conservatives if there is no improvement on policy.\n\nMerkel quits: The CDU suffered a disaster in last night's Hesse elections\n\nThe euro fell to session lows on the news. The news will distract her from tending to major challenges at home and abroad - ranging from overcoming a digital deficit and pushing the German car industry toward cleaner mobility to seeing through euro zone reforms and managing Britain's Brexit. Her weakness at home may also limit her capacity to lead in the EU at a time when the bloc is dealing with Brexit, a budget crisis in Italy and the prospect of populist parties making gains at European parliament elections next May. AfD leader Alexander Gauland, said the far right party had contributed to Mrs Merkel's loss of power in the CDU. Mr Gauland said in Berlin: \"This has a lot to do with us.\" Mrs Merkel authority has already been dented this year by the two regional election setbacks and a close ally losing his role as leader of her conservatives' parliamentary group. Mrs Merkel has loomed large on the European stage since 2005, helping guide the EU through the euro zone crisis and opening Germany's doors to migrants fleeing war in the Middle East in 2015 - a move that still divides the bloc and Germany.\n\nMerkel quits: Angela Merkel became CDU party leader in 2000",

        "text": "Zurich's \"Gold Coast\" lost half of its former lump sum tax foreigners when the system was scrapped (RDB)\n\nSome of Switzerland’s wealthy foreign residents have been packing up and leaving towns that have done away with favourable tax perks. With lump sum taxation going to a nationwide vote in November, how much money do tax-friendly cantons stand to lose?\n\nStudded with luxury villas and serviced by a yacht club, a Michelin-starred restaurant and other high class amenities, the sun-kissed slopes of Küsnacht that rise up along lake Zurich’s ‘Gold Coast’ are a magnet for well-heeled Swiss and foreign residents.\n\nBut such attractions were not enough for some of Küsnacht’s foreign residents, who left once canton Zurich voted to abolish their ‘lump sum’ tax perks in 2009. The same scene could be observed throughout the canton, with around half of the ‘lump sum’ beneficiaries deciding to make themselves scarce once the system disappeared.\n\nAn initiative on scrapping lump sum tax nationwide on November 30 could bring the same results, perhaps an even greater exodus from Switzerland as no canton would be able to offer the modest rates that have been labelled socially-unjust by critics.\n\nThe 5,634 lump sum tax residents in Switzerland could soon face a choice: do you want to stay for stunning scenery, political stability, low crime rates and relative anonymity – or for a simple, low-cost tax system that ignores overseas earnings by typically charging a flat annual levy of between five and seven times the rental value of your property?\n\nKüsnacht had 19 lump sum tax beneficiaries in 2009, and now 13 of them have left. But the affluent community has hardly noticed their passing, according to Mayor Markus Ernst.\n\n“When 13 residents leave out of a community of 13,000 it doesn’t make much of a difference,” he told swissinfo.ch. “Last year we observed around 1,290 people arriving and 1,147 leaving our community for a variety of reasons.”\n\n“The loss of these foreign residents has had little impact financially as they were not our biggest tax contributors by the very nature of the lump sum system,” he added. “They are international, highly mobile people who did not have deep roots in the community.”\n\nAdding up the numbers\n\nZurich has also weathered the loss of celebrity residents after becoming the first of five cantons to end the lump sum tax scheme five years ago.\n\nOf the canton’s 201 former lump sum beneficiaries 97 cleared off, mostly to other cantons but some out of Switzerland altogether (two also passed away). The departing individuals took CHF12.2 million in cantonal tax receipts with them.\n\nThis left over 100 wealthy foreigners remaining in the canton. Depending on how much wealth they had and how it was distributed, 55 ended up paying more tax and 47 less. Their total cantonal tax bill of CHF13.8 million more than made up for the losses, so the canton did better than break even.\n\nBut the financial contribution of such wealthy foreigners does not end there, according to opponents of November’s initiative. They inject far greater sums into local economies by buying and maintaining properties, employing local business for a range of services, eating out, buying yachts and cars from local dealers and attracting their rich friends on holiday.\n\nFurthermore, the loss of wealthy foreign residents would have a disproportionately adverse effect on cantons that could not fill the wealth gap left by departing rich residents as easily as Zurich - Switzerland’s financial centre.\n\nDisproportionate effect?\n\nCantons Vaud (with 1,396 lump sum tax residents), Valais (1,300) and Ticino (877) appear to have more to fear from the vote. According to Credit Suisse the 268 lump sum residents in Graubünden contribute a relatively high 3% of total tax receipts while Geneva (710) is nervously awaiting changes to corporate tax laws - forced by the European Union - that could further reduce revenues.\n\nVaud, which was the first canton to introduce the lump sum tax system in 1862, predicts dire consequences if lump sum tax is abolished across the whole of Switzerland.\n\n“It is quite possible that more than half of these residents could leave Valais, and perhaps Switzerland, if lump sum tax is abolished,” Maurice Tornay, Valais finance director, told swissinfo.ch. “In addition to the CHF84 million generated in communal, cantonal and federal taxes, these residents spend up to CHF200 million on properties and CHF150 million on other local services.”\n\nThe construction industry in rural cantons has already been hit by a vote two years ago to restrict the number of holiday homes being built in Switzerland, according to Toni Amonn, a tax advisor at the consultancy Relocation Switzerland.\n\n“Wealthy foreigners who come to live in Switzerland invest significant sums in property,” Amonn told swissinfo.ch. “There is clearly an opportunity to attract people who will build a relatively small number of high value properties and live in them, thus avoiding the problem of cold beds in holiday regions.”\n\n“There is a grave danger that this opportunity will go down the drain because it is clear that demand from wealthy foreign individuals who want to come to Switzerland will slow down if lump sum tax is abolished. There are other countries in Europe, such as Britain, that could offer more attractive tax conditions for foreign residents.”\n\nBreath of fresh air\n\nNobody knows how many foreign residents will pack their bags if the lump sum tax system is abolished in Switzerland. For example, Küsnacht retained such an enduring appeal for Tina Turner that she recently renounced her US passport to become a Swiss citizen despite losing lump sum tax privileges.\n\n“The priority is the fresh air. It’s the lushness of the green,” she told Blick newspaper on being asked why she is staying.\n\nIf the experience of Zurich is anything to go by, others are bound to leave to find a better financial deal elsewhere. Voters will have to decide if the lump sum tax system is an invaluable and reliable source of income to be enjoyed by all or an unjust, anachronistic tax scheme that panders to the rich.\n\nLump sum tax in numbers\n\nThe lump sum (or forfait) tax system was first introduced in Canton Vaud in 1862 to cope with the rising number of wealthy foreigners (mainly British) who were settling there. The system neatly sidestepped the need to calculate the often complicated wealth, income and tax arrangements of such individuals that could be spread over many countries. Other cantons soon adopted similar programmes. According to the Conference of Cantonal Finance Directors, there were some 3,106 lump sum residents living in Switzerland in 1999. This increased to 5,003 in 2008 and 5,634 by the end of 2012 (latest figure). The rate of increase has slowed from 47.4% between 2006 and 2008 to 4% between 2010 and 2012. In 2012 the lowest amount paid by any lump sum individual was CHF10,000, the highest was CHF8,230,326. The average payment was CHF123,358 (up from CHF94,549 in 2006). end of infobox\n\nHow the lump sum tax system works The lump sum tax system places a levy on the living expenses of wealthy foreign residents, whilst ignoring their overseas earnings and wealth. It is only available to people who do not conduct any business activity inside Switzerland. Sports stars and artists can also benefit from the system. In 2012, the government decided to tighten up the lump sum tax rules in the face of growing opposition to the system from Swiss voters. From the start of 2016 lump sum beneficiaries must be charged at least seven times the rental value of their property at federal and cantonal level (this raises the level from five times the rental value of property at present, although some cantons have already raised the minimum levy bar). To qualify for federal lump sum treatment, foreign residents will also have to prove a minimum income of CHF400,000 ($420,000). For example, a foreigner who buys a property in Switzerland that has a rental value of 5,000 per month will pay a minimum tax of CHF420,000 (CHFF5,000 x 12 x7). Other expenses, such as cars, yachts and school fees may also come into account when calculating the annual tax charge. Lump sum tax can be claimed by foreigners coming to the country for the first time or returning to Switzerland after an absence of at least 10 years. end of infobox\n\nswissinfo.ch\n\nNeuer Inhalt Horizontal Line\n\nLike swissinfo.ch?

        "text": "Der entsprechende Paragraf steht seit 2008 im Ausländergesetz und ermöglicht es grundsätzlich allen Erdenbürgern, ihren Wohnsitz in die Schweiz zu verlegen. Nach fünf Jahren kann die B-Bewilligung in eine C-Bewilligung umgewandelt werden, die es den Besitzern erlaubt, dauerhaft in der Schweiz zu bleiben.\n\nMöglich macht den Handel mit den Aufenthaltsbewilligungen der Absatz b im Artikel 30 des Ausländergesetzes. Dieser hält fest, dass unter Umständen von den geltenden Zulassungsvoraussetzungen für eine Aufenthaltsbewilligung abgesehen werden kann, wenn damit «wichtigen öffentlichen Interessen» Rechnung getragen wird. Bereits 2014 gab das Bundesamt für Migration (SEM) bekannt, dass dieses «öffentliche Interesse» erfüllt sei, wenn «erhebliche fiskalische Interessen» bestünden. Sprich: Wer seinem gewünschten Wohnkanton finanziellen Segen bringt, für den macht man hierzulande gerne eine Ausnahme bei den ansonsten strengen Anforderungen für die «B-Bewilligungen».\n\nDer Fall tönt spektakulär. Dabei geht rasch vergessen, dass reiche Ausländer auch aus Nicht-EU-Staaten seit Jahren ganz legal an Aufenthaltsbewilligungen für die Schweiz kommen können – und dass die Kantone dabei gut verdienen. In anderen Ländern kann sogar die Staatsbürgerschaft erworben werden – was nicht ganz günstig ist.\n\nAm Dienstag klickten im Tessin die Handschellen. Mehrere aktuelle und ehemalige Mitarbeiter des kantonalen Migrationsamtes haben mutmasslich illegal Aufenthaltsbewilligungen an Firmen vermittelt, die damit ausländische Arbeiter in die Schweiz holten. Die Bewilligungs-Dealer sorgen landesweit für Diskussionen.\n\n523 Ausländer haben bis Ende 2016 von dem Paragrafen Gebrauch gemacht und eine Aufenthaltsbewilligung für die Schweiz erhalten, wie das SEM auf Anfrage der «Nordwestschweiz» bekannt gibt. Mit 165 erteilten Aufenthaltsbewilligungen führen die Russen die Liste an. Auf dem zweiten Platz folgen türkische Staatsangehörige, die insgesamt 36 Aufenthaltsbewilligungen erhielten. Auch 21 Amerikaner, 20 Kanadier, 17 Brasilianer, 16 Serben und 15 Ukrainer waren von «wichtigem öffentlichem Interesse».\n\n23 Kantone haben bereits mindestens einmal von der Ausnahmeregelung Gebrauch gemacht. Mit 200 erteilten Aufenthaltsbewilligungen steht das Tessin an erster Stelle, gefolgt von Genf (91), Zürich (41), Zug (33), dem Kanton Waadt (30), Obwalden (22) und dem Wallis (20). Der Kanton Aargau hat 4 entsprechende Bewilligungen ausgestellt, Basel-Stadt 11 und Baselland 5. Der Kanton Solothurn ist neben den beiden Appenzell der einzige Kanton, der keine Ausländer von «wichtigem öffentlichem Interesse» beheimatet.\n\nSeit 2013 haben auch vier Staatsbürger von St. Kitts & Nevis eine Schweizer B-Bewilligung erhalten. Der Inselstaat geriet 2014 in die Schlagzeilen, weil Kanada den Besitzern des karibischen Passes den visafreien Zutritt verweigerte. Die Begründung der kanadischen Behörden: St. Kitts & Nevis verkaufe seine Staatszugehörigkeit auch an reiche Investoren, die in illegale Finanzgeschäfte verwickelt sind. St. Kitts & Nevis sprach damals von «Einzelfällen». Wer die St.-Kitts-&-Nevis-Bürger mit Schweizer Aufenthaltsbewilligung sind, ist nicht bekannt.\n\nBekannt ist aber, dass das karabische Steuerparadies Mitte der 80er-Jahre eines der ersten Länder der Welt war, die in den käuflichen Pässen ein Geschäft erkannten und ihre Staatszugehörigkeit zum käuflichen Gut erklärten. Für 250'000 Dollar kann sich jeder den karibischen Pass kaufen – ohne den Inselstaat je besuchen zu müssen und ohne allzu genau durchleuchtet zu werden.\n\n50'000 Franken für eine B-Bewilligung\n\nDie Schweiz ist bei weitem nicht der einzige Staat, der es reichen Ausländern einfach macht, sich im Land niederzulassen. Rund die Hälfte aller EU-Staaten und zahlreiche andere Länder haben sogenannte «Investment Migration Programs», mit denen sie guten Steuerzahlern vereinfachten Zugang zu Aufenthaltsbewilligungen verschaffen. Anders als in der Schweiz legen die meisten Länder mit entsprechenden Programmen ganz offiziell fest, was die «goldenen Visa» kosten. In Kanada muss man 800 000 kanadische Dollar investieren, in den USA 500 000 Dollar (in «riskante Projekte»), in Portugal muss man 350 000 Euro in Bauprojekte stecken, in Irland 500 000 Euro hinblättern und in Hongkong umgerechnet 1,3 Millionen Dollar bezahlen.\n\nNeuerdings macht auch Italien mit beim einträglichen Geschäft mit den Aufenthaltsbewilligungen. Das Parlament hat im Dezember ein entsprechendes Gesetz verabschiedet, das im März in Kraft treten soll. Das Heimatrecht im Bel paese ist allerdings kein Schnäppchen. Wer sich als Nicht-EU-Bürger hier niederlassen will, muss zwei Millionen Euro in Staats- oder Unternehmensanleihen investieren, eine Million für ein der Öffentlichkeit dienliches Projekt zahlen oder ein Start-up mit einer Finanzspritze von 500 000 Euro unterstützen.\n\nDazu kommen die Gebühren, die spezialisierte Firmen wie Premiere Offshore, Henley & Partners, Arton Capital oder Elma Global für die Vermittlung verlangen. Letztere helfen vermögenden Kunden laut ihrer Homepage gerne auch bei den Verhandlungen mit den Schweizer Behörden. Ins Geschäft kommt man ab 50'000 Franken.\n\nIn diesen 13 Ländern gibt es legal die Staatsbürgerschaft zu kaufen:",

        "text": "GetUp is making a grassroots, issues-based bid to oust the home affairs minister from his safe Queensland seat\n\nAnthony Smith is blunt in his explanation for why he wants his local MP Peter Dutton out of the parliament.\n\n“I don’t like racism,” he told the Guardian. “I think some of the things he has said have crossed that line. The things he’s said about refugees, one of the most vulnerable groups in our society.”\n\nSmith, a 45-year-old engineer from Queensland, says he has never been a member of a political party or “even been to a rally”, but he’s part of a hardcore group of activists plotting the political downfall of the Liberal party’s rightwing standard bearer.\n\nOn Saturday, the left-leaning activist group GetUp will formally launch its campaign to dislodge Dutton from the seat of Dickson after amassing a $225,000 warchest from its members.\n\nIt might seem a far-fetched prospect given Dutton’s status. Often touted as a future prime minister, the former Queensland cop’s role overseeing Australia’s strict border control policies have made him a source of hatred for the left but a galvanising figure on the right-flank of the Liberal party.\n\nBut Dutton’s position in Dickson is not as secure as his influence within the party.\n\nThe home affairs minister suffered a 5.12% swing against him at the last election, leaving him with a slim 1.6% margin. A recent redistribution improved his position slightly, but GetUp predict that it would only take another 1,500 voters to change their mind for him to lose the seat.\n\nPeter Dutton: 'Some leaders fall into the trap of abandoning principles' Read more\n\nThe real question though is whether GetUp can hit the right note in its campaign to unseat a man that its national director Paul Oosting believes is “more powerful than the prime minister”.\n\n\n\nDutton’s status as an emblem of loathing for the left in Australia has been long cultivated.\n\nFrom his decision to boycott the historic 2007 apology to the stolen generations, through to his claims while overseeing Australia’s indefinite offshore detention of refugees that white South African farmers were “persecuted” and could be given fast-track Australian visas, there is no shortage of material for GetUp to motivate their base.\n\nBut a senior Liberal National party source in Queensland told the Guardian that Dickson was “an issues-driven community” and that GetUp would need to find out what was making voters in Brisbane’s north-west tick.\n\n“His neck of the woods has been quite conservative, but there are a lot of new people who have moved in there who are not as conservative, and don’t care so much about those conservative touchstones,” the source said.\n\n“Whether that is enough to knock him off or not, is the unknown. But it is an issues driven community – and what issue is GetUp running that is going to impact those people’s lives? That they just don’t like him? You never know how much shit they’ll throw, but ‘I don’t like him’ is not an issue. So, we don’t know, and we can just wait and see.”\n\nDutton himself previously told the Guardian that GetUp’s campaign was “certainly something we seek to overcome”.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A GetUp billboard targeting Tony Abbott’s policies in 2010. Photograph: Paul Miller/AAP\n\n“In 2007 in the WorkChoices campaign, the unions were on the ground full time for months and GetUp had a huge presence at the last election in Dickson. So it just means we need to adapt, we need to raise more money than them, we need to get greater resources and we’re in the process of doing that.”\n\nHe has confidently said that the leftwing group’s presence in his electorate helped him amass some $600,000 in donations, and Oosting says he’s been surprised by the level of pushback from the Liberal party since GetUp announced that it would focus its 2019 campaign on unseating Dutton.\n\nIn recent weeks conservative Tasmanian senator Eric Abetz has asked the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to investigate the left-leaning activist group’s legal status. It follows his push for the Australian Electoral Commission to classify the group as an “associated entity” of Labor or the Greens meaning it would have to disclose donors.\n\nTo fight back, GetUp is relying on locals such as Anthony Smith to energise swinging voters. A poster for the group’s launch on Saturday says the event will “not be a ‘listen to speeches’ launch”.\n\n“We want to share our ideas and hear about yours,” it reads.\n\nNSW election funding caps to 'stifle' advocacy groups and 'distort democracy' Read more\n\nIn practice, that may mean focusing less on the issues that matter to progressive voters in Sydney and Melbourne – namely, immigration – and instead figuring out what will make those 1,500 voters in Brisbane’s north-west change their vote.\n\n“That’s one of the reasons why we’re starting from a really community-led campaign,” Oosting said.\n\n“We’re trying to make sure we’re attuned to what the wider voters in Dickson care about.”\n\nFor his part, the GetUp director says he’s not underestimating the challenge.\n\n“There was a fairly significant swing against him last time which we contributed to somewhat which means it will be harder to move it this time,” he said.\n\n“That final group of voters will play more to Dutton’s strengths because traditionally swing voters are less politically engaged [and] he has the combination of huge amounts of money to spend and a big media profile.”",

        "text": "Peter Dutton says reduction by more than 20,000 migrants caused by weeding out of ‘fraudulent claims’\n\nAustralia accepted just 162,417 permanent migrants in the past year, a decrease of more than 10% on the previous year and the lowest level in a decade.\n\nThe reduction, confirmed by the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, on Friday, was the result of a departmental crackdown after Dutton and former prime minister Tony Abbott unsuccessfully advocated for a lower migration cap, prompting accusations the government has cut migration by “backdoor means”.\n\nThe results were criticised by Migration Council Australia, which warned cabinet should set the migration level, while a reduction in numbers could slow economic growth.\n\nAustralians are getting poorer - but it has nothing to do with immigrants | Tom Westland Read more\n\nIn May a group of peak bodies coordinated a broad alliance including the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Industry Group that called for the permanent migration intake to remain at 190,000.\n\nThe Ai Group chief executive, Innes Willox, said although the migration intake often falls short of the cap, it was “disappointing” that migration levels had dropped “so significantly below the 2017-18 intake”.\n\nIn April the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry also accused the government of “reducing the permanent migration intake by backdoor means by closing off legitimate access to the skills that business needs through slow processing, reducing eligible occupations and significantly increasing regulation and costs”.\n\nSince 2012 Australia has maintained an annual cap of 190,000 on permanent migration, roughly divided into two-thirds skilled work visas and one-third family reunion visas.\n\nWe want to make sure particularly that, say, people coming through the spousal program are [in] legitimate relationships Peter Dutton\n\nOn Friday the Australian reported the home affairs department issued 12,500 fewer skilled work visas and there was a 15% reduction in family visas last financial year. The figures have not been publicly released by the government.\n\nDutton confirmed the reduction of more than 20,000 migrants and said the intake was the “lowest ... we’ve seen since John Howard was prime minister”.\n\nThe reduction was caused by the department “looking more closely at the applications that are made” to weed out “fraudulent claims” such as migrants overstating their qualifications, he told Channel Nine’s Today program.\n\n“We want to make sure particularly that, say, people coming through the spousal program are [in] legitimate relationships,” the minister said.\n\nLabor frontbencher Anthony Albanese said the drop was a “good result”.\n\n“Of course it’s a good result, if there is more integrity in the system,” he told Today.\n\nThe chief executive of the Migration Council, Carla Wilshire, told Guardian Australia the level of migration “has traditionally been a cabinet decision because the migration program is a critical economic leaver of government”.\n\n“Migration affects workforce capacity and business confidence, and the decision to reduce the flow has implications across portfolios, including for the budget bottom line,” she said.\n\n“Dropping the migration numbers has the potential to slow economic growth and undermine business confidence.”\n\nDear America, we can teach you a few things about cruelty to refugees. Love, Australia | Brigid Delaney Read more\n\nWillox said “to the government’s credit”, despite the drop in numbers, the proportion of skilled migration was maintained in 2017-18 – slightly higher than the previous year at 68.4% of the intake.\n\nIn February the treasurer, Scott Morrison, warned that a reduction of 80,000 migrants – as Abbott proposes – would cost the budget $1bn a year and amount to “cutting off your nose to spite your face”.\n\nIn April Dutton and Malcolm Turnbull were at odds about a report that the home affairs minister had proposed reducing the cap to 170,000, but the idea was quashed by the prime minister and the treasurer.\n\nTurnbull declared the report “false” and “completely untrue”, but Dutton then contradicted the prime minister by essentially confirming that he had discussed the issue with colleagues.\n\nOn Friday the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, told Sky News the cap had remained at 190,000 since 2012, but it is a “ceiling ... not a target”.\n\n“It really depends on the quality of the applicants, as to whether or not you can reach that cap or you don’t reach that cap,” he said.\n\n“The number is ultimately what it is after all of the criteria have been properly applied and applicants have been properly scrutinised.”",

        "text": "Peter Dutton says a recent drop in the number of migrants settling permanently in Australia will be positive for the economy, contradicting Scott Morrison’s arguments that lower immigration levels cost the budget.\n\n\n\nIt was revealed last week that 162,417 people permanently migrated to Australia in 2017-18 – well under the 190,000 cap and down from 183,608 the year before.\n\nThe Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has expressed concern about the development, arguing the Turnbull government is “effectively throttling back the rate of migration by stealth”.\n\nRegional Australia 'victim' of populist migration cut, key industry figure says Read more\n\nThe ACCI’s chief executive, James Pearson, said last week there were “plenty of studies ... which demonstrate that strong, well-planned and controlled migration drives economic growth”.\n\nA report last December from the London-based Centre for Economics and Business Research found population growth would help propel Australia to become the world’s 11th biggest economy – jumping two places – within a decade.\n\nEarlier this year, the treasurer warned that a proposal by the former prime minister Tony Abbott to slash migration by 80,000 people would cost the budget $4bn to $5bn over four years.\n\nBut asked on Sunday about the economic impact of a drop of about 20,000 migrants on his watch, the home affairs minister told Sky News “it is a positive one because if we’re bringing more productive people in, then there’s more economic benefit for our country and there’s also greater societal benefit as well”.\n\nDutton said tightening up the program meant “we’re actually bringing more productive people in because we’re not bringing people in who have made false claims”.\n\nIndustry brands Australia's 10% migration intake drop 'disappointing' Read more\n\n“We’re an ageing population,” he said. “I want people to come in with the requisite skills if we can’t find an Australian to fill those jobs. And I want those people to be paying tax as long as they can if they’re of working age and have a capacity to work, because that’s where the economic productivity and benefit is for our country.”\n\nMigration is always a politically sensitive subject but the issue has returned as a front-and-centre political debate around the world in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.\n\nWhile Australia largely avoided the sustained economic downturn that has helped make migration a political flashpoint in Europe, the United States and the United Kingdom, Abbott has been campaigning for the past couple of years to cut Australia’s migration levels.\n\nDutton also suggested in February that Australia should reduce its intake of migrants “where we believe it’s in our national interest”.\n\nAbbott in February advocated a target of 110,000 migrants a year, down from 190,000, prompting Morrison to say at the time: “If you cut the level of permanent immigration to Australia by 80,000, that would cost the budget, that would hit the bottom line, the deficit, by $4bn to $5bn over the next four years.\n\n“If you did what Tony Abbott suggests, then you would only reduce the proportion that was skilled migration and you’d have a bigger proportion which was family migration – which ultimately gets more dependent on welfare.”\n\nDutton said he was focussed on applying extra scrutiny to the migration program, which also involved “cancelling visas at a record rate of non-citizens who have committed criminal offences against Australians” in an effort to restore public faith in the system.\n\nThe home affairs minister was also asked whether the Turnbull government would ever take up an offer from New Zealand to take asylum seekers currently detained on Nauru and Manus Island.\n\nDutton said 314 of the detainees had been taken to the US under an agreement struck between the government and the former Obama administration. He said it was possible the New Zealand offer could be considered “if we’re down to a trickle of people within Manus or within Nauru”.\n\nHe said that, at some stage in the future, if the law was changed “so that those people couldn’t come to Australia, you might consider it – but it’s a dangerous contemplation at the moment”.",

        "text": "The European Union’s top court has dismissed complaints by Slovakia and Hungary about EU migration policy, dealing a blow to the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, and his allies in central Europe over the bitterly contested policy of refugee quotas.\n\n\n\nIn an important victory for the EU, judges threw out a challenge against its mandatory relocation scheme, which aims to relocate 120,000 asylum seekers around the bloc.\n\n\n\nThe victory has sharpened tensions between the EU and Hungary’s combative PM, who has made opposition to EU asylum policy a core theme of his “Stop Brussels” campaign. It will also raise tensions with Poland, which lent its support to the failed legal campaign.\n\nBudapest condemned the court ruling as “appalling and irresponsible”. The foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said: “This decision jeopardises the security and future of all of Europe. Politics has raped European law and values.”\n\nThe European court of justice (ECJ) said it had dismissed “in their entirety the actions brought by Slovakia and Hungary”, vindicating the EU decision-making process that created a scheme to relocate 120,000 asylum seekers from Greece and Italy to other member states.\n\nThe number was later amended when 54,000 “unused places” were allocated to resettle Syrian refugees in Turkey in Europe. Based on the original 120,000 figure, fewer than a quarter of places have been filled. With the relocation scheme due to expire later this month, the stage is set for bruising arguments over permanent refugee quotas.\n\nEU leaders agreed the emergency plan in September 2015, at the height of the migration crisis, as thousands of people arrived daily on Europe’s shores, many of whom were refugees from Syria, Iraq and Eritrea.\n\nAlong with Hungary and Slovakia, Romania and the Czech Republic also voted against the scheme. Poland belatedly threw its weight behind the legal case after the conservative Law and Justice party came to power in late 2015.\n\n\n\nEuropean leaders turned to an untested provision of the EU treaty to force through the decision in an attempt to get to grips with unprecedented numbers of people arriving in the EU.\n\nECJ judges said the European council had acted lawfully. EU institutions were on firm legal ground when they adopted measures to respond to “an emergency situation characterised by a sudden inflow of displaced persons”, the court said. The ECJ also concluded that the legality of the decision was not affected by retrospective conclusions about the policy’s effectiveness.\n\n\n\nIn a robust defence of the EU treaties, the court said: “The small number of relocations so far carried out under the contested decision can be explained by a series of factors … including, in particular, the lack of cooperation on the part of certain member states.”\n\nData released on Wednesday shows that 27,695 refugees have been relocated under the scheme, roughly two-thirds from Greece and a third from Italy. Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner for migration, said there was “misunderstanding” about the numbers and fewer people than anticipated were eligible for help.\n\nHe said 2,800 people in Greece were awaiting relocation and another 2,000 were expected to become eligible. According to official data, in Italy 7,200 eligible asylum seekers have arrived since the start of the year but only 4,000 have been registered, as authorities struggle to cope with arrivals.\n\n\n\nHungary and Poland have not relocated a single person and the Czech Republic has not made any offers for more than a year. All three countries risk being taken to court by the commission. Avramopoulos said the commission was ready to consider that last step. “The door is still open and we should convince all member states to fulfil their commitments, but we should be clear that member states have to show solidarity now.”\n\nThe court decision came as the EU executive curtly dismissed Orbán’s request for EU funds to help build a border fence. In a letter from the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, Orbán is chastised for attempting to pick and choose EU policies. “Solidarity is not an à-la-carte dish,” states the letter, first obtained by Politico.\n\n\n\nJuncker lists the financial support Hungary has received to manage migrant flows, and the €4m Budapest lost out on by refusing to take part in the refugee relocation scheme. “Solidarity is a two-way street. There are times in which member states may expect to receive support, and times in which they, in turn, should stand ready to contribute,” he writes.\n\nThe ECJ ruling was greeted with relief in Brussels. Manfred Weber, the head of the European parliament’s largest centre-right group, tweeted:\n\nManfred Weber (@ManfredWeber) #ECJ confirms our view on the migration scheme. We expect all EU countries to respect and implement the ruling. @EPPGroup 1/3\n\nThere was a predictable reaction from anti-EU parties. The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: “What a surprise – EU court undermines national sovereignty once again. It should be a decision of nation states who it allows inside its borders.”\n\nThe EU has taken in more than 1.7 million people from the Middle East and Africa since 2014. However, after a mass influx in 2015, the number of arrivals has fallen steadily after actions last year that all but closed the route from Turkey to Greece and from Greece to the Balkans and northern Europe. The EU has also increased support for Libya to curb arrivals in Italy.\n\nThe ruling has no impact on the UK, which has an opt-out from this area of EU law.\n\n",

        "text": "Hungary has said it will resist any EU-wide attempt to strip it of its right to protect its borders and will fight to overturn the pro-migration policies of the centre-right grouping to which it belongs in the European parliament.\n\nThe prime minister, Viktor Orbán, was isolated last week when a majority of MEPs from the European People’s Party (EPP) grouping helped form the two-thirds parliamentary majority required to start a sanctions procedure against Hungary for repeatedly breaching EU laws. The procedure could result in fines or a loss of voting rights.\n\nIn an address to the Hungarian parliament Orbán claimed that a proposal for a 10,000-strong EU border force, which will be discussed at a summit in Salzburg this week, was an attempt to strip nation states of their right to defend their borders.\n\nOrbán’s chief spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, went further, saying Hungary would resist any EU-wide migration reform that was proposed before European parliament elections in May.\n\nMany EU countries were still determined to meet their labour market needs by allowing hundreds of thousands of people into Europe every year, Kovacs said, adding that “a pro-migration globalist political elite” was trying to shut down options for after the European parliament elections. “We should not decide on EU-wide migration issues at an EU level until after the elections,” he said.\n\nOn Sunday Michael Gove, the UK environment minister, refused to criticise Hungary’s illiberal leader and his country’s hardline migration policies, hinting in a BBC interview that the UK needed Hungary’s support as part of the Brexit process.\n\nConservative MEPs drew fierce criticism last week when they voted against disciplinary proceedings against Hungary for breaching EU values on migration, media freedom and judicial independence.\n\nHowever, in a blow to Orbán, the Austrian president, Sebastian Kurz, and the leader of the European People’s Party group, Manfred Weber, deserted Hungary on the vote. Weber, eager to prevent the EPP from splitting, called on EU leaders at the weekend to discuss the Hungary crisis at their informal summit in Salzburg this week, a move welcomed by Kovacs.\n\nKovacs said Orbán would resist any efforts in Salzburg to change the EU’s immigration and asylum laws until after European parliament elections in May, when it is expected that more anti-migration MEPs will be elected.\n\n“The global elite still believe it is in the west’s interest to permit hundreds of thousands of migrants every year,” Kovacs said. “It is impossible that we have to follow the French or Germans.”\n\nA plan by the European commission, the EU’s executive body, for a 10,000-strong EU border force to police Europe’s borders would weaken national sovereignty and the right of nation states to police their own borders, Kovacs said. “The commission plan is not going to happen,” he added.\n\nKovacs admitted the loss of support from within the EPP had not been a “pleasant experience” but said it showed “that pro-migration policies are not simply a leftist liberal agenda”.\n\nAlthough more than half the EPP group voted to discipline Hungary, he said the relatively narrow majority within the EPP explained why Orbán’s party, Fidesz, wanted to stay in the group and bring about policy changes.\n\nHe predicted that the composition of theEuropean parliament “will look very different after the elections”. Some EPP members want to expel Fidesz, saying it has more in common with far-right populist parties than the EPP’s Christian Democrat tradition.",

Read more\n\nMigration is high on the agenda of the two-day summit, which opens on 28 June. EU leaders will attempt to reach a consensus on how to manage the thousands of refugees and migrants arriving each month.\n\n\n\nThe German and French leaders, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, met near Berlin on Tuesday to agree on a common approach, amid fears in their camps that the European project is unravelling.\n\nBefore the meeting France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Europe was “in a process of disintegration. We see states that are turning inward, trying to find national solutions to problems that require European solutions.”\n\n\n\nHe called for “a new European project” on immigration, as well as economic and financial issues, “to consolidate Europe in a world where you have the United States on one side, China on the other and we are trapped in the middle”.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the meeting, which was dominated by eurozone reform, Macron said the EU would “work with countries of origin and transit” to cut off illegal people-smuggling routes, and build “solidarity mechanisms, both externally and internally”. The EU border and coastguard agency Frontex would be expanded to become “a true European border police”.\n\nMerkel is under pressure from her hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, to come up with a European plan by the end of the month. Germany continues to receive more applications for asylum than any other EU member state. Seehofer wants German border guards to start turning people away if there is no EU-wide progress.\n\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the EU document’s proposal for “regional disembarkation platforms” would work, or where they might be set up.\n\nElizabeth Collett, the director of the Migration Policy Institute in Brussels, said it was a “watered-down version” of Austrian-Danish proposals that had called for arrivals in Europe to be sent back to their point of departure to have their claims processed.\n\n“What has clearly changed is the level of political backing for this,” she said.\n\nThe plan prompted questions about how it would work and the cost involved, she said. “It looks great on paper, but can you get countries to sign up from outside Europe and basically be vassal states?”\n\n\n\nThe other big problem was ensuring the centres met EU standards, she said. “The conditions, the processing, all of the things that require a high degree of knowledge and are quite hard to manage within the EU, these are big questions.”\n\nThe plan, however, appears to be helping unite EU countries that are deeply divided on migration.\n\nItaly and France support the idea of asylum centres outside EU territory, an idea that helped defuse diplomatic tensions after the two countries clashed when the new populist government in Rome refused to allow the docking of a ship carrying 630 migrants.\n\n\n\nMacron, who has previously raised the idea, proposed it when he met the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, last week.\n\nThe EU struck a deal with Turkey in 2016 that drastically reduced migrant flows, but the bloc has found it harder to work with north African governments, especially Libya, from where most sea crossings begin.\n\n\n\nThe European commission has rejected a Turkey-style deal with Libya because of instability in the country. But Italy’s previous government struck deals with Libyan militia and tribes and helped relaunch the Libyan coastguard. These actions contributed to a sharp reduction in the number of people crossing the central Mediterranean, but critics reported an increase in human rights violations.\n\n\n\nAccording to the draft document, the EU would like to set up the centres in collaboration with the UN refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration, a UN-related body that has previously criticised the paucity of legal routes for African migrants to travel to Europe.\n\n\n\nDimitris Avramopoulos, the EU migration commissioner, is expected to spell out details of the disembarkation centres later this week.",

        "text": "This week, representing the world’s largest humanitarian network, I will join several high-level UN general assembly discussions on migration. I will take every opportunity I can to press for actions to match words on safe, orderly and regular migration.\n\nUp for discussion will be the hard-won global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, the world’s first comprehensive road map to ensuring that all migrants, regardless of legal status, have access to the protection and assistance they need. Those who adopt it will have the support of 12 million Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers and staff, as well as many other organisations that are ready to help them turn their commitments into action.\n\nEarly September brought reports of dozens more women, men and children drowning in the Mediterranean after their flimsy and overcrowded boat capsized somewhere between Libya and Malta. Nearly 300 survivors, including pregnant women, babies, and people with serious burns and injuries, were eventually rescued by the Libyan coastguard and returned to Libya. There, they were placed in detention centres renowned for their horrible conditions.\n\nThis is the human consequence of a deal designed to slow the flow of migrants from Africa and the Middle East to Europe. In the meantime, independent rescue boats that have been safely delivering shipwrecked migrants to European harbours are now prohibited from doing so. As criminalising aid and skirting responsibility become more prevalent, it is no surprise that more than 1,700 migrants have perished or gone missing in the Mediterranean this year.\n\nThis, shamefully, is what migration looks like today along one of many dangerous routes that desperate people – migrants and refugees – feel compelled to take in order to escape war, disaster, exploitation, political crisis, persecution, poverty and other hardships.\n\nThis, unacceptably, is what is still happening even as governments champion managed and humane migration, at this week’s UN general assembly in New York and beyond. In December, these same leaders will hopefully adopt the critically important global migration compact and commit to protecting people on the move, treating them with dignity, ensuring access to vital assistance and expanding safe and legal pathways for them.\n\nThe rhetoric, sadly, does not yet match the reality. In remote desert towns of Niger, I met recently arrived migrants who were in dire straits. They were receiving little aid beyond the medical care delivered by the Red Cross and overstretched local services. Their grim choice is to remain there in the harshest of conditions or continue across the Sahara towards northern Africa. Neither option is acceptable or safe.\n\nThe UN estimates that more than 2.3 million people are on the move from Venezuela.

        "text": "German interior minister promises refugees will not be sent over Bavarian border to Austria as search for EU-wide deal continues\n\nThis article is more than 1 year old\n\nThis article is more than 1 year old\n\nGermany, Austria and Italy will hold talks on “closing” the southern migrant route to Europe, the German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, has announced, after he promised that refugees would not be sent over the Bavarian border to Austria.\n\nAt a hastily arranged meeting in Vienna with the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, Seehofer sought support from Germany’s southern neighbour for a controversial border agreement he had reached with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.\n\nSeehofer, whose hard line on immigration has prompted weeks of conflict with the chancellor, promised that Germany would not send asylum seekers to Austria if they were turned away at the German border, although details remained unclear.\n\n\n\nSeparately, Merkel said she wanted to protect Europe’s “humanity” in dealing with migrants, spelling out her differences with Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, at a press conference in Berlin.\n\nMerkel’s Christian Democratic Union party reached an agreement with its sister party, Seehofer’s Christian Social Union, to set up special transit centres at the German-Austrian border to process asylum claims. Germany also wants to reach bilateral deals with Greece and Italy so they take back asylum seekers.\n\nWhat is the current state of the migration crisis in Europe? Read more\n\nUnder EU rules, the first country of arrival is responsible for processing asylum claims, a system that has put a heavy burden on Mediterranean states and triggered angry debates about what to do with people who move to other member states.\n\nSeehofer predicted that talks with Greece and Italy about these so-called secondary movements of people would be “extremely complex and complicated”.\n\nAustria had feared that Germany was exporting these asylum claimants, prompting Kurz to warn that he could introduce controls along the southern border.\n\n“These national measures would of course affect Austria and would mean that we would have to take measures along our southern border,” Kurz said hours before meeting Seehofer. “We are fighting for a European solution.”\n\nAfter the meeting, Kurz said “things had been cleared up now”, but acknowledged that there would be a “period of uncertainty” while Germany sought to negotiate agreements on returns with Greece and Italy.\n\nUnder pressure from the CSU, Merkel has been scrambling to get an EU-wide solution, fearing that there will be a domino effect if Germany takes unilateral action, leading to border closures across central Europe and unravelling the EU’s border-free travel zone, imposing costs on people and businesses.\n\nAustria has been considering imposing controls at the Brenner Pass, one of Europe’s busiest transport hubs, on its southern border with Italy. If vehicles had to detour through the Gotthard tunnel in Switzerland, Austrian officials estimate it would add €124 (£110) to the cost of each journey.\n\n\n\nAustria, which took over the EU’s rotating presidency on 1 July, wants to strengthen the EU’s external borders while avoiding internal controls on the continent.\n\n\n\nKurz said “major progress” on external borders had been made at a recent summit in Brussels of EU leaders as he sought to dispel doubts about the vague communique that was agreed.\n\nAfter all-night talks, EU leaders agreed that unspecified non-EU countries should host migrant-processing centres to try to prevent people risking their lives making dangerous sea crossings to Europe. Kurz said he was “convinced there are countries that are willing to work with us in the spirit of partnership”, though he did not name them.\n\nUnder Kurz’s leadership, the Austrian People’s party entered into a coalition with the far-right anti-immigrant Freedom party last December. That coalition, backed by Denmark, recently called for failed asylum seekers to be expelled from the EU to camps in the Balkans.\n\nDiplomatic convention requires the holder of the EU presidency not to push pet projects but to act as an honest broker for all EU countries. Kurz indicated it would not be possible to push the idea of camps in non-EU countries during the next six months.\n\n\n\n“To be honest, I do not want to elaborate on this idea because we do not want to endanger it,” he said, adding it was “not connected to the Austrian presidency but it might serve as an example for others”.\n\nAustria has become an enthusiastic supporter of a long-standing effort by the European commission to create a European border and coastguard agency, in contrast to the policy of previous Austrian governments. Kurz called for the agency to have 10,000 border guards by 2020, seven years earlier than anticipated by Brussels.\n\n",

The latter won, but fell short of a majority.\n\nThe People’s party’s 31-year-old foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz, becomes the country’s new chancellor, and Heinz-Christian Strache, the head of the Freedom party, his deputy.\n\n\n\nKurz’s party will run ministries including finance, justice and agriculture, a conservative spokesman said.\n\nThe Freedom party, which is anti-immigration, will control the foreign, interior and defence ministries and others, he said.\n\n\n\nFollowing meetings with Kurz and Strache, Van der Bellen said he’d been assured the new government would be pro-European. “In these talks among other things we agreed it is in the national interest of Austria to remain at the centre of a strong European Union and to actively participate in the future development of the European Union,” he said.\n\nIt is not the first time the Freedom party has been in government. It was part of a coalition government between 2000 and 2005. There was uproar at the time among EU leaders, and bilateral diplomatic relations were frozen in protest.\n\nThe response this time is likely to be more muted, given the increased support for other rightwing populist parties across Europe. Similar parties have not, however, had the same success. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s Front National, lost in May’s presidential election and the Dutch anti-immigration Freedom party of Geert Wilders was defeated.\n\nStrache has moved to clean up the party’s image by suspending members for antisemitic behaviour, including a local councillor for a Nazi salute in October.\n\n\n\nIn his youth, Strache was detained at a torch-lit protest organised by a group imitating the Hitler Youth, which he now dismisses as “stupid”, but not everyone is convinced by the turnaround.\n\nIn September a group remembering Nazi camp victims published a list of what it said were at least 60 antisemitic and racist incidents involving FPO figures since 2013. “If they really changed their ideology, it is a question they can only answer themselves,” said analyst Alexandra Siegl. “I would say they changed their tactics and their strategies mainly.”",

The initiative had the enthusiastic backing of Barack Obama, and was embraced by Guterres as one of his major challenges for 2018.\n\nThe aim is to publish a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration next year in time for adoption by the UN general assembly in September.\n\nLouise Arbour, appointed as the UN’s special representative to oversee the process, regards the global compact as a chance to shift world opinion on the need to address future migration, in the same way that the UN had managed to persuade the world it needed to address climate change. There are currently 60 million people who have been displaced worldwide.\n\nThe US decision to withdraw will delight Trump’s “America first” political base, but will do little to improve his standing in developing countries.\n\nThe US mission to the UN said in a statement on Saturday that the declaration “contains numerous provisions that are inconsistent with US immigration and refugee policies and the Trump administration’s immigration principles”.\n\nThe UN had always insisted that the compact was never intended to be legally binding on any country, but instead was an attempt to create a shared understanding that migration flows are likely to increase, and need to be regularised by recognising the reality of state interdependence, as much as national sovereignty.\n\nRisk of war with North Korea grows each day, says Trump's security adviser Read more\n\nIn a statement issued on Saturday, Haley said: “America is proud of our immigrant heritage and our longstanding moral leadership in providing support to migrant and refugee populations across the globe … But our decisions on immigration policies must always be made by Americans and Americans alone.”\n\nShe said: “We will decide how best to control our borders and who will be allowed to enter our country. The global approach in the New York declaration is simply not compatible with US sovereignty.”\n\nThe move, which is likely to put US-UN relations back in the deep freeze, came following pressure largely from the White House, as opposed to Haley herself.\n\nThe US has already pulled out of the UN climate change treaty and Unesco, the cultural heritage body, accusing the latter’s leadership of an anti-Israeli bias.\n\nThe impact of the migration pullout is more symbolic than practical, since the UN never had any illusion that it could control a member state’s policies.",

        "text": "Austria is a small country of only 8.4 million people in the heart of Europe. Post offices tend to confuse it with Australia, prompting Australia to once issue a special rubber stamp requesting that letters be “redirected to Austria in Europe”. Almost 22 years ago Austria, joined the EU alongside Sweden and Finland, with 67% of the Austrian population voting in favour of membership in a national referendum in June 1994 – the accession treaty was signed later that month.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Austrian economy has profited significantly from its involvement in the growing European single market. Some 70% of Austria’s foreign trade is with EU member states. When 10 more states, most from eastern Europe, joined the EU in 2004 – adding 74 million people to the union – Austria and Germany insisted on a transition period of up to seven years in which they could exercise control over their labour markets. Eastern European states had less competitive economies, a lower gross domestic product per capita and significantly lower wages. The considerable difference in income between “old” and “new” EU member states caused great public concern at the time.\n\nThis fear of foreign competition in the labour market is one of the reasons why more than 40% of Austrians now regret joining the EU.\n\nFor years Austria saw itself as an isle of the blessed, a small, peaceful country that had full employment and next to no strikes, and whose beautiful landscape and cultural highlights attracted millions of tourists every year. Vienna has topped the Mercer Quality of Living survey as the city with the highest quality of living worldwide for the third time in a row.\n\nThe effects of the global financial crisis, however, were felt in Austria too. Unemployment began to rise and is now about 9.4%, bank troubles abounded, and those who felt their jobs were threatened began to look around for a scapegoat – and began to blame the EU for all their woes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cardinal Christoph Schönborn said that the migration crisis was Europe’s biggest humanitarian challenge in decades. Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/AP\n\nHistorically, Austria’s reputation for taking in refugees has been excellent. During the Hungarian uprising of 1956 it opened its borders to thousands of Hungarians. One has only to recall James Michener’s famous statement in his book The Bridge at Andau (1957), in which he chronicled the uprising: “If I am ever required to be a refugee, I hope to make it to Austria.” Much the same happened during the Prague spring of 1968 when Austria opened its borders to let in thousands of Czechoslovakians. And during the Balkan war of 1995 it again took in thousands of people fleeing the former Yugoslavia.\n\nReligion was never a factor. Muslims from the former Yugoslavia were made just as welcome as Catholics from Croatia or Orthodox Serbs. My parish took in 30 Muslims for several months at the time and I helped some of the children learn English. I remember how surprised I was when one of the mothers asked me if her three children could dress up as the three magi at Epiphany, when Austrian children from each parish go from house to house collecting money for the Catholic Three Wise Kings’ mission. Apparently they had always joined the Catholic children back in their homeland although they were Muslims. Our parish priest smiled and said: “The money is for a humanitarian cause and will help those in need, regardless of their religion, so of course they can.” One cannot imagine that happening today.\n\nWhile the refugees and migrants who poured over the border at the end of last August were made just as welcome, a general feeling of unease was only too apparent. The government and the thousands of voluntary helpers enthusiastically welcomed Angela Merkel’s open-door policy, and the president of the Austrian bishops’ conference, Cardinal Christoph Schönborn of Vienna, rushed to the border to personally welcome the refugees, but a general scepticism about the people entering the country soon became apparent.\n\nAs trains full of refugees crossed through Austria it was evident that the women, babies and small children shown in press photographs were only a small minority. The large majority were able-bodied young men of between 20 and 35. Many Austrians wondered how little Austria, whose migrant camps were already full to overflowing, could successfully integrate them and, above all, find work for them.\n\nAt a memorial service for the 71 migrants who suffocated in a refrigerator truck found abandoned in eastern Austria, Schönborn made it clear that Europe was facing the greatest humanitarian challenge in decades, “which will change all our lives”. He deplored the failure of EU countries to share the refugee burden equally. Many Austrians could not understand why the EU authorities in Brussels were not showing more solidarity with the people who were actually having to cope with the refugee problem.\n\nFaymann quits as Austrian chancellor following far right's election victory Read more\n\nThe big turning point came when gangs of migrants sexually abused women on New Year’s Eve in Cologne. The news increased Austrians’ fears.\n\nBut the then Austrian chancellor, Werner Faymann, and Schönborn continued to insist that the open-door policy would work and that borders must remain fully open. By the end of 2015, more than 90,000 people had applied for asylum in Austria, more per capita than Germany or Sweden (and more than the US and Canada put together). Faymann was forced to change his policy and Austria closed its borders.\n\nNow Europe and European bishops are more divided than ever on the migrant issue in which religion seems to play an ever more dominant role. EU countries in eastern Europe refuse to take in Muslim refugees. The open-door policy of pope Francis and Merkel is meeting stubborn resistance in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, while Austria has decided to erect border fences and restrict the number of asylum seekers this year to 37,500. The bishop of Burgenland, Austria’s easternmost province, recently refused to let Austrian authorities erect a border fence on church land, saying erecting borders was against the Gospel message – but only this week he warned that Europe must not be “too naive” regarding plans to Islamise Europe.\n\nVienna has long been a cultural melting pot and a centre for international cooperation and inter-religious dialogue. It’s to be hoped that in its function as a bridge between east and west it can contribute towards stabilising the truly dangerous situation the EU now finds itself in. It is crucial to stem the surging support for far-right parties, which play on fears of uncontrolled inflows of migrants – but also to bring the starry-eyed idealists, who insist on keeping the doors wide open, back down to earth.\n\n• Tell us what the EU means to you and your country",

        "text": "The above dashboard shows FGM prevalence in the 17 countries where the UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme on Female Genital Mutilation operates. It is not an exhaustive illustration of FGM prevalence globally. FGM is practiced in communities around the world, but data have not been systematically collected in many of these communities.\n\nWhat is female genital mutilation (FGM)?\n\nHow many women and girls are affected?\n\nHow does FGM affect the health of women and girls?\n\nWhat are the consequences for childbirth?\n\nIs there a link between FGM and the risk of HIV infection?\n\nWhat are the psychological effects of FGM?\n\nWhat are the different types of FGM?\n\nWhich types are most common?\n\nWhy are there different terms to describe FGM, such as female genital cutting and female circumcision?\n\nWhat terminology does UNFPA use?\n\nWhere does the practice come from?\n\nAt what age is FGM performed?\n\nWhere is FGM practiced?\n\nWho performs FGM?\n\nWhat instruments are used to perform FGM?\n\nWhy is FGM performed?\n\nIs FGM required by certain religions?\n\nSince FGM is part of a cultural tradition, can it still be condemned?\n\nDoes anyone have the right to interfere in age-old cultural traditions such as FGM?\n\nWhat is the link between FGM and ethnicity?\n\nWhat does the term “medicalization of FGM” mean?\n\nIsn’t it safer for FGM to be performed by a skilled health worker rather than by somebody without a medical background?\n\nWhat is UNFPA's approach to FGM?\n\nIn which countries is FGM banned by law?\n\nWhat does the ICPD Programme of Action say about FGM?\n\nWhich international and regional instruments can be referenced for the elimination of FGM?\n\nWhat is female genital mutilation (FGM)?\n\nFGM refers to all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for cultural or other non-medical reasons.\n\nHow many women and girls are affected?\n\nAn estimated 200 million girls and women alive today are believed to have been subjected to FGM; but rates of FGM are increasing, a reflection of global population growth. Girls and women who have undergone FGM live predominately in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab States, but FGM is also practiced in select countries in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. It is also practiced among migrant populations throughout Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. (See more.)\n\nIf FGM practices continue at recent levels, 68 million girls will be cut between 2015 and 2030 in 25 countries where FGM is routinely practiced and more recent data are available.\n\nA key challenge is not only protecting girls who are currently at risk but also ensuring that those to be born in the future will be free from the dangers of the practice. This is especially important considering that FGM-concentrated countries are generally experiencing high population growth and have large youth populations. In 2015, an estimated 3.9 million girls were cut. This number of girls cut each year is projected to rise to 4.6 million girls in the year 2030.\n\nHow does FGM affect the health of women and girls?\n\nFGM has serious implications for the sexual and reproductive health of girls and women.\n\nThe effects of FGM depend on a number of factors, including the type performed, the expertise of the practitioner, the hygiene conditions under which it is performed, the amount of resistance and the general health condition of the girl/woman undergoing the procedure. Complications may occur in all types of FGM, but are most frequent with infibulation.\n\nImmediate complications include severe pain, shock, haemorrhage, tetanus or infection, urine retention, ulceration of the genital region and injury to adjacent tissue, wound infection, urinary infection, fever, and septicemia. Haemorrhage and infection can be severe enough to cause death.\n\nLong-term consequences include complications during childbirth, anaemia, the formation of cysts and abscesses, keloid scar formation, damage to the urethra resulting in urinary incontinence, dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse), sexual dysfunction, hypersensitivity of the genital area and increased risk of HIV transmission, as well as psychological effects.\n\nInfibulation, or type III FGM, may cause complete vaginal obstruction resulting in the accumulation of menstrual flow in the vagina and uterus. Infibulation creates a physical barrier to sexual intercourse and childbirth. An infibulated woman therefore has to undergo gradual dilation of the vaginal opening before sexual intercourse can take place. Often, infibulated women are cut open on the first night of marriage (by the husband or a circumciser) to enable the husband to be intimate with his wife. At childbirth, many women also have to be cut again because the vaginal opening is too small to allow for the passage of a baby. Infibulation is also linked to menstrual and urination disorders, recurrent bladder and urinary tract infections, fistulae and infertility.\n\nWhat are the consequences for childbirth?\n\nA recent study found that, compared with women who had not been subjected to FGM, those who had undergone FGM faced a significantly greater risk of requiring a Caesarean section, an episiotomy and an extended hospital stay, and also of suffering post-partum haemorrhage.\n\nWomen who have undergone infibulation are more likely to suffer from prolonged and obstructed labour, sometimes resulting in foetal death and obstetric fistula. The infants of mothers who have undergone more extensive forms of FGM are at an increased risk of dying at birth.\n\nVery recent estimates by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, The World Bank and the United Nations Population Division reveal that most of the high-FGM-prevalence countries also have high maternal mortality ratios and high numbers of maternal death. Two high-FGM-prevalence countries are among the four countries with the highest numbers of maternal death globally. Five of the high-prevalence countries have maternal mortality ratios of 550 per 100,000 live births and above.\n\nIs there a link between FGM and the risk of HIV infection?\n\nWhen one tool is used to cut several girls, as is often the case in communities where large groups of girls are cut on the same day during a socio-cultural rite, there is a risk of HIV transmission.\n\nAdditionally, due to damage to the female sexual organs, sexual intercourse can result in the laceration of tissue, which greatly increases risk of HIV transmission. The same is true for the blood loss that accompanies childbirth.\n\nWhat are the psychological effects of FGM?\n\nFGM may have lasting effects on women and girls who undergo FGM. The psychological stress of the procedure may trigger behavioural disturbances in children, closely linked to loss of trust and confidence in caregivers. In the longer term, women may suffer feelings of anxiety and depression. Sexual dysfunction may also contribute to marital conflicts or divorce.\n\nWhat are the different types of FGM?\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has identified four types of FGM:\n\nType I, also called clitoridectomy: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce.\n\nType II, also called excision: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora. The amount of tissue that is removed varies widely from community to community.\n\nType III, also called infibulation: Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and re-positioning the labia minora and/or the labia majora. This can take place with or without removal of the clitoris.\n\nType IV: All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example: pricking, piercing, incising, scraping or cauterization.\n\nOther terms related to FGM include incision, deinfibulation and reinfibulation:\n\nIncision refers to making cuts in the clitoris or cutting free the clitoral prepuce, but it also relates to incisions made in the vaginal wall and to incision of the perineum and the symphysis.\n\nDeinfibulation refers to the practice of cutting open a woman who has been infibulated to allow intercourse or to facilitate childbirth.\n\nReinfibulation is the practice of sewing the external labia back together after deinfibulation.\n\nWhich types are most common?\n\nTypes I and II are the most common, but there is variation among countries. Type III – infibulation – is experienced by about 10 per cent of all affected women and is most likely to occur in Somalia, northern Sudan and Djibouti.\n\nWhy are there different terms to describe FGM, such as female genital cutting and female circumcision?\n\nThe terminology used for this procedure has gone through various changes.\n\nWhen the practice first came to international attention, it was generally referred to as “female circumcision.” (In Eastern and Northern Africa, this term is often used to describe FGM type I.) However, the term “female circumcision” has been criticized for drawing a parallel with male circumcision and creating confusion between the two distinct practices. Adding to the confusion is the fact that health experts in many Eastern and Southern African countries encourage male circumcision to reduce HIV transmission; FGM, on the other hand, can increase the risk of HIV transmission.\n\nIt is also sometimes argued that the term obscures the serious physical and psychological effects of genital cutting on women. UNFPA does not encourage use of the term “female circumcision” because the health implications of male and female circumcision are very different.\n\nThe term “female genital mutilation” is used by a wide range of women's health and human rights organizations. It establishes a clear distinction from male circumcision. Use of the word “mutilation” also emphasizes the gravity of the act and reinforces that the practice is a violation of women's and girls’ basic human rights. This expression gained support in the late 1970s, and since 1994, it has been used in several United Nations conference documents and has served as a policy and advocacy tool. In Resolution 65/170, Member States clearly stated that female genital mutilation should be used to refer to this harmful practice.\n\nIn the late 1990s the term “female genital cutting” was introduced, partly in response to dissatisfaction with the term “female genital mutilation.” There is concern that communities could find the term “mutilation” demeaning, or that it could imply that parents or practitioners perform this procedure maliciously. Some fear the term “female genital mutilation” could alienate practicing communities, or even cause a backlash, possibly increasing the number of girls subjected to the practice.\n\nSome organizations embrace both terms, referring to “female genital mutilation/cutting” or FGM/C.\n\nWhat terminology does UNFPA use?\n\nUNFPA embraces a human rights perspective on the issue, and the term “female genital mutilation” more accurately describes the practice from a human rights viewpoint.\n\nToday, a greater number of countries have outlawed the practice, and an increasing number of communities have committed to abandon it, indicating that the social and cultural perceptions of the practice are being challenged by communities themselves, along with national, regional and international decision-makers. Therefore, it is time to accelerate the momentum towards full abandonment of the practice by emphasizing the human-rights aspect of the issue.\n\nAdditionally, the term “female genital mutilation (FGM)” is used in a number of UN and intergovernmental documents. One recent document is the 2016 UN Secretary General's Report (A/71/209) on Intensifying global efforts for the elimination of female genital mutilations. Other documents using the term “female genital mutilation” include: Report of the Secretary-General on Ending Female Genital Mutilation, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: Towards the elimination of female genital mutilation, Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa; Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action; and Eliminating female genital mutilation: An interagency statement. And each year on 6 February, the United Nations observes the “International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation.”\n\nWhere does the practice come from?\n\nThe origins of the practice are unclear. It predates the rise of Christianity and Islam. It is said some Egyptian mummies display characteristics of FGM. Historians such as Herodotus claim that, in the fifth century BC, the Phoenicians, the Hittites and the Ethiopians practiced circumcision. It is also reported that circumcision rites were practiced in tropical zones of Africa, in the Philippines, by certain tribes in the Upper Amazon, by women of the Arunta tribe in Australia, and by certain early Romans and Arabs. As recent as the 1950s, clitoridectomy was practiced in Western Europe and the United States to treat perceived ailments including hysteria, epilepsy, mental disorders, masturbation, nymphomania and melancholia. In other words, the practice of FGM has been followed by many different peoples and societies across the ages and continents.\n\nAt what age is FGM performed?\n\nIt varies. In some areas, FGM is carried out during infancy – as early as a couple of days after birth. In others, it takes place during childhood, at the time of marriage, during a woman's first pregnancy or after the birth of her first child. Recent reports suggest that the age has been dropping in some areas, with most FGM carried out on girls between the ages of 0 and 15 years.\n\nWhere is FGM practiced?\n\nThe practice can be found in communities around the world.\n\nIn Africa, FGM is known to be practiced among certain communities in 29 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda and Zambia.\n\nCertain ethnic groups in Asian countries practice FGM, including in communities in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nIn the Middle East, the practice occurs in Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen, as well as in Iraq, Iran and the State of Palestine.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, recent info shows that certain communities are practicing FGM in Georgia and the Russian Federation.\n\nIn South America, certain communities are known to practice FGM in Columbia, Ecuador, Panama and Peru.\n\nAnd in many western countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, the United Kingdom and various European countries, FGM is practiced among diaspora populations from areas where the practice is common.\n\nWho performs FGM?\n\nFGM is usually carried out by elderly people in the community (usually, but not exclusively, women) designated to perform this task or by traditional birth attendants. Among certain populations, FGM may be carried out by traditional health practitioners, (male) barbers, members of secret societies, herbalists or sometimes a female relative.\n\nIn some cases, medical professionals perform FGM. This is referred to as the “medicalization” of FGM. According to recent UNFPA’s estimates, around one in five girls subjected to FGM were cut by a trained health-care provider. In some countries, this can reach as high as three in four girls. According to estimates from demographic and health surveys and multiple indicator cluster surveys, countries where the majority of FGM cases are performed by health workers are Egypt (38%), Sudan (67%), Kenya (15%), Nigeria (13%) and Guinea (15%).\n\nWhat instruments are used to perform FGM?\n\nFGM is carried out with special knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razor blades. Anaesthetic and antiseptics are generally not used unless the procedure is carried out by medical practitioners. In communities where infibulations is practiced, girls' legs are often bound together to immobilize them for 10-14 days, allowing the formation of scar tissue.\n\nWhy is FGM performed?\n\nIn every society in which it is practiced, female genital mutilation is a manifestation of deeply entrenched gender inequality. Where it is widely practiced, FGM is supported by both men and women, usually without question, and anyone that does not follow the norm may face condemnation, harassment and ostracism. It may be difficult for families to abandon the practice without support from the wider community. In fact, it is often practiced even when it is known to inflict harm upon girls because the perceived social benefits of the practice are deemed higher than its disadvantages.\n\nThe reasons given for practicing FGM fall generally into five categories:\n\nPsychosexual reasons: FGM is carried out as a way to control women’s sexuality, which is sometimes said to be insatiable if parts of the genitalia, especially the clitoris, are not removed. It is thought to ensure virginity before marriage and fidelity afterward, and to increase male sexual pleasure.\n\nSociological and cultural reasons: FGM is seen as part of a girl’s initiation into womanhood and as an intrinsic part of a community’s cultural heritage. Sometimes myths about female genitalia (e.g., that an uncut clitoris will grow to the size of a penis, or that FGM will enhance fertility or promote child survival) perpetuate the practice.\n\nHygiene and aesthetic reasons: In some communities, the external female genitalia are considered dirty and ugly and are removed, ostensibly to promote hygiene and aesthetic appeal.\n\nReligious reasons: Although FGM is not endorsed by either Islam or by Christianity, supposed religious doctrine is often used to justify the practice.\n\nSocio-economic factors: In many communities, FGM is a prerequisite for marriage. Where women are largely dependent on men, economic necessity can be a major driver of the procedure. FGM sometimes is a prerequisite for the right to inherit. It may also be a major income source for practitioners.\n\nIs FGM required by certain religions?\n\nNo religion promotes or condones FGM. Still, more than half of girls and women in four out of 14 countries where data is available saw FGM as a religious requirement. And although FGM is often perceived as being connected to Islam, perhaps because it is practiced among many Muslim groups, not all Islamic groups practice FGM, and many non-Islamic groups do, including some Christians, Ethiopian Jews, and followers of certain traditional African religions.\n\nFGM is thus a cultural rather than a religious practice. In fact, many religious leaders have denounced it.\n\nSince FGM is part of a cultural tradition, can it still be condemned?\n\nYes. Culture and tradition provide a framework for human well-being, and cultural arguments cannot be used to condone violence against people, male or female. Moreover, culture is not static, but constantly changing and adapting. Nevertheless, activities for the elimination of FGM should be developed and implemented in a way that is sensitive to the cultural and social background of the communities that practice it. Behaviour can change when people understand the hazards of certain practices and when they realize that it is possible to give up harmful practices without giving up meaningful aspects of their culture.\n\nDoes anyone have the right to interfere in age-old cultural traditions such as FGM?\n\nEvery child has the right to be protected from harm, in all settings and at all times. The movement to end FGM – often local in origin – is intended to protect girls from profound, permanent and completely unnecessary harm. The evidence shows that most people in affected countries want to stop cutting girls, and that overall support for FGM is declining even in countries where the practice is almost universal (such as Egypt and Sudan). Ending FGM will take intensive and sustained collaboration from all parts of society, including families and communities, religious and other leaders, the media, governments and the international community.\n\nWhat is the link between FGM and ethnicity?\n\nEthnicity is the most significant factor in FGM prevalence, cutting across socio-economic class and level of education. Members of certain ethnic groups often adhere to the same social norms, including whether or not to practice FGM, regardless of where they live. The FGM prevalence among ethnic Somalis living in Kenya, for example, at 94 per cent, is similar to the prevalence in Somalia, and far higher than the Kenyan national average of 21 per cent, according to the most recent information available.\n\nBut there are exceptions. In Senegal, for example, there are major variations in FGM prevalence among Mandingue women, depending on where they live – 55 per cent in urban areas versus 84 per cent in rural areas. Similarly, FGM prevalence among the Poular ranges from 41 per cent in urban areas to 56 per cent in rural areas.\n\nWhat do women and girls who have experienced FGM say about it themselves?\n\nWomen around the world are speaking out about their experiences and advocating change.\n\n“It is what my grandmother called the three feminine sorrows: the day of circumcision, the wedding night and the birth of a baby.” –From “The Three Feminine Sorrows,” a Somali poem\n\n\"My two sisters, myself and our mother went to visit our family back home. I assumed we were going for a holiday. A bit later they told us that we were going to be infibulated. The day before our operation was due to take place, another girl was infibulated and she died because of the operation. We were so scared and didn't want to suffer the same fate. But our parents told us it was an obligation, so we went. We fought back; we really thought we were going to die because of the pain. You have one woman holding your mouth so you won't scream, two holding your chest and the other two holding your legs. After we were infibulated, we had rope tied across our legs so it was like we had to learn to walk again. We had to try to go to the toilet. If you couldn't pass water in the next 10 days something was wrong. We were lucky, I suppose. We gradually recovered and didn't die like the other girl. But the memory and the pain never really go away.\" –Zainab, who was infibulated at the age of 8 (from WHO)\n\n“I will never subject my child to FGM/C if she happens to be a girl, and I will teach her the consequences of the practice early on.” –Kadiga, Ethiopia\n\n“In my village there is one girl who is younger than I am who has not been cut because I discussed the issue with her parents. I told them how much the operation had hurt me, how it had traumatized me and made me not trust my own parents. The decided they did not want this to happen to their daughter.” –Meaza, 15 years old\n\nWhat does the term “medicalization of FGM” mean?\n\nAccording to WHO, the medicalization of FGM is when FGM is performed by a health-care provider, such as a community health worker, midwife, nurse or doctor. Medicalized FGM can take place in a public or private clinic, at home or elsewhere. It also includes the procedure of reinfibulation at any point in time in a woman’s life. In 2010, a joint interagency Global Strategy to Stop Health-Care Providers from Performing FGM was released. In 2016, WHO also released guidelines on the management of health complications from FGM. This strategy reflects consensus between international experts, United Nations entities and the Member States they represent. In addition, the global commitment to eliminate all forms of FGM by 2030 is clearly stated in target 5.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).\n\nIsn’t it safer for FGM to be performed by a skilled health worker rather than by somebody without a medical background?\n\nFGM can never be “safe”. Even when the procedure is performed in a sterile environment and by a health-care professional, there can be serious health consequences immediately and later in life. Medicalized FGM gives a false sense of security. There are serious risks associated with all forms of FGM, including medicalized FGM.\n\nIn addition, there is no medical justification for FGM. Advocating any form of cutting or harm to the genitals of girls and women, and suggesting that medical personnel should perform it is unacceptable from a public health and human rights perspective. Trained health professionals who perform female genital mutilation are violating girls’ and women’s rights to life, physical integrity and health. They are also violating the fundamental medical ethic to “do no harm.”\n\nFurthermore, the belief that a “minor” genital cut will help avoid more severe forms of FGM is unproven. Several studies have shown that girls can be subjected to FGM repeatedly when members of their family or community are dissatisfied with the results of earlier procedures. There is also evidence that FGM procedures described as “just a nick” are often actually more severe forms of FGM. One study from Sudan found that, among the women who claimed to have undergone a type of FGM considered “just a prick,” about one third had actually been subjected to infibulation, and all had experienced the removal of their clitoris and labia minora.\n\nWhen medical personnel perform FGM, they wrongly legitimize the practice as medically sound or beneficial for girls and women’s health. And because medical personnel often hold power, authority and respect in society, it can also further institutionalize the procedure.\n\nWhat is UNFPA's approach to FGM?\n\nUNFPA and UNICEF jointly lead the largest global programme to accelerate the elimination of FGM and provide care for its consequences. This programme works with governments, civil society organizations, networks of religious leaders, parliamentarians, youth and human rights activists, and academia to:\n\nSupport the development of policies and legislation, and ensure adequate resources, to end FGM;\n\nAmplify interventions that expand collective knowledge about the harms of FGM and empower champions for its elimination;\n\nSupport gender equality and girls’ and women’s rights;\n\nEmpower young people to end FGM in their communities;\n\nAddress the trend of medicalization by galvanizing health professionals to view FGM as a human rights violation;\n\nIntegrate FGM responses into sexual and reproductive health, maternal and child health, and child protection services – areas that offer entry points for identifying and supporting girls and women who are at risk or have been subjected to FGM.\n\nMainstream FGM into health training programmes, mobilize doctors, nurses and midwives in support of FGM prevention and care, and empower health providers to serve as role models, counsellors and advocates in the effort to end FGM; and\n\nEstablish a global knowledge hub for the measurement and dissemination of social norms and good practices captured by the Joint Programme for policy-making and improved programming.\n\nThe Joint Programme recognizes that eliminating FGM requires communities to make a collective and coordinated choice so that no single girl or family is disadvantaged by the decision.\n\nThis approach has seen progress. Civil society organizations are implementing community-led education and dialogue sessions on human rights and health. These networks are helping a growing number of communities declare their abandonment of FGM. A shift has occurred among religious leaders, many of whom have gone from endorsing the practice to actively condemning it. There has been a growing number of public declarations de-linking FGM from religion and supporting of abandonment of the practice.\n\nWith UNFPA technical guidance and support, there has been a surge in activities to strengthen the role of public health services in preventing FGM and, wherever possible, in treating its victims and mitigating its negative effects on women’s health. Health workers have been trained to treat complications caused by FGM, including the integration of FGM care into medical education curriculum. Referral systems that build coordination between health providers and community actors and organizations have also been strengthened.\n\nSeveral countries have passed new national legislation banning FGM and developed national policies with concrete steps to achieve the abandonment of FGM. Radio networks have aired call-in shows about the harm caused by FGM. The use of media to galvanize public opinion against the practice has helped change perceptions and transformed public perceptions of girls who remain uncut.\n\nIn which countries is FGM banned by law?\n\nAfrica: Benin (2003); Burkina Faso (1996); Central African Republic (1996, 2006); Chad (2003); Cote d'Ivoire (1998); Djibouti (1994, 2009); Egypt (2008); Eritrea (2007); Ethiopia (2004); The Gambia (2015); Ghana (1994, 2007); Guinea (1965, 2000); Guinea Bissau (2011); Liberia (2018, by one-year executive order); Kenya (2001, 2011); Mauritania (2005); Niger (2003); Nigeria (2015); Senegal (1999); South Africa (2000); Sudan (state of South Kordofan 2008, state of Gedaref 2009); Tanzania (1998); Togo (1998); Uganda (2010); Zambia (2005, 2011)\n\nOthers: Australia (6 out of 8 states between 1994-2006); Austria (2002); Belgium (2000); Canada (1997); Colombia (Resolution No. 001 of 2009 by indigenous authorities); Cyprus (2003); Denmark (2003); France (Penal Code, 1979); Italy (2005); Ireland (2012); Luxembourg (on mutilations only, not specifically on 'genital' mutilation, 2008); New Zealand (1995); Norway (1995); Portugal (2007); Spain (2003); Sweden (1982, 1998); Switzerland (2005, new stricter penal norm in 2012); United Kingdom (1985); United States (1996)\n\nPenalties range from a minimum of six months to a maximum of life in prison. Several countries also include monetary fines in the penalty.\n\nWhat does the ICPD Programme of Action say about FGM?\n\nThe Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development recognizes that violence against women is a widespread phenomenon. It states, \"In a number of countries, harmful practices meant to control women's sexuality have led to great suffering. Among them is the practice of female genital cutting, which is a violation of basic rights and a major lifelong risk to women's health” (para 7.35).\n\nThe Programme of Action calls for \"Governments and communities [to] urgently take steps to stop the practice of female genital cutting and protect women and girls from all such similar unnecessary and dangerous practices. Steps to eliminate the practice should include strong community outreach programmes involving village and religious leaders, education and counselling about its impact on girls' and women's health, and appropriate treatment and rehabilitation for girls and women who have suffered cutting. Services should include counselling for women and men to discourage the practice.\" (para 7.40)\n\nChapter 4, para 4.4 states, \"Countries should act to empower women and should take steps to eliminate inequalities between men and women as soon as possible by… eliminating all practices that discriminate against women; assisting women to establish and realize their rights, including those that relate to reproductive and sexual health.” Para 4.9, states, \"Countries should take full measure to eliminate all forms of exploitation, abuse, harassment and violence against women, adolescents and children.\"\n\nWhich international and regional instruments can be referenced for the elimination of FGM?\n\nMost governments in countries where FGM is practiced have ratified international conventions and declarations that make provisions for the promotion and protection of the health of women and girls. For example:\n\n1948\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims the right of all human beings to live in conditions that enable them to enjoy good health and health care (art. 25). Adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has five articles which together form a basis to condemn FGM: article 2 on discrimination, article 3 concerning the right to security of person, article 5 on cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, article 12 on privacy, and article 25 on the right to a minimum standard of living (including adequate health care) and protection of motherhood.\n\n1951\n\nThe Convention relating to the Status of Refugees defines who is a refugee, what their rights are, and explains the legal obligations of states. Those fleeing the threat of FGM qualify for refugee status.\n\n1966\n\nThe International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights condemn discrimination on the grounds of sex and recognize the universal right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health (art. 12).\n\n1979\n\nThe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women requires State Parties to: \"take all appropriate measure to modify or abolish customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women\" (art. 2f) and \"modify social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes\" (art 5a).\n\nGeneral recommendation 24 (1999) of the Convention emphasizes that certain cultural or traditional practices, such as FGM, carry a high risk of death and disability and recommends that State parties should ensure laws that prohibit FGM.\n\nGeneral recommendation 14 (1990) recommends State parties take appropriate and effective measures to eradicate FGM; to collect and disseminate basic data on traditional practices; to support women's organizations that work for the elimination of harmful practices; to encourage politicians, professionals, religious and community leaders to co-operate in influencing attitudes; to introduce appropriate educational and training programmes; to include appropriate strategies aimed at ending FGM into national health policies; to invite assistance, information and advice from the appropriate organization of the United Nations system; and to include in their reports to the Committee, under articles 10 and 12 of the Convention, information about measures taken to eliminate FGM.\n\n1984\n\nThe Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment was adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by General Assembly resolution 39/46 (entered into force in 1990). The Committee against Torture clearly states in General Comment No. 2 that FGM falls within its mandate. The UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women and the UN Special Rapporteur on torture have both recognized that FGM can amount to torture under this Convention.\n\n1989\n\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child protects against all forms of mental and physical violence and maltreatment (art 19.1); calls for freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment (art 37a); and requires States to take all effective and appropriate measures to abolish traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children (art 24.3).\n\n1993\n\nThe Vienna Declaration and the Programme of Action of the World Conference on Human Rights expanded the international human rights agenda to include gender-based violence, including FGM.\n\n1994\n\nThe International Conference on Population and Development Programme of Action calls for governments to “urgently take steps to stop the practice of female genital cutting and protect women and girls from all such similar unnecessary and dangerous practices.”\n\n1995\n\nThe Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women urges governments, international organizations and non-governmental groups to develop policies and programmes to eliminate all forms of discrimination against girls, including female genital cutting.\n\n1997\n\nThe African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights highlights human rights. Article 4 focuses on integrity of the person, article 5 on human dignity and protection against degradation, article 16 on the right to health, and article 18 (3) on the protection of the rights of women and children.\n\n1998\n\nThe Addis Ababa Declaration on Violence against Women serves as an important step towards the formulation of an African charter on violence against women, providing the framework for national laws against FGM. It was adopted at the Council of Ministers during its sixty-eighth Session in July 1998 by the Organization of African Unity (OAU). The Declaration was later endorsed by the Assembly of Heads of State and Governments.\n\nThe Banjul Declaration condemns FGM and demands its elimination.\n\n1999\n\nThe United Nations Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee approved a resolution that calls upon States to implement national legislation and policies that prohibit traditional or customary practices that damage the health of women and girls, including FGM.\n\nThe Ouagadougou Declaration of the Regional Workshop on the Fight against Female Genital Mutilation calls for networks and mechanisms to combat FGM.\n\nKey Actions for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development calls for governments to promote the human rights of women and girls and ensure their freedom from coercion, discrimination and violence, including harmful practices. It also calls for governments to ensure health providers are knowledgeable and trained to serve clients who have been subjected to harmful practices.\n\n2000\n\nFurther Actions and Initiatives to Implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action recognizes the progress made in national efforts to ban FGM, and points out that discriminatory attitudes and norms continue to make girls and women vulnerable to gender-based violence, including FGM. It calls for governments to combat and eliminate violence against women.\n\n2001\n\nThe European Parliament adopted a resolution on female genital mutilation calling for measures to protect survivors of the practice and urging member states to recognize the right to asylum for women and girls at risk of being subject to FGM.\n\n2003\n\nThe Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ rights, on the rights of women in Africa, also known as the Maputo Protocol calls for the “elimination of harmful practices.”\n\n2007\n\nCommission on the Status of Women passed a resolution on ending FGM.\n\n2010\n\nCommission of the Status of Women passed Resolution 54/7 on ending FGM .\n\n2011\n\nAfrican Union Assembly/AU/Dec. 383(XVII) produced a decision stating that “female genital mutilation (FGM) is a gross violation of the fundamental human rights of women and girls, with serious repercussions on the lives of millions of people worldwide, especially women and girls in Africa.”\n\nThe Fifty-sixth session of the Commission on the Status of Women approved a draft decision, “Ending female genital mutilation.” (E/CN.6/2012/L.1) The Secretary-General released a report, “Ending Female Genital Mutilation” summarizing progress made on the implementation of 2010 CSW resolution 54/7.\n\nThe World Health Assembly passed (resolution WHA61.16) and Progress Report 2011 (A64/26), both referring to FGM.\n\n2012\n\nEuropean Parliament Resolution of 14 June 2012 focused on ending female genital mutilation.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly passed The Girl Child Resolution (62/140), stating it was “deeply concerned… that female genital mutilation is an irreparable, irreversible harmful practice.” The Secretary-General’s Report on the Girl Child also included a special emphasis on FGM (A/64/315, 2009 and A/66/257, 2012).\n\nUnited Nations General Assembly also passed Resolution 67/146 on intensifying global efforts to eliminate FGM, reaffirmed by Resolution 69/150 in 2014 and 71/168 in 2016.\n\n2014\n\nThe Human Rights Council produced a resolution calling for “Intensifying global efforts and sharing good practices to effectively eliminate female genital mutilation.”\n\n2015\n\nFGM is included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under Target 5.3, “Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation.”\n\n2016\n\nUnited Nations General Assembly adopted The Girl Child Resolution (A/RES/70/138) recognizes FGM as a form of \"discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child.\"\n\nSources\n\nFemale Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A Statistical Overview and Exploration of the Dynamics of Change.

        "text": "Hawa Aden Mohamed is Executive Director of The Galkayo Center , the Puntland-based partner of international women's group Donor Direct Action . The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n\n(CNN) One of the few positives for U.S. women and girls in recent years has been the increased awareness of female genital mutilation (FGM) as an urgent issue which affects over half a million people on American soil. The first ever U.S. trial is about to take place too and the government is finally taking action to end it.\n\nOver 200 million of us around the world and where I live in rural Somalia almost every single woman and girl has undergone FGM. 98% of Somali women and girls have been affected - the highest prevalence rate of anywhere in the world.\n\nAlmost two thirds of us undergo infibulation - the most extreme form, which leaves girls with their labia stitched together following excision of the clitoris.\n\nThis makes urinating and menstruating almost impossible as a girl is forced to do so through a hole the size of a matchstick. That's not to say that any form of FGM is acceptable and it is always a human rights violation.\n\nLast year, I met 15 year-old Istar, who had been married off to a 70 year-old man in Eastern Somalia. He paid 10 camels and a gun for her. Istar had been subjected to infibulation.\n\nAs happens with many girls who have undergone this type of FGM, her new husband was unable to penetrate her during sex. He used a traditional dagger to cut her open. But he did it with so much force that the dagger went deep, affecting the vagina walls and cutting into her cervix.\n\nIstar started bleeding profusely, forcing her family to seek medical help and counseling. Although she is now out of immediate danger, Istar is deeply traumatised and, unsurprisingly, she does not want to go back to her husband.\n\nAlthough it is sometimes used as an excuse, there is no religious obligation at all for girls to undergo FGM. Nor does it happen in a vacuum. FGM is directly related to other forms of violence against women and girls.\n\nDomestic violence is also highly prevalent here - and over three quarters of married women aged 15-49 think that a beating can be justified in certain circumstances. So-called \"child marriage\" is highly prevalent too and is often seen as a driver for FGM occurring in the first place.\n\nAfter several months of extreme drought, it has finally rained in Somalia. This is a huge relief to many, but it also means that girls are now at enormous risk. Schools are closed for the Summer and many town dwellers have moved back to rural areas. Families think it's the \"right time\" for them to hold FGM ceremonies. This is the time of the year when girls are at extreme risk.\n\nAs a survivor myself, I know its effects first hand and wanted to do something to help end it. I set up a center in the late 1990s to end FGM and other forms of violence against girls by working at various levels, but with a big focus on education.\n\nWe provide free schooling to more than 800 poor, orphaned and displaced girls in primary school and to 1,600 girls over age 13 in \"non-formal\" education. Nationally, only 24.6% of girls attend school, but as a result of our work, girls' enrollment in northeast Somalia has increased to 40%, the highest rate in the country.\n\nWe teach each of these girls about the harms of FGM and how it can be ended. We try to persuade these girls that their destinies are their own to make.\n\nPhotos: Turning the tide on female genital mutilation Photos: Turning the tide on female genital mutilation More women have undergone FGM in Egypt than any other country. Here, women wait to tell their stories about living with FGM at the Society of Islamic Center near Sohag in January 2015. Hide Caption 1 of 4 Photos: Turning the tide on female genital mutilation Most Egyptian girls are \"cut,\" as it is often called, between the ages of nine and 12. Here, in a photo provided to CNN by the UNFPA, children of a similar age attend class at a school in Assiut on February 1. Hide Caption 2 of 4 Photos: Turning the tide on female genital mutilation The practice was banned in 2008, but Egypt predicts that more than half of girls in the future will be submitted to FGM. Here, in a photo provided to CNN by the UNFPA, children attend school in Assiut on February 1st, 2015. Hide Caption 3 of 4 Photos: Turning the tide on female genital mutilation U.N. agencies have adopted a school-based model to try to educate girls about the procedure. Here, in a photo provided to CNN by the UNFPA, a group of girls stand outside the Society of Islamic Center near Sohag on January 31. Hide Caption 4 of 4\n\nThey can break the cycle of abuse in their own lives and in their families. Somalia has promised to ban FGM for several years, but has yet to follow through on doing so. Since 2014 though,the most severe form of infibulation has been illegal in the Puntland region - thanks to a Presidential decree.\n\nMali, This is part of a recent wave of bans across the African continent. Nigeria and The Gambia both made it illegal to perform FGM in 2015. This leaves Somalia in a small group of countries including Liberia Sudan and Sierra Leone , which have yet to enact laws against it.\n\nUnfortunately, only 33% of Somali women and girls think FGM should end, although this number is somewhat higher for wealthier and more educated categories. There is no discernible reduction in prevalence either between middle-aged women and adolescent girls.\n\nI know that we must still climb a huge mountain if this abuse is to be eliminated within our lifetime.\n\nThat said, my eyes are firmly on the goal.\n\nWe can speed things up, but we need to get money to the front-lines, where it can be used most effectively. There are so few of us working on this and we cannot always reach everyone with such limited resources.\n\nTo date, we have seen much increased awareness of the issue in the U.S. and discussion at international level, but those of us working at local level have not been able to access enough funds to carry out our urgent work.\n\nChanging the futures of girls in this region is my life's mission and I won't stop until I have done my part to protect every single girl at risk. Hearing the experiences of girls like Istar - as I do almost every day - terrifies me, but it also drives me to keep going. I have no other option.\n\nThe lives of Somali girls and women depend on it.",

        "text": "Activists have welcomed a ban on female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) in the new constitution of Somalia – where 96% of women undergo one of the more extreme forms of the practice – but warn that translating the law into action will require more than just a legal declaration.\n\n\"The fact that the new provisional constitution outlaws the circumcision of girls is a welcome development, but this will require education, awareness-raising and strong legal provisions. Without this, the provision will be little more than ink on a piece of paper,\" Fatima Jibrell, a women's advocate, told IRIN.\n\nThe provisional constitution states: \"Circumcision of girls is a cruel and degrading customary practice, and is tantamount to torture. The circumcision of girls is prohibited.\"\n\nIn Somalia, the most common form of FGM/C is type III, known as infibulation, which, according to the World Health Organisation, involves the \"removal of part or all of the external genitalia (clitoris, labia minora, and labia majora) and stitching and/or narrowing of the vaginal opening\". Globally, an estimated 100-140 million girls (92 million in Africa) live with FGM/C. Another 3 million are at risk of undergoing the procedure annually.\n\nHawa Abdi, a 23-year-old mother of two, was circumcised when she was 10. Today, she lives in neighbouring Kenya, having fled two years ago to escape the violence in Somalia. Recalling the pain she went through during the procedure, Hawa says the ban, if implemented, offers hope for future generations of girls and women.\n\n\"[Female] circumcision is painful and the problems it creates for you are there until you die. You are robbed of your womanhood … Now parents who do not want their daughters circumcised can say the law does not allow it,\" she said.\n\nOpposing the ban\n\nSome, however, have issues with the new law. Women in Somalia often cannot get married without undergoing the practice, and the beliefs that FGM/C is a religious requirement, makes women pure, and reduces sexual libido remain widespread.\n\n\"Many men and some women will oppose it on the ground of culture, Islam or issues of chastity,\" Jibrell said.\n\n\"We have had it [FGM/C] in our culture. The writers of the constitution know it, and they are pretending to hate it. We can't abandon something that has helped our girls to stay pure,\" Jirde, a Somali elder, told IRIN in the Kenyan capital Nairobi.\n\n\"Our men will not have girls to marry because you can't marry [an] uncircumcised [woman] if you are a true Somali man. It is these people who give us money who say you must ban circumcision and then we give money,\" Jirde added.\n\nCarrying out community empowerment programmes, raising awareness of the health effects of the practice and delinking it from Islam, experts said, must complement the law, helping it avoid possible collision with deeply rooted cultural beliefs.\n\n\"A lot is required … [to] work with the religious leaders … [for] a consensus on the abandonment of all forms of FGM/C … empowerment programmes for the girls to be able 'speak out' of their circumcision status and to be happy of their status will be crucial since currently no woman or girl would want to be known as not circumcised since it's unheard of,\" Sheema Sen Gupta, a senior child protection officer with UN children's fund Unicef, said.\n\nSheema said that without adequate community involvement, the new law risks driving the practice underground rather than eradicating it: \"As we have learned from several other countries, community empowerment is very crucial to avoid the practice from going underground.\"\n\nRisk of severe bleeding, infection and infertility are some of the side-effects of the procedure, as are obstetric complications including postpartum haemorrhage and infant mortality. Research suggests that girls who have undergone FGM/C are more prone to mental disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.",

        "text": "Egyptian Doctor Found Guilty Of Female Genital Mutilation Isn't In Jail\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Equality Now Courtesy of Equality Now\n\nIn January, Dr. Raslan Fadl was convicted after one of his patients, a young girl called Soheir al Batea, died under his care.\n\nBut Fadl hasn't served a day behind bars.\n\nSoheir was 13 years old when her parents took her to Fadl to undergo a procedure that's a rite of passage for most girls here in the Nile Delta — genital cutting.\n\nIt's known around here as \"cleansing,\" but most people call it female genital mutilation or female circumcision — a procedure that has been illegal in Egypt since 2008.\n\nThe practice is especially common in the more rural areas of Egypt. The country's health ministry estimates that 87 percent of all Egyptian women between the ages of 15 and 49 have been circumcised. For Soheir, the girl with big brown eyes, the age-old custom killed her.\n\nAnd Fadl is the first doctor to be handed a prison sentence in connection to the practice. He was ordered to serve two years and three months, the minimum he could get, but women's rights groups — which have been fighting against the often-dangerous practice — hailed the conviction as a victory.\n\nSo why isn't Fadl in jail?\n\nPolice say they're searching for him day and night, that he's a fugitive. But when I went to his village, it wasn't that difficult to track him down.\n\nI went to his neighborhood and found a new sign hanging above his clinic; the clinic was closed. Neighbors said he's operating out of the second floor of his home, just around the corner.\n\nWhen I tried visiting his home, a woman opened the door and claimed he was traveling. \"Only God knows when he'll be back,\" she said.\n\nSo I went to the government hospital in a nearby town, where I was told he worked at least once a week.\n\nRealizing I — as a foreigner — might draw attention, I asked an Egyptian friend accompanying me to go inside and ask for the doctor. (I'm not using my friend's name to keep him out of trouble.)\n\n\"I asked about him,\" my friend said, when he came back out. \"He checked me up. And I got his phone and everything. He's working.\"\n\nSo the doctor who supposedly is on the run is working in a government hospital. This is a hospital that has police stationed inside it routinely, including when I was there. He gave my friend a full checkup and offered to perform surgery at his clinic at home or at the hospital.\n\nLater, with the help of a translator, I called Dr. Fadl and asked him why he's not in jail. He said he is on the run from security and his case was unjust. He denies performing a circumcision on Soheir. When we tell him he was spotted at the hospital, he acknowledges he still works there.\n\nThen we call a local police official and ask if efforts are being made to locate Fadl. The official describes a day and night search for Fadl. When we ask, how then is this man working at a government hospital, the line goes dead and repeated callbacks go unanswered.\n\n\"They feel he didn't really commit a crime and they don't really have to go and arrest him. He should have been in prison for quite some time by now,\" says Suad Abu Dayyeh of Equality Now, the international organization that took up Soheir's case and pushed for the conviction.\n\n\"Although we were delighted about the conviction,\" she says, \"the implementation of the conviction is very important.\"\n\nShe says that allowing Fadl to walk free sends the message that FGM is OK. Even though the practice was outlawed in 2008, it remains widespread.\n\nMany Egyptian parents who cling to the tradition believe it benefits their child. It's believed that circumcision quells women's sexual desires, makes them pure and more attractive for marriage. Activists say parents believe they are protecting their daughters.\n\nThat's certainly the case for Soheir al Batea's parents and family.\n\nThey live in a rundown home on a sewage-filled, unpaved street. Soheir's grandmother has the same name as her late granddaughter. She blames the doctor for her granddaughter's death, but she says she still believes the procedure is good for women, that it makes them clean.\n\nShe had it done and so have all the women in her family. She indicates that Soheir el Batea's younger sister will likely get it done, too, when she's older. But then she quickly changes her tune and says, \"It's not done anymore.\"\n\nA few miles away Soheir is entombed in an above-ground grave with a little green door.\n\nI visited it along with Reda al-Danbouki, the women's rights lawyer who led the case against Dr. Fadl.\n\n\"She was supposed to wear a white dress at her wedding someday,\" Danbouki says. \"Instead, the white dress she wears is the one put on her body when she was laid to rest. She did not get justice. She does not rest in peace.\"",

But prosecutors appealed against the verdict and on Monday it was overturned.\n\nImage copyright AP Image caption Suhair al-Bataa was operated on at a clinic in Aga, north-east of the capital, Cairo\n\nFadl was sentenced to two years in prison for manslaughter and three months for performing the FGM procedure, according to Equality Now. His clinic was also ordered to close for a year.\n\nSuhair's father was meanwhile given a three-month suspended sentence.\n\nThe practice of FGM was banned in Egypt in 2008 but the country still has one of the highest rates of prevalence in the world.\n\nAnalysis: Orla Guerin, BBC News, Cairo\n\nActivists say justice has finally been done for Suhair al-Bataa and a precedent has been set. \"The new sentence will deter doctors from performing this dangerous practice,\" said Manal Fawzi, who campaigns against FGM in southern Egypt.\n\nMaybe so, but it took a dogged campaign by local and international groups to ensure a prosecution was brought. The sentence was broadly welcomed but media interest has waned in the wait for the initial verdict, and the appeal result is not expected to garner too much attention.\n\nSo far, it has been reported on the websites of the main newspapers but the stories are brief. There has been no coverage so far by the state agency.\n\nIn many areas, doctors and untrained backstreet practitioners continue to flout the law banning FGM, though many tend to keep a low profile. Last year one told us she was carrying out three procedures a week and had a waiting list. She admitted that four people had to restrain each girl, who screamed throughout.\n\nCampaigners say that ending the mutilation of young girls is also dependent on persuading families to abandon a long-held tradition, which many believe - wrongly - is a religious duty.\n\nMore than 90% of girls and women aged between 15 and 59 in the country have undergone the procedure, according to UN estimates.\n\nTypically it is carried out on girls aged between nine and 13 but there are victims as young as six, anti-FGM campaigners say.\n\nThe case against Fadl was the first time a prosecution relating to FGM had been brought to trial.\n\nSuad Abu-Dayyeh, a spokeswoman for Equality Now, called Monday's sentencing \"a monumental victory for women and girls in Egypt\".\n\n\"The country has shown that it will implement its laws and we hope that this is the first step towards ending this extreme form of violence against women once and for all,\" she said.\n\nThe number of girls who have died following FGM is unclear, as deaths are commonly recorded as haemorrhages or allergic reactions to antibiotics.",

        "text": "NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A 10-year-old girl in central Somalia has died after undergoing female genital mutilation (FGM), prompting calls from campaigners to criminalize the internationally condemned practice in a country with the world’s highest rates.\n\nThe girl was taken by her mother to a traditional circumciser on July 14. The procedure left her bleeding and she died in hospital due to a hemorrhage two days later.\n\n“The circumciser is suspected to have cut an important vein in the course of the operation,” said Hawa Aden Mohamed, director of the Galkayo Education Center for Peace and Development (GECPD), a local women’s rights group.\n\n“The woman who performed the operation has not been arrested but even if she was, there is no law that would ensure she is punished for the act. This is just one among many cases happening on a daily basis across Somalia.”\n\nAn estimated 200 million girls and women worldwide have undergone FGM, which usually involves the partial or total removal of the female genitalia and can cause a host of serious health problems, says the United Nations.\n\nThe ancient ritual - practiced in at least 27 African countries and parts of Asia and the Middle East - is usually carried out by traditional cutters, often using unsterilized blades or knives.\n\nHealth experts say FGM can cause fatal childbirth complications later in life. In some cases, girls can bleed to death or die from infections following the procedure, although it is hidden within communities and rarely reported.\n\nLocated in eastern Africa and troubled by decades of civil war, Somalia has the world’s highest rates of FGM. According to the UN, 98 percent of women between 15 and 49 have been subjected to the ritual.\n\nSomalia’s constitution prohibits FGM, but efforts to pass legislation to punish offenders have been stalled by parliamentarians afraid of losing powerful Muslim vote banks who support FGM and view it as a part of their tradition.\n\nCampaigners say a lot of work needs to be done to help people understand the harmful effects of FGM, and criminalizing the practice could act as a strong deterrent.\n\n“Pro-FGM lobbyists sometimes put forward the nonsensical view that it is not harmful, which is completely untrue,” said Brendan Wynne at Donor Direct Action, an international women’s groups which helps fund grassroots charities.\n\n“We have no more time for any debate on the harms of FGM and this case, like many others, proves that. FGM will only end when governments take a hard line and protect girls at risk.”",

The ritual cutting away of part or all of the external female genitalia continues in force around the world. A new UNICEF report estimates that at least 200 million women alive today have undergone what's known as female genital mutilation (FGM).\n\nRelated NPR Stories UNICEF Estimate Of Female Genital Mutilation Up By 70 Million\n\nBut now there's a concerted effort to convince communities that Nice Nailantei Leng'ete was right — and that there's a way to mark a girl's maturity without cutting. On Feb. 7, International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, Ban Ki­-moon, chief of the United Nations, called for \"a better way\" than the ritual cutting away of part or all of the external female genitalia. The U.N. has described the practice as \"violent\" and a violation of the rights of girls and women.\n\nStill, resistance remains in some cultures and communities. This week, two American gynecologists published an article in the British Journal of Medical Ethics, proposing a \"compromise solution\" that would permit minimal female genital \"nicks\" that would \"accommodate cultural beliefs while protecting the physical health of girls, but would proscribe those forms of FGA that are dangerous or that produce significant sexual or reproductive dysfunction.\"\n\nAre such nicks \"a better way\"?\n\nDr. Githinji Gitahi doesn't believe so. He's a physician with a specialty in OB­-GYN and a leader in the group Amref Health Africa. \"It's important to understand that FGM has no medical benefits and as such, to advocate for any form of it is to miss the point,\" he wrote in an e­mail. \"FGM is a harmful practice which results in numerous medical complications including severe bleedings, infection, blockage of the urinary tract with renal complications and even death and later in life may result in inability to deliver normally.\"\n\nIn fact, some communities are embracing ceremonies that do away with all cutting.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rebecca Sell Rebecca Sell\n\nThe new traditions are taking hold in Maasai and Samburu communities in Kenya and Tanzania. After two or three days of preparatory sessions for the girls, the celebration culminates with communal singing and dancing and blessings by the village elders, who pour a mixture of milk and honey and water over the heads of the girls. Goats and cows are slaughtered for specially prepared stews or roasts. Traditional beer is brewed for the men to drink. The young women don multi­colored clothing and decorative beads that dangle from their heads and hang around their necks.\n\nSuch ceremonies have included from 200 to more than 1,000 girls, says, Peter N. Nguura, project manager, of Unite for Body Rights Project, AMREF Kenya Country Office, with several communities often coming together for the celebration. Usually, the elders also make a public declaration abandoning FGM, and the young men will similarly make public assurances that they will marry women who did not undergo FGM. That's important because any girl who refused to be cut was shamed and shunned, subjected to a life of isolation, without marriage or children.\n\nAnd at the center of the celebration are the girls themselves. During the two to three days preceding the celebration, participating girls in the alternative rites of passage are secluded, in a school dormitory or village hut, where they learn about womanhood: lessons which now include sex education, information about STDs and violence against women, and presentations emphasizing the importance of continuing education for girls' and women's rights. The traditional cutters who had in the past performed the cut also are usually present, discussing their role in the past — and explaining the health reasons for abandoning the practice. \"They will say, 'We did this because we believed in it, but now we want to encourage girls to go back to school,' \" says Leng'ete.\n\nWomen like Leng'ete share their own stories at these ceremonies. Now 25, she became the only girl in her village in KENYA to complete her secondary education. As project manager of AMREF's Scaling Up Alternative Rites of Passage program, she spreads the word that there are alternative rites of passage.\n\nBut for such celebrations to succeed as an ongoing alternative to cutting, the entire community must be accepting, says Jacinta Muteshi­-Strachan, project director of the FGM/C (the \"c\" is for cutting) research program for the Population Council. That means chiefs and elders, fathers and mothers, even the traditional cutters. It can take six months or more of meetings before a community agrees to abandon FGM and accept alternative rites.\n\nRebecca Sell, a freelance photojournalist and associate professor at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, was present at an alternative rites of passage celebration in August 2013. It took place in Esititeti, Kenya, located near the foot of Mt. Kilimanjaro, where the Africa Schools of Kenya was helping implement the program. At that time, only about 20 girls participated in the ceremony; now, she says, 200 to 300 girls, including those from neighboring communities, also take part. In one memorable moment, as in a graduation ceremony, the girls stood in line in their finery as their names were called out. Each received a certificate declaring they had completed the alternative rite of passage.\n\n\"From the mothers and older women I got to know, there was a lot of self-respect. They are pleased that the community is committing to [ending FGM],\" says Sell. \"They know that making the change is a big deal for them and their daughters. There is a lot of pride.\"",

These efforts have included establishing the Islamophobia Observatory, which issues an annual report on countering Islamophobia.\n\nShe also pointed out that the OIC has made efforts to engage the media, western governments, civil society and regional and international organizations such as the European Union and UNESCO in order to fight Islamophobia.\n\nAqeel explained that the OIC established a ministerial Contact Group of European Muslims in 2016 to communicate more closely and regularly with officials and communities in Europe, in addition to establishing a correspondence center to respond to the arguments and fatwas of extremist groups.\n\n“The OIC is in the process of establishing a global press award for journalists who contribute to the promotion of inter-cultural dialogue and tolerance,” she added.\n\nAqeel said that the two-day forum would explore ways to establish cooperation between media professionals from OIC member states and the European Union to help curb hate speech, stereotyping and fake news, “all of which negatively impact society and provoke intolerance.”\n\nThe forum’s sessions discussed press freedom from legal and religious perspectives, and introduced attendees to the contents of the OIC Media Strategy to Counter Islamophobia and ISESCO’s Program for Training Media Professionals on Redressing Stereotypes about Islam and Muslims.",

        "text": "The OIC Secretary General appears to be laying the diplomatic groundwork to persuade non-elected bureaucrats at EU headquarters to enact hate-speech legislation that would limit by fiat what 500-million European citizens -- including democratically elected politicians -- can and cannot say about Islam.\n\nThe Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), an influential bloc of 57 Muslim countries, has officially inaugurated a Permanent Observer Mission to the European Union (EU).\n\nThe primary objective of the OIC, headquartered in Saudi Arabia and funded by Islamic countries around the world, has long been to pressure Europe and the United States into passing laws that would ban \"negative stereotyping of Islam.\"\n\nThe establishment of a permanent OIC presence in Brussels implies that the group intends to redouble its lobbying efforts aimed at outlawing all forms of \"Islamophobia\" [a term invented by the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1990s] within the 27-member EU, where restrictions on free speech regarding Islam-related issues are already commonplace (see here, here, here and here).\n\nOIC Secretary General Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu opened the mission to the EU during a formal inauguration ceremony in Brussels on June 25; it was attended by diplomats, EU officials and dignitaries from Europe and across the Muslim world.\n\nIn his inaugural speech, Ihsanoglu declared, \"There is a growing and developing interest at the highest level in the EU to cooperate with the OIC… I think our relations with the European Union on the different agenda items that we share will benefit all of us. There is a need for cooperation between the Muslim world and Europe, and the OIC, as a collective voice of the Muslim world which stands for modernization and moderation, will be the proper institution to deal with the EU.\"\n\nIhsanoglu -- who recently said in an interview with Al Jazeera Television that his number one job is to combat the religious persecution of Muslims in the West -- added, \"We need to seriously fight against Islamophobia to further strengthen ties between the Islamic world and Europe and to eradicate the unnecessary sensitivities.\"\n\nSince the late 1990s, the OIC has been promoting the so-called Istanbul Process, an aggressive effort by Muslim countries to make it an international crime to criticize Islam. The explicit aim of the Istanbul Process is to enshrine in international law a global ban on all critical scrutiny of Islam and Islamic Sharia law.\n\nIn recent years, the OIC has been engaged in a determined diplomatic offensive to persuade Western democracies to implement United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) Resolution 16/18, which calls on all countries to combat \"intolerance, negative stereotyping and stigmatization of … religion and belief.\" (Analysis of the OIC's war on free speech can be found here and here.)\n\nResolution 16/18, which was adopted at HRC headquarters in Geneva in March 2011 (with the support of the Obama Administration) -- together with the OIC-sponsored Resolution 66/167, which was quietly approved by the 193-member UN General Assembly on December 19, 2011 -- is widely viewed as marking a significant step forward in OIC efforts to advance the international legal concept of defaming Islam.\n\nThe OIC scored a diplomatic coup when the Obama Administration agreed to host a three-day Istanbul Process conference in Washington, DC on December 12-14, 2011. By doing so, the United States gave the OIC the political legitimacy was seeking to globalize its initiative to ban criticism of Islam.\n\nRefusing to be outdone by the Americans, the EU subsequently hosted an Istanbul Process conference at Wilton Park in London on December 3-5, 2012. The aim of the event was \"to arrive at a common understanding of UN Human Rights Council Resolution 16/18 on combating religious intolerance and the difference in emphasis with regard freedom of expression.\"\n\nAccording to Ihsanoglu, the EU's offer to host the meeting, which gathered legal experts, NGOs, government representatives, academics, legislators and educators as well as OIC representatives, represented a \"qualitative shift in action against the phenomenon of Islamophobia.\"\n\nThe OIC has been especially annoyed over its inability to silence a growing number of democratically elected politicians in Europe who have voiced concerns over the refusal of Muslim immigrants to integrate into their host countries and the consequent establishment of parallel Islamic societies in many parts of Europe.\n\nAccording to Ihsanoglu, \"The phenomenon of Islamophobia is found in the West in general, but is growing in European countries in particular and in a manner different than that in the US, which had contributed to drafting Resolution 16/18. The new European position represents the beginning of the shift from their previous reserve over the years over the attempts by the OIC to counter 'defamation of religions' in the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations.\"\n\nNevertheless, the OIC has been unable to garner sufficient support for an all-encompassing global blasphemy law within the framework of the UN, and Ihsanoglu announced in October 2012 that the OIC would change its strategy by appealing to individual nation-states to enact hate-speech laws concerning Islam.\n\nThe OIC has also stepped up efforts to criminalize the criticism of Islam on the basis of Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), a multilateral treaty that forms part of the International Bill of Human Rights.\n\nAccording to the OIC, Article 20 of ICCPR states that denigration of symbols or persons sacred to any religion is a criminal offense, and Ihsanoglu says the only problem is its lack of enforcement by signatory states.\n\nOn January 7-8, 2013, the OIC held a meeting of international legal and human rights experts in Istanbul with the stated aim of examining the legal options for \"banning religious intolerance against Muslims.\"\n\nDelivering the opening remarks, Ihsanoglu said: \"This meeting of ours in Istanbul is a crucial milestone of a multifaceted, multisided, diplomatic and legal process against Islamophobia, and on the campaign initiated against Islam and its prophet.\"\n\nIhsanoglu added: \"Since the first day I assumed office, we have been able to see the adoption of resolutions defending Islam and condemning the attacks against Islam at the United Nations General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.\"\n\nIn a clear sign that the OIC has no intention of abandoning UN Resolution 16/18, Ihsanoglu said, \"The issue to be discussed today by the wise men is how '16/18' will be implemented. We will discuss the sanctions from the view of international law... what would happen when arrogant cartoons get drawn or a movie gets shot.\"\n\nOn January 22, 2013, Ihsanoglu told British government officials attending a \"High Level Meeting on Intolerance\" in London that Islamophobia is an issue of \"utmost contemporary significance\" and a matter of \"vital concern.\" He encouraged the EU to brainstorm on building common ground on combating \"intolerance and discrimination against Muslims.\"\n\nThus by establishing a permanent OIC presence in Brussels, Ihsanoglu appears to be laying the diplomatic groundwork to persuade non-elected bureaucrats at EU headquarters to enact pan-European hate speech legislation that would limit by fiat what 500 million European citizens -- including democratically elected politicians -- can and cannot say about Islam.\n\nSpeaking to Turkish media outlets on June 24 ahead of the opening ceremony in Brussels, Ihsanoglu warned the EU against allowing any speech that could be deemed hostile to Islam.\n\nFor example, Ihsanoglu urged the EU to ban the use of the term \"Islamic terrorist\" and replace it with the word \"jihadist\" instead. According to Ihsanoglu, \"jihad does not necessarily mean killing the other\" and he blamed Westerners for distorting the concept of jihad to mean \"holy war.\" He said that Muslim scholars have repeatedly affirmed that the word jihad, which is mentioned in the Koran, simply means the \"struggle\" to do good and to remove injustice, oppression and evil from society.\n\nMeanwhile, the OIC has been organizing \"anti-Islamophobia symposia\" across Europe. Entitled \"Smearing Islam and Muslims in the Media,\" the first-of-its-kind event was held in Brussels on February 15-16, 2012, and was \"aimed at establishing information mechanisms to face up to the slanderous campaigns against Islam in the media.\"\n\nAnother OIC organ called the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (IESCO) organized a seminar in Brussels on \"how to deal with stereotypical images of Islam in European television programs.\"\n\nThe seminar was designed to help European journalists \"identify characteristics of stereotypes about Islam in European television programs, highlight the dangers of defamation of religions, and clarify the distinction between freedom of expression and the right to cultural difference, the commitment to the Islamic cultural identity and the struggle against racism and hatred.\"\n\nAccording to Ihsanoglu, \"The suggestion that Islam is the problem as it is claimed in the hateful discourse of Islamophobia is to negate Islam's sublime values of peace, compassion, and tolerance, and all the noble virtues that Islam has stood for throughout fourteen centuries of tolerant, brilliant and radiant civilization.\"\n\nIn her latest book, entitled \"Europe, Globalization, and the Coming of the Universal Caliphate,\" Islam scholar Bat Ye'or provides and in-depth examination of the EU's opaque relationship with the OIC, which she describes as a \"would-be universal caliphate\" that exercises significant power through the EU, the UN and other international organizations.\n\nYe'or describes an OIC strategy manual, \"Strategy of Islamic Cultural Action in the West,\" in which the OIC asserts that \"Muslim immigrant communities in Europe are part of the Islamic nation\" and recommends \"a series of steps to prevent the integration and assimilation of Muslims into European culture.\"\n\nAccording to Ye'or, \"The caliphate is alive and growing within Europe…It has advanced through the denial of dangers and the obfuscating of history. It has moved forward on gilded carpets in the corridors of dialogue, the network of the Alliances and partnerships, in the corruption of its leaders, intellectuals and NGOs, particularly at the United Nations.\"\n\nDuring the 12th Islamic Summit held in Cairo on February 6-7, 2013, OIC members unanimously elected Iyad bin Amin Madani to the post of OIC Secretary General. Madani's term will begin in January 2014 when Ihsanoglu's term expires.\n\nThis will be the first time that the OIC -- which describes itself as the \"only and sole official representative of the Muslim world... the real spokesman of the Muslim world\" -- will be headed by a Saudi, and observers believe that under Madani the OIC will become even more extreme.\n\nMeanwhile, Ihsanoglu continues to admonish the EU that \"Islam should be welcomed as a family member in Europe, not as a guest.\" He said the \"exclusion of Islam means ignoring the influential role of Islamic civilization in the evolution of the Western civilization.\"",

        "text": "Von J. DANIELS | Die Saat geht auf. Das Zusammenspiel von Justiz, bayerischem Verfassungsschutz und Staat läuft wie geschmiert: ein weiterer Anschlag auf die Freie Meinungsäußerung in einem Regime, das seine Kritiker mittlerweile stärker kriminialisert als die eigentlichen Täter, die Deutschland bedrohen. PI-NEWS-Autor Michael Stürzenberger wurde heute Mittag in einem Schauprozess von der Strafkammer des Amtsgerichts München wegen „Verbreiten von Propagandamitteln verfassungswidriger Organisationen“ zu einer Freiheitsstrafe von sechs Monaten verurteilt.\n\nZuschauer und Prozessbeobachter im restlos voll besetzten Saal des Strafgerichts reagierten geschockt nach der Urteilsverkündung. Sie wurden Zeugen eines bedeutenden Moments Zeitgeschichte in unserem Land, nur wenige Stunden nach dem islamischen Massenmord von Barcelona.\n\nStürzenberger rezensierte im Juni 2016 auf PI-NEWS den Artikel „Hakenkreuz und Halbmond“ aus der Süddeutschen Zeitung, in dem er auch namentlich erwähnt wurde. Er verwendete in dem gut recherchierten zeitgeschichtlichen Essay auch zwei Originalfotos, die den damaligen Mufti von Jerusalem Mohammed Amin Al-Husseini mit „Hakenkreuz“-Größen zeigte – zur geschichtlichen Berichterstattung im Sinne einer staatsbürgerlichen Aufklärung.\n\nDiese Verwendung ist ausdrücklich vom Erlaubnistatbestand des § 86 (3) des deutschen Strafgesetzbuches gedeckt. Auch die SZ verwendete ähnliche Originalfotos. Stürzenberger zeigte dabei die zeitgeschichtlichen Schnittmengen der beiden Ideologien „Islamismus“ und „National-Sozialismus“ auf. In einem Facebook-Eintrag wies er sowohl auf den PI-News-Artikel hin, sowie auf den SZ-Beitrag „Hakenkreuz und Halbmond“ und die Forschungsergebnisse des renommierten ägyptischen Politologen Hamed Abdel Samad.\n\nStaatsanwaltschaft: „Hetze gegen Islam“\n\nDie Staatsanwaltschaft unterstellte ihm „Hetze gegen den Islam“ – insbesondere, dass der Mufti mit keinem „Halbmond gekennzeichnet sei“. Dies sei bei einem „flüchtigen Betrachter“ ausreichend, um die Religion (des Friedens) herabzuwürdigen. Der „flüchtige Betrachter könne in seiner ‚Timeline‘ nicht erkennen, dass es sich um eine historische Aufarbeitung der Thematik“ handle.\n\nDas Volk wird dumm gehalten und – für dumm gehalten. Mit gleicher Begründung müssten analog natürlich nun auch alle NS-historischen Filme und Dokumentationen auf den GEZ-finanzierten TV-Sendern ARD-ZDF-phoenix-arte-zdf info-etc. strafrechtlich verfolgt werden – der zappende unkundige Betrachter könne nicht unterscheiden, ob hier nicht doch Nazi-Propaganda betrieben oder geschichtliche Fakten beleuchtet würden.\n\nAls Zeuge wurde ein arg nuschelnder „Herr Fisch“ vernommen, ein Polizeibeamter, der auch die Anzeige gegen Stürzenberger bei der Staatsanwaltschaft gehorsam erstattete und vorantrieb. Seine Einlassung war für die geneigten Prozessbeobachter kaum verständlich – die Bitte an das Hohe Gericht, doch die Saalmikrophone zu verwenden, wurde von der Richterin abschlägig beschieden.\n\nEbenso wie der Antrag der Verteidigung auf Beweiswürdigung durch Zitate von einschlägig gewaltverherrlichenden Koran-Suren und der relevanten Passagen aus dem auch von der Stastsanwaltschaft angeführten Werk Abdel Samads „Der islamische Faschismus“. Die Beweismittel wurden selbstverständlich nicht zugelassen. Hingegen wurde von Staatsanwaltschaft und Richterin ausführlichst ein Urteil eines Grazer Gerichts (!!!!) gegen Stürzenberger en detail verlesen und gewürdigt.\n\nQuasi-Berufsverbot für Stürzenberger\n\nDas Schlussplädoyer von Stürzenberger war fulminant – er erhielt „stehende Ovationen“ aus dem Gerichtssaal. In der sichtlich abgekarteten Farce zwischen Staatsanwaltschaft und Gericht lautete das Urteil gegen Michael Stürzenberger auf sechs Monate Freiheitsentzug und 100 Sozialstunden. Dies könne zur „Bewährung“ ausgesetzt werden. Die Bewährungszeit betrüge drei Jahre und sechs Monate, was einem faktischen Berufsverbot für einen islamkundigen Journalisten bei der derzeitigen Sicherheitslage gleichkommt.\n\nZu guter letzt ließ es sich die sichtlich genervte Richterin nicht nehmen, die teilweise von weit angereisten Zuhörer und Prozessbeobachter nach guter „Münchner Manier“ zu beleidigen, sinngemäß: „Die Ausführungen von Stürzenberger in seinem Beitrag zum Islam und dem Faschismus sind so übrigens falsch – aber davon haben Sie da hinten (auf den Zuhörerbänken) ja keine Ahnung, weil Sie sich nicht mit den Dingen beschäftigen.“\n\nVon allen Zuhörern wurden vorsichthalber die Personalausweise kopiert. Stürzenberger wird Rechtsmittel einlegen. Strafanzeigen gegen die Richterin aufgrund von Beleidigung in Tateinheit mit Rechtsbeugung werden erfolgen.\n\nEs ist etwas faul im Staate Deutschland.",

        "text": "Instead of using its limited resources to protect its citizens from the violent onslaught against them, Sweden is waging a legal war on its pensioners for daring to speak out against the same violent onslaught from which the state is failing to protect them.\n\n\"One can criticize fascism or Nazism, but why not Islam? Why should Islam have any protection status?\" — Denny, a 71-year-old pensioner, on trial for \"incitement to hatred\".\n\nAccording to the Swedish mainstream media, the country has experienced a significant rise in prosecutions for \"hate speech\" on social media last year. The organization believed to be largely responsible for this rise is \"Näthatsgranskaren\" (\"The Web Hate Investigator\"), a private organization founded in January 2017 by a former police officer, Tomas Åberg, who has taken it upon himself to identify and report to the authorities Swedish individuals whom he and his organization decide are committing thought crimes and \"inciting hatred\" against foreigners.\n\nÅberg's organization reported no fewer than 750 Swedish citizens in 2017 to the authorities for \"web hate\". According to Aftonbladet, 14% of the reported cases went on to prosecution of which about 7% -- 77 cases -- led to actual convictions. Most of the people identified and reported by the organization were middle aged and elderly ladies. \"The average age is around 55 years\", said Åberg, \"Young women almost do not appear at all\".\n\nAccording to Aftonbladet, \"In his work, Tomas Åberg sees how quickly people are radicalized on the internet and he thinks it's scary. It may begin with statements against foreigners that are within the framework of the law, only to end with serious criminal hatred\". (\"Hate\" is actually not a crime, according to Swedish law; \"incitement to hate\" is). [1]\n\nÅberg founded the organization with a friend, because, he said, he did not think that \"serious internet crimes\" were being taken seriously enough in Sweden. \"We created our own search application, which finds words and phrases that might be suspected of constituting incitement against ethnic groups and unlawful threats\".\n\nAt present, the organization consists of 15 people, including police officers, system developers, lecturers, lawyers and social workers, all of whom are anonymous. The organization refuses to identify the people working for it.\n\nÅberg was recently nominated for a prestigious prize, the \"Swedish Hero\" award, by one of Sweden's largest newspapers, Aftonbladet. Since 2007, the newspaper has awarded the \"Swedish Hero\" prize every year \"to everyday heroes who have shown bravery, civil courage and human compassion\". Apparently, turning in fellow Swedes to the authorities for alleged \"hate speech\" is now viewed in Sweden as \"heroic\".\n\nShortly after Tomas Åberg's nomination to the \"Swedish Hero\" award, however, his name reportedly disappeared from the list of nominees with no explanation offered by Aftonbladet. Åberg, it turned out, who used to own an animal farm, had apparently starved his oxen to death in 2013. After he was reported to the police for the animal abuse, he reportedly changed his name, fled abroad to escape justice, and returned to Sweden only as the statute of limitations on his crime was expiring.\n\nNotably in Sweden, while it is not seen as \"compassionate\" or \"heroic\" to starve animals to death, it is viewed as 'heroic' to report elderly citizens to the police for them to be prosecuted and have their lives potentially ruined for voicing their opinions on social media.\n\nNot only does the mainstream media view reporting thought crimes to the media as \"heroic\"; the Swedish state actively supports it. Åberg's organization received 600,000 Swedish kroner ($73,000) from the Swedish government. This support was motivated by referencing \"activities against racism and intolerance\".\n\nIt is curious that the Swedish state can afford to give more than half a million Swedish kroner away to a private vigilante organization, run by a seemingly shady figure, at a time when the Swedish police are starved for resources and barely have time to investigate the very crimes, including horrific gang rapes, which are causing these 'hateful' social media posts to begin with.\n\nOne of the elderly women, whose life Åberg has disrupted and possibly ruined, is a 73-year old woman with no criminal record, who shared an old text from 2015, widely available on the internet and written by someone else, in a small Facebook group of barely 50 people. She has been charged with \"incitement against an ethnic group\" for sharing the following:\n\n\"A biological sensation in Sweden. A new bird species (parasitus muslimus) has established itself here... In recent years, the Arab bird (parasitus muslimus) has been widely spread in northern Europe, largely because it lacks natural enemies here...The female has a comprehensive feather shield, where only the eyes are visible... The male usually has four females... The species is a migratory bird but with the weird feature that they never move back...\"\n\nAnother woman, 75, was charged with \"inciting hatred against an ethnic group\" after writing the following about marriage among Muslims on Facebook in May 2017:\n\n\"The right to our bodies? Wonder what they mean by that? They say they are not allowed to choose the husband themselves. It must be a cousin, uncle... or maybe a grandfather. Probably they are completely IQ-liberated because inbreeding among Muslims has been going on for thousands of years. \"\n\nYet another woman, Christina, 65, was charged with \"inciting hatred against an ethnic group\" for writing on Facebook: \"If this continues, the intelligence in Sweden will be at goldfish level\" and \"Refuse all that has to do with Islam\". She denies having written those statements but insists that she wishes to warn Swedes against Islam. According to news reports, in 2016 Christina was assaulted by four so-called \"unaccompanied minors\" (migrants) and knocked unconscious, an act that has impaired her memory. No one was sentenced for that assault, but she now faces financial difficulties and cannot pay her rent. She receives no help from the Swedish state. So far, Christina has reportedly been interrogated six times, for up to two hours each, for her alleged thought crimes, asked about her childhood, and whether she was doing drugs. She has no criminal record.\n\n\"It's terrible to feel like a dangerous criminal because you write the truth about what's happening in our society, while rape is high and criminals go free,\" she told Samtiden. It was someone from Näthatsgranskaren who reported her to the police. She risks being fined or possibly going to jail.\n\nDenny, a 71-year-old pensioner, is currently on trial for \"incitement to hatred\" for having asked, \"One can criticize fascism or Nazism, but why not Islam? Why should Islam have any protection status?\"\n\nA 64-year old man was reported to the police by Näthatsgranskaren for encouraging Swedes to learn self-defense. He is now being charged with \"incitement to hatred against an ethnic group\" for writing on Facebook:\n\n\"Before it's too late, I suggest that anyone... who is able to manage to defend this country, joins the shooting clubs, self-defense clubs, karate clubs or anything... Everything is allowed for a Muslim as long as he harasses 'infidels'... a Muslim feels as bad about chopping off a human head as we do about opening a can of sardines\".\n\nDuring interrogations, he reportedly said that he has no intention of hurting anyone and that his post was merely about self-defense. The police questioned him about whether he has anything against Muslims: \"I have nothing against Muslims...,\" he said. \"That is not what this is about. It is about Islam and the Koran that does not have the same values as us... It says in the Koran that all infidels must be killed...\" He asked the police to deal with imams who preach hatred in the mosques instead.\n\nEven before Åberg's organization came into the picture, Sweden was prosecuting Swedes for \"incitement to hate\" as if the future of the Swedish state depended on it. Here are a few recent cases:\n\nA 71-year-old woman referred to so-called unaccompanied minors as \"bearded children\" and said that they are \"engaged in rape and demolishing their [asylum] homes\". She posted the comment on the Facebook page of the Sweden Democrats in June 2016. In February 2018, a Swedish court sentenced her to a fine for \"incitement of hatred against an ethnic group\".\n\nDuring her trial, she said that she had been reading several articles about these purported unaccompanied refugees who \"burned down asylum housing and raped and then refused to have their age medically determined in order to escape sentencing\".\n\n\"It made me terrified,\" she said, apologizing for her post, which she said was aimed solely at those who commit crimes. The court evidently did not care about the elderly woman's fear, and concluded:\n\n\"...the [woman] must have realized that there was an imminent risk that people who read the text would perceive it as an expression of disagreement with other ethnic groups of people in general and the vast majority of single unaccompanied refugees, who, at the time of the comment, had come to Sweden in particular. Despite this, she wrote the comment on Facebook.\" the co.\n\nA woman in her fifties was sentenced to a fine in December 2017 for a post on Facebook, in which she called men from Afghanistan, who had lied about their age, \"camel riders\": \"These damn camel riders will never be self-sufficient, because they are damn parasites,\" she wrote. Prosecutor Mattias Glaser emphasized that the post was directed against \"young men struggling to stay in the country\". According to the court:\n\n\"... condescending words were used in a manner that... expressed contempt for people of Afghan origin or people from neighboring areas with respect to skin color and national or ethnic origin in a manner which fits the provision about incitement to hatred\".\n\nIn November 2017, a 65-year old man was sentenced to a fine for \"incitement of hatred against an ethnic group\". His crime? Writing on Facebook that, \"newly arrived\" migrants, not Swedes, were guilty of committing gang rapes. According to the court, the man \"claimed that Afghans, Africans and Arabs who have newly arrived in Sweden commit crimes such as gang rapes\". This claim, according to the court, constitutes, \"clear contempt\" for people of the mentioned national origins. The 65-year old man argued that he published the comment because Sweden withholds statistics about the ethnic origins of rapists and that his comment was a way to spread information and start a debate. This made no impression on the court, which concluded: \"The post contains a serious accusation that people of certain national origins commit serious crimes and it [the post] cannot as such be considered to arouse or contribute to an objective discussion on the subject.\"\n\nIn February, a 55-year old man was sentenced to a fine for, \"incitement against an ethnic group\" for writing on Facebook that Sunni Muslims are behind most of the gang crime in Sweden, as well as rapes. \"Somalis are Sunni Muslims... they are behind much of the gang crime in Sweden and all the other violence, such as rapes. Afghans are 80% Sunni and they are a damned people!\" he wrote.\n\nDuring the trial, he said he was under the impression that there was freedom of speech in Sweden. \"You see this stuff everyday\", he said; \"gang rapes, shootings, animal abuse and the like and the politicians do not seem able to do anything about it. The police do not do anything either and people get angry\". The court concluded:\n\n\"... the post expresses that Muslims in general are behind gang crime and rapes in Sweden and is formulated in an offensive manner... the post does not invite a critical discussion about religion, it expresses the exact kind of contempt that the provision about incitement against an ethnic group is aimed at. The defendant is sentenced to 10,000 kroner [$1,200] for incitement against an ethnic group\".\n\nThe list goes on....\n\nSweden is being swept by a strong wave of murder, violent assault, rape, gang rape and sexual assault, in addition to the ever-present terror threat. Instead of using its limited resources to protect its citizens from the violent onslaught against them, Sweden is waging a legal war on its pensioners for daring to speak out against the same violent onslaught from which the state is failing to protect them.\n\nJudith Bergman is a columnist, lawyer and political analyst.\n\n[1] Brottsbalken chapter 16, § 8,1 st, explicitly talks of \"incitement\" (Swedish: \"hets mot folkgrupp\") against groups of people defined by their \"race, skin color, national or ethnic origin, faith or sexual preference\". However, the provision does not criminalize criticism of religion, ideology or ideas.",

        "text": "Roger Kimball highlights a Gatestone Institute report by the editors of Dispatch International about the explosion of rape in Sweden. As the country’s make-up has dramatically changed due to mass immigration, particularly from Muslim countries in the Middle East and northern and eastern Africa, the number of rapes reported to police has increased by an astonishing 1,472 percent — from 421 in 1975 to 6,620 last year.\n\nRoger observes:\n\nNote that conspicuous by its absence is any mention of who it is who is committing the rapes. Gatestone quotes Michael Hess, a local politician from the Sweden Democrat Party: “When will you journalists realize that it is deeply rooted in Islam’s culture to rape and brutalize women who refuse to comply with Islamic teachings. There is a strong connection between rapes in Sweden and the number of immigrants from MENA-countries [Middle East and North Africa].” For that bit of plain speaking, Hess was handed a fine and a suspended jail sentence by a Swedish court. Was what he said untrue? Truth was not something the court cared about: “The Court [Tingsrätten] notes that the question of whether or not Michael Hess’s pronouncement is true, or appeared to be true to Michael Hess, has no bearing on the case. Michael Hess’s statement must be judged based on its timing and context.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, as I’ve related here a number of times, President Obama, with energetic assistance from Hillary Clinton, has been trying to saddle the United States with sharia blasphemy standards since taking office in 2009. Strategically, the administration pushes for these speech restrictions, which violate the First Amendment, in the context of violence committed after the publication of words, exhibitions or artistic representations that are unquestionably insulting toward Islam. In actuality, there is more insult to Islam in the administration’s intimation that barbaric Muslim reactions to merely obnoxious speech are to be expected. But I want to focus, once again, on free expression.\n\nWe need to understand that, contrary to Obama administration suggestions, what is at stake is not just speech that almost all of us would agree is in bad taste and that would not be missed if it were barred. What is at stake is the ability to tell the truth. What is at stake is the ability of a free society to engage in robust discussion in order to develop public policy, particularly security and crime-prevention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I wrote here after jihadists carried out the Charlie Hebdo massacre:\n\nThe Islamist–progressive alliance I explored in The Grand Jihad would have you believe that accommodating sharia blasphemy rules would result in only a narrow limitation on free expression crudely obnoxious toward Islam, the sort of thing few of us would lament — e.g., expression analogous to the nauseating Piss Christ. This, however, is simply false. Sharia forbids any speech — whether true or not — that casts Islam in an unfavorable light, dissents from settled Muslim doctrine, has the potential to sow discord within the ummah, or entices Muslims to renounce Islam or convert to other faiths. The idea is not merely to ban gratuitous ridicule — which, by the way, sensible people realize government should not do (and, under our Constitution, may not do) even if they themselves are repulsed by gratuitous ridicule. The objective is to ban all critical examination of Islam, period – even though Islamic supremacism, a mainstream interpretation of Islam, happens to be a top national-security threat that we sorely need to examine if we want to understand and defeat our enemies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Swedish prosecution of Michael Hess that Roger and the Gatestone report discuss usefully highlights this problem. Hess did not gratuitously insult Islam or Muslims. He addressed the cause of a surge in rape, a phenomenon that profoundly affects public safety in Sweden and that (as noted by those of us who have discussed the nexus between rape and jihad) is promoted by a scripturally-based interpretation of Islam. Yet the court silenced him, not because what he said was false or slanderous, but because saying it might promote hostility toward Islam.\n\nThis is exactly what President Obama and Mrs. Clinton have tried to do, particularly in their collusion with Islamist governments in U.N. Human Rights Council Resolution 16/18, which aims to prohibit any speech that casts Islam in an unfavorable light (under the guise of “inciting hostility” to religion).\n\nAs we saw again this weekend, this time in Copenhagen, Europe is now living with the consequences of welcoming massive immigration from sharia cultures, tolerating the demands of Islamic leaders that Muslims resist assimilation, passively watching the inexorable rise of radical Islam, and cracking down only on Europeans and others who dare to raise questions about the wisdom of it all.\n\nDon’t think it can’t happen here.",

        "text": "When employees of social media companies are appointed as the state's private thought police and given the power to shape the form of current political and cultural discourse by deciding who shall be allowed to speak and what to say, and who shall be shut down, free speech becomes nothing more than a fairy tale. Or is that perhaps the point?\n\nGermany has made no secret of its desire to see its new law copied by the rest of the EU.\n\nA new German law introducing state censorship on social media platforms came into effect on October 1, 2017. The new law requires social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, to censor their users on behalf of the German state. Social media companies are obliged to delete or block any online \"criminal offenses\" such as libel, slander, defamation or incitement, within 24 hours of receipt of a user complaint -- regardless of whether or the content is accurate or not. Social media companies receive seven days for more complicated cases. If they fail to do so, the German government can fine them up to 50 million euros for failing to comply with the law.\n\nThis state censorship makes free speech subject to the arbitrary decisions of corporate entities that are likely to censor more than absolutely necessary, rather than risk a crushing fine. When employees of social media companies are appointed as the state's private thought police and given the power to shape the form of current political and cultural discourse by deciding who shall be allowed to speak and what to say, and who shall be shut down, free speech becomes nothing more than a fairy tale. Or is that perhaps the point?\n\nMeanwhile, the district court in Munich recently gave a German journalist, Michael Stürzenberger, a six-month suspended jail sentence for posting on his Facebook page a historical photo of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, shaking the hand of a senior Nazi official in Berlin in 1941. The prosecution accused Stürzenberger of \"inciting hatred towards Islam\" and \"denigrating Islam\" by publishing the photograph. The court found Stürzenberger guilty of \"disseminating the propaganda of anti-constitutional organizations\". While the mutual admiration that once existed between al-Husseini and German Nazis is an undisputed historical fact, now evidently history is being rewritten by German courts. Stürzenberger has appealed the verdict.\n\nA German court recently gave journalist Michael Stürzenberger (pictured) a six-month suspended jail sentence for posting on his Facebook page a historical photo of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, shaking the hand of a Nazi official in Berlin, in 1941.

(Image Source: PI News video screenshot)\n\nGermany has made no secret of its desire to see its new law copied by the rest of the EU, which already has a similar code of conduct for social media giants. The EU Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourova, recently said she might be willing to legislate in the future if the voluntary code of conduct does not produce the desired results. She said, however, that the voluntary code was working \"relatively\" well, with Facebook removing 66.5% of the material they had been notified was \"hateful\" between December and May this year. Twitter removed 37.4%, and YouTube took action on 66% of the notifications from users.\n\nWhile purportedly concerned about online \"hate speech,\" one EU organization, the EU Parliament, had no qualms about letting its premises be used to host a convicted Arab terrorist, Leila Khaled, from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) at a conference about \"The Role of Women in the Palestinian Popular Struggle\" in September. (The EU, the US, Canada, and Australia, have all designated the PFLP a terrorist organization). The conference was organized by, among others, the Spanish delegation of Izquierda Unida (United Left) as part of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left bloc in the European Parliament.\n\nIn the UK, Prime Minister Theresa May also said that she will tell internet firms to tackle extremist content:\n\n\"Industry needs to go further and faster in automating the detection and removal of terrorist content online... ultimately it is not just the terrorists themselves who we need to defeat. It is the extremist ideologies that fuel them. It is the ideologies that preach hatred, sow division and undermine our common humanity. We must be far more robust in identifying these ideologies and defeating them -- across all parts of our societies.\"\n\nPrime Minister May keeps insisting that \"these ideologies\" are spread \"across all parts of our societies\" when in reality, virtually all terrorism is Islamic. Meanwhile, her own Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, has refused to ban the political wing of Hezbollah. Hezbollah's hate speech, apparently, is perfectly acceptable to the British authorities. So is that of South African Muslim cleric and hate preacher Ebrahim Bham, who was once an interpreter to the Taliban's head legal advisor. He was allowed to enter the UK to speak in the Queen Elizabeth II Centre, a government building, at the \"Palestine Expo\" a large Jew-hate event in London in July. Bham is known for quoting Nazi Propaganda Minister Goebbels and saying that all Jews and Christians are \"agents of Satan\". Meanwhile, a scholar such as Robert Spencer is banned from entering the UK, supposedly on the grounds that what he reports -- accurately -- is \"Islamophobic\".\n\nThe British Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) also recently stated that online \"hate crimes\" will be prosecuted \"with the same robust and proactive approach used with offline offending\". The decision to treat online offenses in the same way as offline offenses is expected to increase hate crime prosecutions, already at the highest recorded level ever. Prosecutors completed 15,442 hate crime cases in 2015-16.\n\nJews in Britain, who have experienced a dramatic increase in anti-Semitism over the past three years, are frequently on the receiving end of hate crimes. Nevertheless, their cases constitute less than a fraction of the statistics. In 2016/17, the CPS prosecuted 14,480 hate crimes. According to the Campaign Against Antisemitism:\n\n\"we have yet to see a single year in which more than a couple of dozen anti-Semitic hate crimes were prosecuted. So far in 2017, we are aware of... 21 prosecutions, in 2016 there were 20, and in 2015 there were just 12. So serious are the failures by the CPS to take action that we have had to privately prosecute alleged anti-Semites ourselves and challenge the CPS through judicial review, the first of which we won in March. Last year only 1.9% of hate crime against Jews was prosecuted, signaling to police forces that their effort in investigating hate crimes against Jews might be wasted, and sending the strong message to anti-Semites that they need not fear the law... Each year since 2014 has been a record-breaking year for anti-Semitic crime: between 2014 and 2016, anti-Semitic crime surged by 45%\".\n\nAlmost one in three British Jews have apparently considered leaving Britain due to anti-Semitism in the past two years.\n\nBritish authorities seem far more concerned with \"Islamophobia\" than with the increase in hate crimes against Jews. In fact, the police has teamed up with Transport for London authorities to encourage people to report hate crimes during \"National Hate Crime Awareness Week\", which runs from October 14-21. Transport for London and the Metropolitan Police will hold more than 200 community events to \"reassure communities that London's public transport system is safe for everyone\". The events are specifically targeted at Muslims; officers have visited the East London Mosque to encourage reporting hate crimes.\n\nLast year, London mayor Sadiq Khan's Office for Policing and Crime (Mopac) announced it was spending £1,730,726 of taxpayer money policing speech online after applying for a grant from the Home Office. Meanwhile, Khan said that he does not have the funds to monitor the 200 jihadists estimated to be in London, out of the 400 jihadists who have so far returned to the capital from Syria and Iraq. (He also implicitly admitted that he does not know the whereabouts of the jihadists who have returned). When asked by the journalist Piers Morgan why the mayor could not have them monitored, Khan answered:\n\n\"Because the Met Police budget, roughly speaking, 15 percent, 20 percent is funded by me, the mayor. The rest comes from central government. If the Met Police is being shrunk and reduced, they've got to prioritize and use their resources in a sensible, savvy way.\"\n\nWhen Morgan asked what could possibly be a bigger priority than, \"people coming back from a Syrian battlefield with intent to harm British citizens\", Khan did not answer. Perhaps because it is hard to admit in public that fighting \"Islamophobia\" is now a higher priority than fighting terrorism?",

        "text": "Counter-jihad measures have been obstructed by Western leaders everywhere since immediately after 9/11. President George W. Bush declared that \"Islam is peace\". President Obama removed all references to Islam in FBI terror training manuals that Muslims deemed offensive. New York City's current leadership threatened New Yorkers, immediately after the October terror attack in Manhattan, not to link the terror attack to Islam. UK Prime Minister Theresa May claimed that Islam is a \"religion of peace\".\n\nThe British Foreign Office, which has ignored Iranian women's desperate fight for freedom and stayed shamefully silent during the Iranian people's recent protests against Iran's regime, unbelievably handed out free headscarves to its staff. Meanwhile, at least 29 Iranian women were arrested for shedding the hijab, and were likely subjected to rape and other torture, as is common in Iranian prisons. Yet British MPs and Foreign Office employees were perversely celebrating the hijab as some sort of twisted tool of \"female empowerment\".\n\nOne of the most troubling aspects of this rapidly spreading dhimmitude, is the de-facto enforcement of Islamic blasphemy laws. Local European authorities have been utilizing \"hate speech\" laws to prohibit criticism of Islam, even though Islam represents an idea, not a nationality or an ethnicity. The conventional purpose of most hate-speech laws is to protect people from hatred, not ideas.\n\nAlthough Europe is not part of the Muslim world, many European authorities nevertheless seem to feel obliged to submit to Islam in more or less subtle ways. This voluntary submission appears to be unprecedented: Dhimmi, historically speaking, is the Arabic term for the conquered non-Muslim, who agrees to live as a second-rate, \"tolerated\" citizen, under Islamic rule, submitting to a separate, demeaning set of laws and the demands of his Islamic masters.\n\nIn Europe, submitting to the demands of Islam, in the name of \"diversity\" and \"human rights\", has also been happening voluntarily. This submission to Islam is, of course, highly ironic, as the Western concepts of \"diversity\" and \"human rights\" do not exist within the foundational texts of Islam. On the contrary, these texts denounce in the strongest – and supremacist - terms those who refuse to submit to the Islamic concept of divinity, Allah, as infidels who must either convert, pay the jizya [\"protection\"] tax or die.\n\nOne of the most troubling aspects of this rapidly spreading dhimmitude, is the de-facto enforcement of Islamic blasphemy laws within European jurisdictions. Local European authorities have been utilizing \"hate speech\" laws to prohibit criticism of Islam, even though Islam represents an idea – a religion and ideology - not a nationality or an ethnicity. The conventional purpose of most \"hate-speech\" laws is to protect people from hatred, not ideas. It would therefore appear that European authorities are under no legal obligation to prosecute people for criticizing Islam, especially as Islamic law, Sharia, is not part of European law; yet they do so only too willingly.\n\nThe most recent example of this kind of dhimmitude comes from Sweden, where a pensioner has been indicted for calling Islam a 'fascist' ideology on Facebook. The legal provision under which he is being charged, (Brottsbalken chapter 16, § 8,1 st), explicitly talks of \"incitement\" (Swedish: \"hets mot folkgrupp\") against groups of people defined by their 'race, skin color, national or ethnic origin, faith or sexual preference'. However, the provision does not criminalize criticism of religion, ideology or ideas, because Western democracies, back when they were genuine democracies, did not criminalize the free exchange of ideas.\n\nDhimmitude in Europe is manifested in many other respects, as well. On World Hijab Day a yearly recurring February event founded in 2013 by a Bangladeshi immigrant to the US, Nazma Khan, \"to fight discrimination against Muslim women through awareness and education\", several British MPs chose to don the hijab. These included MP Anne McLaughlin and Labour's former shadow Equalities Minister Dawn Butler and MP Naseem Shah. Furthermore, the British Foreign Office, which appears to ignore Iranian women's desperate fight for freedom, and which stayed comparatively quiet during the Iranian people's recent protests against the Iranian regime[1], unbelievably handed out free headscarves to its staff. According to the Evening Standard, an email reportedly sent to staff said:\n\n\"Would you like to try on a hijab or learn why Muslim women wear the headscarf? Come along to our walk-in event. Free scarves for all those that choose to wear it for the day or part of the day. Muslim women, along with followers of many other religions, choose to wear the hijab. Many find liberation, respect and security through wearing it. #StrongInHijab. Join us for #WorldHijabDay.\"\n\nMeanwhile, at least 29 Iranian women were arrested for shedding the hijab, and were likely subjected to rape and other torture, as is common in Iranian prisons. Yet British MPs and Foreign Office employees were perversely celebrating the hijab as some sort of twisted tool of \"female empowerment\".\n\nThe above incident is hardly surprising: Britain is rife with some of the most jarring examples of dhimmitude. Mass rapes of children by Muslim gangs in many British cities, went on for years with the knowledge of the British authorities, who did not stop these crimes for fear of appearing \"racist\" or \"Islamophobic\"\n\nThe dhimmitude is also apparent in the lengths to which British authorities will go to excuse or explain away customs that are practiced by British Muslim communities. The police commander responsible for tackling honor crimes, female genital mutilation (FGM) and forced marriage, Ivan Balchatchet, recently wrote a letter in which he said that the reason there have not yet been any convictions for FGM (which was criminalized in 1985), despite an estimate that 137,000 women and girls are affected by FGM in England and Wales, is that the crime has \"many nuances\". He later apologized for the statement:\n\n\"I apologise for this letter... FGM is the appalling abuse of children. It is unacceptable that there have been no successful prosecutions. Working with others, this is something that needs to change.\"\n\nSimilarly, according to new figures, hundreds of \"honor\" violence and forced marriage crimes go unpunished in London. Data shows that between 2015 and 2017, police recorded 759 \"honor\" crimes and 265 forced marriages in London alone -- but only 138 people were charged with offenses. Diana Nammi, executive director of the Iranian & Kurdish Women's Rights Organisation, which provides refuge for victims, said\n\n\"What makes it so alarming is that figures that we obtained through freedom of information requests show that, at the same time, since the criminalisation of forced marriage in 2014, many more people at risk than ever before are coming forward for help\".\n\nDhimmitude, however, leads not \"only\" to child rape, female genital mutilation and \"honor\" killings, all spreading under the willfully blind eyes of national authorities, but also to the obstruction of counterterrorism efforts. In a recent interview for SVT public television, Peder Hyllengren, a researcher at the Swedish Defense College, said:\n\n\"You risk being identified as racist in a way that you have not seen in other European countries. There, this question has been as uncontroversial as the importance of combating Nazism and right wing extremism. But in Sweden it took a long time before it was acceptable to discuss jihadism in the same way that we have been discussing Nazism\".\n\nHyllengren is being too harsh on Sweden: Counter-jihad measures have been obstructed by Western leaders everywhere since immediately after 9/11, when President George W. Bush declared that \"Islam is peace\". President Obama removed all references to Islam in FBI terror training manuals that Muslims deemed offensive. Theresa May claimed that Islam is a \"religion of peace\". New York City's current leadership threatened New Yorkers, immediately after the October terror attack in Manhattan, not to link the terror attack to Islam.\n\nMost recently, the British government's terror watchdog and independent reviewer of terrorism legislation Max Hill QC, said that it is \"fundamentally wrong\" to use the phrase \"Islamist terrorism\" to describe attacks carried out in Britain and elsewhere. According to a report by the Evening Standard, he said that the word terrorism should not be attached \"to any of the world religions\" and that the term \"Daesh-inspired terrorism\" should be used instead. Last year, Max Hill opined that some jihadis returning from Syria and Iraq should escape prosecution as they were \"naive\".\n\nIn Germany, dhimmitude now runs so deep that the minister of family affairs recently suggested that sexual assaults by Muslim migrants could be prevented by inviting more Muslim migrants into the country -- the mothers and sisters of the male Muslim migrants already there. This was the German minister's answer to a question in the Bundestag about what \"concrete educational and danger prevention measures\" her ministry was planning to \"protect and inform women and girls in the long term about the disproportionately increased physical and sexual and life threatening attacks that have taken place since 2015\" by migrants. This was the minister's pathetic answer:\n\n\"... On the one hand this concerns the accommodation where the young unaccompanied refugees live. Also of course to the...yes... the macho culture from which they often come... That one does not conceal this and attempts to discuss this there, and of course influence them, this is quite obvious... We have the expert's report from Professor Pfeiffer here, which gives very precise starting points... we must work with the youth and we also know that family reunification is important... he [the professor] says it is just the same with young men whether they are from here or elsewhere, they are easier to handle when they have their mothers and sisters with them\".\n\nEurope is rife with other recent examples of dhimmitude, exhibited by countless state and commercial actors. There was the removal of a cross by the presiding judge in a German courtroom during the trial of an Afghan charged with threatening another Muslim for converting to Christianity; H&M recalling a range of socks after Muslims complained that the pattern on them resembled the word \"Allah\" written in Arabic upside down; a French court dropping hate crime charges from the indictment of a Muslim murder suspect, who confessed to killing his 66 year old Jewish neighbor, a woman whom he tortured, before throwing her to her death off her balcony, while shouting \"Allahu Akbar\". He had also reportedly called the victim's daughter \"dirty Jewess\" two years prior to the murder.\n\nThe list goes on. Sheikh Yussuf Qaradawi, the spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, who has said that Europe will be conquered not through the sword, but through dawa, probably could not be happier. Europe is leaping to fulfill his request.\n\nPictured: Women wearing Islamic niqab veils stand outside the French Embassy during a demonstration on April 11, 2011 in London, England.

        "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Telford abuse: 'I was sold twice a night'\n\nA lawyer who led prosecutions against a child sex abuse ring in Telford has said those cases were the \"tip of the iceberg\".\n\nFormer chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal, who also oversaw similar high-profile cases in Rochdale, said he knew \"more would come out\".\n\nSpeaking amid calls for a new inquiry, he said there were probably thousands of street grooming victims in the UK.\n\nWest Mercia Police said it took all allegations \"extremely seriously\".\n\nA Sunday Mirror investigation said the scale of sexual exploitation in Telford made it the UK's \"worst-ever child grooming scandal\".\n\nThe paper claimed abuse in the town has been widespread since 1980, when it began with \"groups of mainly Asian men\" targeting vulnerable white teenagers.\n\nMr Afzal led several prosecutions concerning offences in Telford, including one against two brothers convicted of trafficking girls for sex.\n\nSpeaking on the Victoria Derbyshire programme, he said: \"I prosecuted, when I led nationally, the Telford original issue, I knew then that this was a bigger issue not just in Telford but everywhere.\"\n\nImage caption Nazir Afzal said he thinks abuse of this nature is happening all over the country\n\nHe appeared alongside \"Holly\" - who spoke out anonymously about her abuse at the hand of gangs in the town.\n\n\"Now, seven or eight years later, I see stories like Holly's where she is not being listened to, she's not being believed, her abusers have acted with impunity because they think the authorities are not going to do anything about it.\n\n\"She is one of probably one of thousands of young girls and young boys who are being abused in street grooming up and down the country.\"\n\nAnsar Ali, a spokesman for Together Against Grooming, also appeared on the programme and was asked why Asian gangs are often blamed for child sexual exploitation.\n\n\"These gangs that operate are not what you call your classic, typical paedophile, that's not their motivation,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes they are sexual predators but it is more that they use these girls as a sexual commodity and it is about making money off them.\n\n\"That is their main driver.\n\n\"I don't think there is a link to their heritage because most people from their background don't commit these sort of acts.\n\n\"The vast majority of people find their actions reprehensible, including the communities from which they originate.\"\n\nTelford MP Lucy Allan has asked for an urgent question in Parliament about the situation and called for an urgent inquiry.\n\nOperation Chalice\n\nImage copyright Police and Getty Images Image caption Seven men were jailed in 2012 as part of West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice, including brothers Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali\n\nSeven men were jailed in 2012 as part of West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice, including brothers Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali.\n\nThe force said more than 100 girls could have been targeted by the gang between 2007 and 2009.\n\nMany of the seven men worked for or had connections with fast food restaurants across Telford.\n\nVictims as young as 13 were plied with drugs and alcohol and sold for sex by men who posed as their boyfriends.\n\nThe men initially won the girls' trust by giving them presents such as mobile phones in an \"almost boyfriend-girlfriend scenario\", police said.\n\nSpeaking in 2013, Det Ch Insp Neil Jamieson said: \"It then spiralled into them being shared with other men.\"\n\nThe girls were moved around the country for the purposes of sexual exploitation, he added.\n\nMubarek Ali was released in November last year after serving about five years behind bars. He was banned from returning to Telford and Shrewsbury.\n\nMark Berry, a volunteer who helped to run a night cafe in Wellington said he witnessed signs of the abuse in the town before Operation Chalice began.\n\nIn about 2012, he said, groups of young men were hanging around nightclubs without entering them, and approaching girls who exited the venues alone or in small groups.\n\n\"We began talking to the girls, as you do when looking after people and we started to hear things that were going on,\" he said.\n\n\"At that point we didn't know what to call it.\"\n\nGirls 'blatantly' approached\n\nHe said the group reported what they saw to anti-trafficking teams, who at the time were focusing on women being brought into the UK.\n\n\"We weren't calling it CSE, there was a different language,\" Mr Berry said.\n\n\"We raised concerns about what we were seeing and asked if there was anything we could do to help.\n\n\"Really, at the time, there were things going on that felt not normal.\n\n\"Chalice then took off and it all became clear it was bigger than we thought.\"\n\n'I don't let my daughter go to nightclubs'\n\nReacting to the news, locals in Wellington, Telford, said they were saddened, but not surprised that organised sexual abuse was occuring.\n\nOne woman, who did not wish to be named, said: \"We know it has being going on for a long time but it is disgusting.\n\n\"I hate to think of it, innocent children having to put up with it, it has been going on for years but it has not come to light.\n\n\"There should be more done about it, but I don't know what they can do.\"\n\nCarer Tracy Shaw, 40, and her daughter Amber, 20, said they feel fearful living in the town.\n\nTracy said: \"When I am working, I always have something in my pocket. I don't let my daughter go to nightclubs.\"\n\nAmber added: \"It makes me not want to go out.\n\n\"You don't expect it to happen anywhere but especially not in Telford.\"\n\nMr Berry agreed with Mr Afzal's assessment that the cases so far had been \"potentially just the tip of the prosecutions\".\n\nHe also backed calls for a new inquiry, and called on the authorities to get local organisations involved.\n\n\"Often community groups know more about what is going on on the ground,\" he said.\n\nIn 2016, street pastors claimed that men were \"blatantly\" approaching young girls in Shropshire for sex.\n\nA recent meeting of a Telford and Wrekin Council scrutiny committee heard evidence of \"gang-related\" child sexual exploitation was no longer being found in the wake of Operation Chalice.\n\nThe vast majority was now found online, councillors were told.",

        "text": "Extract from “The Journal” Issued by the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)\n\n— Professor Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu (Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference)\n\nThe Problem of Islamophobia\n\nOne of the biggest threats to global peace and security in our present time is the scourge of Islamophobia. It is a matter of great concern not only to the Muslim world but also to humanity itself that the issue of Islamophobia is growing at an alarming rate. Today the Muslims are faced with a formidable challenge to counter an orchestrated campaign that is active in defaming Islam and distorting its sacred values of peace, tolerance and acknowledging the other, that lies at the basis of the Islamic faith. The danger is being exacerbated by media misreporting and provocations under the pretext of freedom of expression.\n\nIslam has been a pioneer in championing democratic freedoms. Freedom of expression is sacrosanct but it cannot be a license to hurt and abuse the sentiments and feelings held sacred by people of different faiths. To ignore or negate this fundamental value would be at the peril of civilized existence.\n\nHadith on Khushu and concentration in salat and prayers – Bukhari\n\nIt is unfortunate that a section of the global media and vested groups have chosen to stigmatize Muslims as terrorists and extremists. What is more outrageous is that some of the groups are now engaged in corrupting the minds of the young and cultivating hatred and prejudices by organizing symposiums in different colleges and universities in the US by equating Islam with Fascism. A great harm has been done by keeping alive a mistrust of Islam in the west through the inflammatory writings and blasphemous caricatures of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).\n\nThe negative reports emanating from the West have more than often been the result of ignorance and insufficient knowledge of Islam and Muslims. Many reports have been on hearsay and distorted information.\n\nThere is therefore an urgent need for the international community to develop an awareness to counter this unholy campaign and muster the necessary political will to take collective action to counter Islamophobia for the sake of peaceful coexistence of people of all faiths and cultural backgrounds.\n\nMeeting the Challenge of Islamophobia\n\nGiven this background, the OIC has taken upon itself to meet the challenge of countering Islamphobia in all its aspects. The OIC remains resolute in its condemnation of Islamophobia. At the same time, we will remain proactive in raising global awareness about the true values of Islam that are based on the principles of tolerance, peace and respect for religious beliefs of others. The Member States of the OIC have sent out a strong message that Islam and Muslims are opposed to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and against oppression and brutal suppression of legitimate struggles for self determination.\n\nOIC and the International Community on Islamophobia\n\nThe OIC is ready to join hands with the international community to develop a culture of peace and understanding among civilizations. In my statements during the ongoing 62nd Session of the UN General Assembly and also in my bilateral meetings with leaders of the Member States and western countries as well in my interventions at several reputed American think tanks in Washington DC and New York, I have underscored the dangers of Islamophobia in no uncertain terms. I believe that it falls on governments and the civil society of all countries to disseminate the message of tolerance and understanding down to the grass roots of society. In doing so, we will be able to form an Alliance of Civilizations conducive to permit our future generations to live in peaceful coexistence and harmony.\n\n…\n\nRelated Islamic Articles\n\nRead more:",

        "text": "Jacob Mchangama is right to sound the alarm about the U.N.’s shift of focus away from attempting to make “defamation of religions” a human-rights violation and toward banning hate speech. But hate-speech bans are not new. Religious-hate-speech laws have long been used as proxies for Islamic blasphemy rules in the member states of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), and increasingly in Europe, Canada, and Australia as well. The U.S. does not have hate-speech laws. However, Mchangama rightly suggests that, with the death of the “defamation of religions” resolutions, we will be seeing a big international push to criminalize religious hate speech, including here in the U.S. As we gird for battle, here are some points to consider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. This shift has been under way in the U.N. Human Rights Council for years. It was started by the EU as an effort to get the OIC off its anti–“defamation of religions” kick. Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights — which states that “any advocacy of … religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination [or] hostility … shall be prohibited by law” — is already international law, so no further declarations, instruments, etc., would be required. (Article 20 was supported by the Soviet bloc and opposed by the West — even though many of the Western Europeans states that spoke out against its inclusion already had hate-speech laws at the time.)\n\n2. Virtually all 47 member states of the Council of Europe have laws punishing hate speech. (They are unevenly enforced.) Europeans have had racial-hate-speech bans since Nazism arose in the 1930s. Since the middle of the last decade, these have been expanded to ban criticism of Muslims, who argue that since Jews are protected by hate-speech bans, they should be too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. The EU sees hate-speech bans as an appealing alternative to laws banning “defamation of religions” because they are consistent with the theory that individuals, not institutions, are to be protected under human-rights law. In practice, these laws give courts in Europe wiggle room. For example, neither Rushdie nor the Danish cartoonists were convicted of hate speech. It will be interesting to see what happens with the Wilders case in the Netherlands. If he’s convicted, it could signal a new era of more consistent enforcement of the hate-speech bans. But even if only some of these cases end in convictions and the rest in acquittals, these trials have a chilling effect on free speech, which makes hate-speech bans very dangerous.\n\n4. The U.S. does not ban hate speech. The Supreme Court held in the 1969 case Brandenburg v. Ohio that, under the First Amendment, our freedoms of speech and the press bar the government from forbidding “mere advocacy” of violence or of other criminal behavior save where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent and likely lawless action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Upon ratifying the ICCPR, the U.S. made a reservation to Article 20, saying that the article “does not authorize or require legislation or other action by the United States that would restrict the right of free speech and association protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States.”\n\n6. In 2009, the Obama administration had the U.S. co-sponsor with Egypt, which represented the OIC, a non-binding hate-speech resolution in the Human Rights Council. #more#In contrast to U.S. constitutional law, that resolution urges states to take and to effectively implement “all necessary measures” to combat any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility, or violence. It thus encourages the worldwide criminalization of religious hate speech.\n\nUCLA law professor Eugene Volokh blogged about how the 2009 hate-speech resolution might impact the U.S.:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“So to be consistent with our position here [in co-sponsoring the 2009 resolution], the Administration would presumably have to take what steps it can to ensure that supposed “hate speech” that incites hostility will indeed be punished. It would presumably be committed to filing amicus briefs supporting changes in First Amendment law to allow such punishment, and in principle perhaps the appointment of Justices who would endorse such changes (or even the proposal of express constitutional amendments that would work such changes).\n\n“To be sure, I think it’s quite unlikely that the Administration would indeed work to enact a specific Anti-Hate-Speech Amendment, or make support of article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights into a litmus test for Supreme Court appointees. But it seems to me that the Administration’s and the Nation’s international representatives’ calling for the suppression of “hate speech” throughout the world would have some significance. At least it would let other countries fault us for inconsistency when American law fails to punish such speech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“And beyond that, I’m worried that the Executive Branch’s endorsement of speech-restrictive “international human rights” norms will affect how the courts interpret the First Amendment, so that over time, “an international norm against hate speech … [would] supply a basis for prohibiting [hate speech], the First Amendment notwithstanding.” And that worry stems not just from my fevered imagination, but from the views of Prof. Peter Spiro, a noted legal academic who is a supporter of this tendency. That’s not fearmongering on his part, but hope (hopemongering?) and prediction. So anything that an Administration does to endorse international speech-restrictive norms might well have an effect on our own constitutional rights as well.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. The new anti-stereotyping resolution that was adopted this March by consensus, which Mchangama references, was an improvement over the 2009 one because it does not call for state enforcement of restrictions against speech (though it does say stereotyping should not be used regarding law enforcement or security).\n\n8. It is important to keep in mind that none of these resolutions are binding. And a one-off resolution like the 2009 one poses little threat. The danger is that through annual repetition in a variety of U.N. forums — such as the infamous Durban conferences, as well as the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly — some U.S. court could find a hate-speech ban valid. Or the president could follow the route outlined above by Professor Volokh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. The OIC suffered a substantive (i.e. not merely tactical) loss in its 13-year campaign for a Human Rights Council anti-defamation resolution. It could no longer sell to the rest of the world its inverted idea of human rights — that human rights protect institutions such as Islam, rather than individuals. Some OIC members of course will continue killing and punishing blasphemers at home regardless. And Europe will continue to wiggle between political correctness and free speech.\n\n10. Article 20 has indeed gained in prominence in recent years, demonstrating that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is a very weak reed. There are also exceptions to Article 19 on free speech, including curbs on speech for national security, on public order grounds and to preserve morals, and those are being given more emphasis too in Europe and at the U.N. — the exception is fast becoming the rule. For example, the British have begun to prosecute religious-hate-speech cases involving negative speech against Islam under “public order” laws.\n\nThe bottom line is that the OIC is making hate-speech laws the new battleground for stopping criticism of Islam. The question is: Will the U.S. roll back the First Amendment to conform?\n\n— Nina Shea is director of the Hudson Institute’s Center for Religious Freedom and co-author, with Paul Marshall, of the forthcoming Silenced: How Apostasy and Blasphemy Codes are Choking Freedoms Worldwide.",

These are the aims of a political actor.\n\nA very large political actor is, in fact, involved in the \"Media against Hate\" campaign. The campaign is one of several media programs supported by the EU under its Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme (REC). In the REC program for 2017, the EU Commission, the EU's executive body, writes:\n\n\"DG Justice and Consumers [the EU Commission's justice department] will address the worrying increase of hate crime and hate speech by allocating funding to actions aiming at preventing and combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance... including dedicated work in the area of countering online hate speech (implementation of the Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online)... DG Justice also funds civil society organisations combatting racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance\".\n\nThis political player, the EU, the biggest in Europe, works openly at influencing the \"free press\" with its own political agendas. One of these agendas is the issue of migration into Europe from Africa and the Middle East. In his September State of the Union address, the president of the EU Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, made it clear that whatever Europeans may think -- polls repeatedly show that the majority of Europeans do not want any more migrants -- the EU has no intention of putting a stop to migration. \"Europe,\" Juncker said, \"contrary to what some say, is not a fortress and must never become one. Europe is and must remain the continent of solidarity where those fleeing persecution can find refuge\".\n\nThe EU, the biggest political player Europe, works openly at influencing the \"free press\" with its own political agendas.

(Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)\n\nThe European Union's REC Program also recently financed the publication of a handbook with guidelines for journalists on how to write about migrants and migration. The guidelines form part of the RESPECT WORDS project -- also EU-financed -- which \"aims to promote quality reporting on migrants and ethnic and religious minorities as an indispensable tool in the fight against hate\". The new guidelines are \"aimed at strengthening quality media coverage of migrants and ethnic and religious minorities\". The handbook was launched on October 12 by the International Press Institute (IPI) -- an association of media professionals\" representing leading digital, print and broadcast news outlets in more than 120 countries. IPI boasts that it has been \"defending press freedom since 1950\". (Being bought and paid for by the EU apparently counts as \"press freedom\" these days.) Seven other European media outlets and civil society groups based in Europe participated in the project and presented it at an event at the European Parliament in Brussels attended by MEPs and civil society experts. According to the press release, the guidelines are \"supplementary to standards already in place at news outlets\".\n\nThe guidelines state that, \"journalism cannot and should not 'solve' the problem of hate speech on its own\" but that it can help to prevent its \"normalisation\". However, \"meeting this challenge requires the involvement of many actors, in particular the European Union, which must reinforce existing mechanisms and support new tools designed to combat hate speech...\"\n\nWhy do journalists, who claim to fight for the freedom of the press, now appeal to the EU to help bring an end to freedom of speech in Europe?\n\nAccording to the guidelines, journalists should, among other things:\n\n\"Provide an appropriate range of opinions, including those belonging to migrants and members of minorities, but... not... extremist perspectives just to 'show the other side'... Avoid directly reproducing hate speech; when it is newsworthy to do so, mediate it by...challenging such speech, and exposing any false premises it relies on. Remember that sensitive information (eg race and ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, party affiliation or union affiliation, health and sexual information) should only be mentioned when it is necessary for the public's understanding of the news\".\n\nIs that why news reports always refer to perpetrators of rape or terrorism simply as \"men\"?\n\nSpecifically, with regard to Muslims, the guidelines recommend:\n\n\"Challenge existing anti-Muslim stereotypes that have become pervasive in public discourse... Increase the visibility of Muslim men and women in your general reporting... Take care not to further stigmatise terms such as 'Muslim' or 'Islam' by associating them with particular acts... Don't allow extremists' claims about acting 'in the name of Islam' to stand unchallenged. Highlight... the diversity of Muslim communities... where it is necessary and newsworthy to report hateful comments against Muslims, mediate the information. Challenge any false premises on which such comments rely\".\n\nNot even Orwell could have made that up.\n\nJudith Bergman is a columnist, lawyer and political analyst.\n\n[1] Notably, the Media against Hate campaign does not define what it means by \"hate speech\". The closest one gets to a definition of what the campaign means by the term, comes from a chapter on hate speech from the report, \"Ethics in the News\" by the European Journalism Network (EJN) -- a British organization that claims to be \"an independent, international, non-profit institute dedicated to the highest standards in journalism -- that the 'Media against Hate' has reproduced on its website. EJN defined hate speech as \"...any expression that vilifies an identifiable group — a race, religious community, or sexual minority, for example — and thus prompts harm to members', e.g. \"incitement to... negative discrimination and violence\" and \"expressions that hurt a community's feeling, including by insulting beliefs\". While incitement to violence is punishable by law, hurting a community's feelings is not, but according to EJN, \"legal limits should not determine the boundaries of professional conduct... journalists need to develop their ethical capacities to respond to the real risk of serious harm being promoted\".",

        "text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Western opposition has made it impossible for Muslim states to obtain a ban on blasphemy, including anti-Islamic videos and cartoons that have touched off deadly riots, the Islamic world’s top diplomat said.\n\nEkmeleddin Ihsanoglu, secretary general of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), said his 57-nation body would not try again for United Nations support to ban insults to religion, but appealed for states to apply hate-speech laws concerning Islam.\n\n“We could not convince them,” said the Turkish head of the 57-member organisation which had tried from 1998 until 2011 to get a United Nations-backed ban on blasphemy.\n\n“The European countries don’t vote with us, the United States doesn’t vote with us.”\n\nWestern countries see the publication of such images and materials as a matter of free speech.\n\nThe posting of an amateurish U.S.-made video portraying the Prophet Mohammad as a foolish womanizer and the publication of caricatures of him in France last month led to violent protests and renewed calls from the Muslim world for a global law against blasphemy.\n\nThe protests claimed some two dozen lives.\n\nIhsanoglu told a conference in Istanbul at the weekend that the OIC had failed to win a ban at the United Nations and would not revive its long diplomatic campaign for one.\n\nAsked about recent media reports that the OIC wanted to resume the campaign for a blasphemy ban, he said: “I never said this and I know this will never happen.”\n\nThe OIC respects freedom of expression but sees anti-Islam videos and cartoons as an abuse of this freedom that Western countries should sanction through their own blasphemy or hate crime laws, he said.\n\nLONG DIPLOMATIC STRUGGLE\n\nIhsanoglu’s statement clarified the OIC stand at a time when Muslim religious leaders have stepped up demands for an international blasphemy law and politicians have accused Western states of spreading anti-Muslim hatred under the protection of their free-speech laws.\n\nStarting in 1998, the 57-nation OIC won majorities in U.N. rights bodies and at the U.N. General Assembly every year for non-binding resolutions on “combating defamation of religions” that Western states opposed as potential threats to free speech.\n\nBut support for these texts steadily fell to just over 50 percent by 2010, because of strong Western and growing Latin American opposition, and the OIC opted for a weaker resolution against intolerance towards all religions last year.\n\nThat more general resolution, drawn up with the United States and the European Union, passed unanimously.\n\nThe long dispute highlighted differing views of free speech in Western and Muslim countries. Ihsanoglu said Western states had a “strange understanding” of free speech if it could be abused to hurt and insult others.\n\nResponding at the United Nations last month to the Muslim protests against the U.S.-made video “Innocence of Muslims” parodying Prophet Mohammad, President Barack Obama condemned the film but staunchly defended free speech.\n\n“The strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression, it is more speech - the voices of tolerance that rally against bigotry and blasphemy,” he said.\n\nExplaining his decision not to pursue a world ban, Ihsanoglu said the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and a non-binding 2011 U.N. General Assembly resolution against religious intolerance provided a sufficient basis for U.N. member states to take legal action.\n\n“We have enough law and we need to implement these laws,” he said.\n\nPAKISTAN’S NEGATIVE EXAMPLE\n\nMuslim politicians have stepped up their denunciations of Western free speech policies following the video and cartoons lampooning Prophet Mohammad. Muslims consider any criticism of him as highly offensive and beyond free speech protection.\n\n“We cannot accept insults to Islam under the guise of freedom of thought,” Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan told the Istanbul conference.\n\n“We Muslims want the same respect shown to Jewish culture, which we support,” Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said.\n\nBut while editorialists and religious leaders have renewed calls for a worldwide blasphemy ban, few national leaders have actually ended their rhetorical reactions with that demand.\n\nOne who did at the United Nations last month was President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan, whose own national blasphemy law has come under increasing criticism at home and abroad as open to widespread abuse against minority Christians.\n\nIhsanoglu, speaking at the conference on a panel with Pakistani opposition leader Imran Khan, encouraged countries with blasphemy laws to apply against insults to Islam, and then quickly added: “not particularly the one in Pakistan”.",

        "text": "The \"quite formidable\" Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) \"has really escaped the notice of a lot of foreign policy observers,\" religious freedom scholar Nina Shea noted at a January 17, 2014, Hudson Institute panel. To correct this deficiency, Shea moderated an important presentation on the OIC's stealth jihad against freedom by her \"old friend\" Mark Durie, an Anglican theologian and human rights activist.\n\nAs Durie's PowerPoint presentation available online noted, the 1969-founded OIC headquartered in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, contains 57 mostly Muslim-majority states (including \"Palestine\"). The second largest international organization after the United Nations (UN), the OIC is a \"major global voting block\" at the UN and unique in being the \"only such organization devoted to advancing a religion.\" The OIC is \"largely funded by Saudi Arabia,\" Shea noted, having contributed $30 million to the 2008 budget, far greater than the next largest contribution of $3 million from Kuwait.\n\nOminously, the OIC has been \"lobbying assiduously\" since about 2000 against \"Islamophobia,\" Shea observed. \"Islamophobia\" was analogous to \"homophobia,\" Durie's PowerPoint elaborated, an analogy previously noted by Islamic sharia law expert Stephen Coughlin and analyzed by this author. A \"[n]arrow reading\" of this \"deep-seated and irrational fear about Islam or Muslims\" would encompass only prejudices such as the \"xenophobic aversion to Muslims\" of some.\n\nA \"[b]road reading\" by the OIC and others, though, condemns \"all expressions of opposition to or disapproval of Islam\" as \"irrational and manifestations of prejudice.\" \"Islamophobia is a deliberate scheme to distort the teachings and principles of peace and moderation engrained in Islam,\" the PowerPoint quoted from the OIC's 2013 Sixth OIC Observatory Report on Islamophobia. \"9/11 came as a long awaited opportunity,\" the report specifies, \"for the anti-Islam and anti-Muslim elements in the West to set in motion their well orchestrated plan to slander Islam and target Muslims by equating terror with Islam and Muslims.\" Such bigots were \"just hanging out\" and waiting for Al Qaeda's September 11, 2001, attacks, Durie mocked.\n\nThe OIC and its recently retired Secretary-General Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu assume that the \"Islamic religion is under attack,\" thereby posing an \"atmosphere of threat to the world,\" Durie stated. Yet American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) hate crime statistics in Durie's PowerPoint belie this Islamic victimhood, with attacks upon Jews far outstripping those on Muslims in 2012 (674 to 130). Western states in the past have also often aided their Muslim minorities and Muslim countries, such as when the British government donated land for the United Kingdom's first mosque, London Central Mosque.\n\nThe \"Islamophobia\" campaign, moreover, manifests the distorted subordination of human rights to Islamic sharia law present throughout the OIC's 1990 Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam. Therein rights such as free speech may not contradict the Koranic phrase \"what is good\" according to Islam. Similar distorted sectarianism is evident in the juxtaposition of OIC documents on \"Combating Islamophobia\" internationally and OIC-supported UN resolutions such as 16/18 in the Human Rights Council advocating religious equality.\n\nThe OIC and others are having results, for example with \"Islamophobia\" described by Durie as a \"new field of studies\" at various universities. The British Runnymede Trust also released a 1997 report condemning as \"Closed views\" beliefs listed in the PowerPoint such as \"Islam is inferior,\" \"violent,\" or a \"political ideology.\" Shea also speculated about the \"creative arrest\" of Innocents of Muslims filmmaker Nakoula Basseley Nakoula for a parole violation, something usually not resulting in a jail sentence, as a de facto blasphemy punishment.\n\nDurie's PowerPoint examined several problems in OIC \"Islamophobia\" arguments. Ironically, \"beliefs which the OIC Observatory Report identifies as examples of Islamophobia accord with the teachings of leading Muslim experts on Islam, including the OIC's own scholars.\" Jihad as religious warfare, wife-beating, and an emphasis on separation of Muslims from non-Muslims all fall into this category.\n\nParticularly troubling was the OIC's \"Lack of Reciprocity & Consistency.\" While the OIC \"solely targeted…the West,\" the \"most egregious violations of Muslims' religious freedom\" occur at the hands of other Muslims. Additionally, \"Islamic states consistently generate many examples of incitement on the grounds of religion.\" Christianity in particular is the \"most persecuted religion today\" according to various estimates, with many OIC states being the worst offenders. The PowerPoint questioned whether OIC \"Islamophobia\" reports themselves amounted to incitement, given that individuals listed therein like Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks often became assassination targets.\n\nFurthermore, the \"OIC positively stereotypes Islam and Muslims, and negatively stereotypes all manifestations of rejection of Islam by non-Muslims.\" The \"OIC insists that no acts of violence…can have a genuine Islamic motivation.\" Yet \"all forms of opposition to Islam must be viewed as manifestations of prejudice and hatred…this is itself a manifestation of religious prejudice.\"\n\nIn all, the OIC's \"Islamophobia\" campaign was \"constructing a global infrastructure for da'wa,\" or proselytization. An \"approved set of positive beliefs about Islam\" spread \"under the guise of preventing racism.\" That itself entails \"bias, prejudice and a rejection of any kind of genuine reciprocity between faiths.\"\n\nAs part of this effort, \"religious dialogue is an important venue for promoting Islamic values,\" Durie noted during the question period. Yet \"we \"can't just deal with Islamophobia in a vacuum\" absent discussion of persecuted Christians, Durie warned. Churches should focus on this more, irrespective of fears of harming outreach to Muslims.\n\nResponding to questions, Durie also discussed a \"disconnect\" between OIC goals and the UN framework of human rights, something \"on the Muslim side they are well aware of.\" Thus Durie was \"quite cynical about the whole exercise.\" Shea recalled the Cold War joke about the Soviets saying, \"We have the right to criticize your president too.\"\n\nAn audience questioner also noticed a \"disconnect\" between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the OIC during her engagement on \"Islamophobia\" with the organization. Durie noted that Clinton \"tried to challenge\" the OIC for more religious tolerance. Shea also described Clinton as trying to find \"elusive common ground\" with the OIC.\n\nYet she and her husband William Clinton suffered from a \"broader religious illiteracy.\" Downplaying religion as a factor in human behavior, such as when the former president attributed Boko Haram's jihad ravages to material deprivation, the Clintons believe that \"there is nothing to investigate\" in Islam. Instead, Durie described Hillary Clinton's expressed definition of extremists as \"people who believe that their beliefs are correct,\" thereby equating Osama bin Laden with Mother Theresa. This \"damaged worldview\" entails \"flying blind\" with the OIC. In contrast, those who wish to see would do well to heed Durie's presentation, insightful for even longtime OIC watchers.",
