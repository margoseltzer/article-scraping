Chuck Grassley has an 11-point advantage over former Lt. Gov. Patty Judge, 55 percent to 43 percent. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet leads El Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn by 9 points, 52 percent to 43 percent. And Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson tops his opponent, Jim Barksdale, 55 percent to 34 percent.\nThe polling results mirror the current presidential standing. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton holds a narrow advantage over Donald Trump in Colorado, where Bennet, a Democrat, also leads. Trump, however, has 6- and 7-point leads over Clinton in Iowa and Georgia, respectively.\nThe surveys were conducted Sept. 13-21. The Iowa poll of 612 likely voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, while the Colorado and Georgia surveys of 644 and 638 likely voters, respectively, both have a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points.\nThis article tagged under:\n",
