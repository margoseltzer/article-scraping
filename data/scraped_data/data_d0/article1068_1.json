And that was — believe me, I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it — but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.\"\nStoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, defended NATO's track record of fighting terrorism.\n“We went into Afghanistan to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe heaven for international terrorists,” he said, stressing that it was “our biggest military operation ever.” NATO “has and is playing a key role in the fight against terrorism” and the organization has “stepped up our efforts to support the U.S.-led coalition to fight ISIL.”\nStoltenberg also said that NATO's newly created position of assistant to the secretary-general for intelligence “will also be a tool in our efforts to fight terrorism, to share intelligence.” But he insisted the role is “something which has been planned and discussed for a long time and is not a result of the U.S. election campaign.”\nThe Trump administration said six months ago it intended to scrap the 1987 agreement, citing repeated Russian violations.\nLog-in\nPassword\nRemember me\nLog in\n",
