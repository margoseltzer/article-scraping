Screams are heard as passengers are thrown to the ground.\nOfficials said the man who was killed was one of several people who were thrown to the ground when the ride malfunctioned. They have not released his name. Ohio State Medical Center said three of the injured were being treated there. Two of them were in critical condition, the hospital said Thursday.\n* indicates required\nEmail Address *\nRecent Posts\nDaily Buzz Live Search\n",
