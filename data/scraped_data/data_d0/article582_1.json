However, determining the reasons for the elevator issues has taken longer than expected, National Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst told CNN on Monday.\n\"Basically, we've had to make the difficult decision to keep the monument closed until the modernization work on the elevator is completed,\" Litterst said, characterizing the move as a \"long-term\" closure.\nRead More\nLitterst said that although National Park Service officials previously considered the theory that a 2011 earthquake could have contributed to the elevator problems, a third-party inspector didn't \"see any evidence\" that the earthquake is a factor.\nA block-by-block inspection of the monument began in August 2011 , after the structure experienced ground motion from the 2011 earthquake that struck the neighboring state of Virginia.\n",
