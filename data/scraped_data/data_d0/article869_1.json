Godkin Lecture and discuss “the lack of economic and social mobility in the United States and his ideas for addressing those challenges,” according to a press release announcing the appointment Tuesday.\nThe son and brother of former presidents, Bush entered the Republican primary as a favorite of the party establishment’s donor base and an expected front-runner. He failed to gain traction, though, as voters gravitated toward other candidates — including the party’s eventual nominee, Donald Trump — and Bush dropped out of the race in February after a poor showing in the South Carolina primary.\nPolitico Magazine\nBy Austin Sarat and Jonathan Obert\n",
