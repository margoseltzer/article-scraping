        "text": "Kids & Fitness....Get the Kids Off the Couch & Have Some Fun!\nMonday, September 25, 2017 8:35\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nWe live in a time when there are too many things kids can do to entertain themselves while remaining inactive: television and movies, smart phones, video games and social media and of course what my kid loves to do…sleep!\nSo how can you get your kids to jump off the couch, put down whatever electronic device they’re holding, and join you for a bit of good old fashioned exercise?\nThe Right Approach\nEncourage your kids to exercise! Experience tell us the best way to get your kids to exercise is to set a positive example. So you have to get the party started…grab your FlexFit Mat, lay it out in the living room floor, and invite your kids to join you. Whether or not they do so (they probably won’t at first), make sure you run through some exercises of your own.\nYoung children love to spend time with their parents, and the more they see you exercising without them, the more they will want to come and join you. For older kids, you might have to work better Jedi mind tricks on them and make it challenging. Competition works great: see who can do the most sit-ups, push-ups, or plank the longest (hint: let them win a few times). Keep a chart in the kitchen with daily results and create an end-of-summer reward.\nMake it Fun!\nWhen your kids finally do join you, be sure to make your workout as fun as possible! You could get ambitious like this dad who created a American Ninja Warrior obstacle course for his daughter in the backyard!\nFor the parents that don’t have the time or resources to make their own mini Mount Midoriyama at home, try setting up a series of exercises that tell a story, or turn on some music and invent a new dance, or create your own iron-kid contest. Use your imagination! After a while, you might be surprised to see how much your kids look forward to working out with you.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
