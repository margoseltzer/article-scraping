This is the reality for workers who maintain the antennas on some of the tallest buildings in the world.\nSome jobs can be dangerous, so workers will receive hazard pay on top of their hourly rate. But I can only wonder how much THIS guy gets paid for his job.\nThis video, entitled ‘Stairway to Heaven’, shows a climbers view going up a 1768 foot gided tower. It all starts with an elevator ride to about 1600 ft., then the climbing begins.\nNot only do they have to climb, but they have to carry a 30 pound tool bag with them as well.It’s kind of like a spacewalk, where you have to remember everything you need to bring, because it’s a long way down. At times, these workers free climb, which means no safety lines are used.\nThis video had me on the edge of my seat! Check it out.\n* indicates required\nEmail Address *\nRecent Posts\nYemeni Child Bride Dies At Age 8 From Internal Injuries.  An 8 year old child READ MORE →\nDaily Buzz Live Search\n",
