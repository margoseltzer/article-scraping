Diabetes develops when your body doesn’t respond well to insulin, which is a hormone made in your pancreas. Insulin is responsible for helping your body properly use sugar (glucose) from your food—your body typically uses glucose for energy, but when you have diabetes, this process doesn’t work. To treat the condition, you’ve got to take steps to get things functioning well again. There are many ways to do this—first, you’ll need to make some lifestyle changes, and then your doctor will likely prescribe medications, before finally turning to insulin injections. Everyone’s path is different, and it might take a few tries to find the right treatment for you, but keep in mind that your doctor will be with you every step of the way.\nAdvances in diabetes treatment have recently brought us non-insulin injectable medications, which can be a great option to help you control your diabetes and stay healthy.\nTranscript\nopen\nDr. Goddard:        Many of the more recent developments in diabetes treatment have been allowing the body to utilize insulin better.    Dr. Goddard:        Type 2 diabetes is really a disease of too much insulin, insulin resistance, and the body's inability to use insulin.   Dr. Goddard:        There are some medications on the market now that are non-insulin injectable medications. Most of them fall into a group of medications called GLP-1s. GLP-1 is a hormone that our bodies make; people without diabetes have GLP-1 as well. And GLP-1 prevents the breakdown of insulin.   Dr. Eytan:          This is a really nice class of medications that basically makes your insulin work better and also slows down your gastric emptying, slows down your food digestion.   Jennifer:           GLP-1s are already naturally in your body, so it just gives you more.   Dr. Goddard:        By giving you more GLP-1 through an injection, you can actually increase a patient's insulin sensitivity, and if they take injectable insulin, you can often decrease the doses that they need to maintain a normal blood sugar.    Dr. Eytan:          Those are available once a day, once a week, we have a few options out there now.   Jennifer:           People do lose weight with the GLP-1s, so usually that makes them really like it.   Dr. Goddard:        In most cases, patients with type 2 diabetes need to lose weight and so this can actually be helpful.   Jennifer:           You will feel more full and you will have better control over your sugars. Usually if someone is already taking insulin and already used to the injections, they also don't mind as much taking the once-daily injection. If someone is new to shots, it's less scary giving the weekly injections.   Dr. Eytan:          It's a really common fear to be afraid of needles and to delay using a GLP-1 agonist or insulin, because of that fear of needles. However, I always find that patients imagine the needle to be much worse than it is.   Jennifer:           The needle sizes are so small that once you do it the first time, then it actually gets easier, because you realize that it doesn't hurt at all.\nLifestyle Changes\nNot everyone diagnosed with diabetes needs medication at first. It might be that you just need to make healthy lifestyle changes. Your doctor will likely connect you with a certified diabetes educator, who can work with you to make these changes and get control of your diabetes. This may mean an overhaul of your typical diet, making sure you get plenty of high-fiber, low-fat foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. You’ll also want to eat fewer refined carbohydrates (like white bread and rice), less meat, and fewer sweets. You’ll start on a fitness routine to get your body more active and promote weight loss, and you’ll also want to try some stress relief techniques, like yoga or meditation, to keep blood pressure down and promote good overall health.\nOral Medications\nHowever, often lifestyle changes aren’t enough to help you gain control of your diabetes, so your doctor will turn to oral medications. These pills work in different ways to get your blood sugar levels balanced. Keep in mind, though, that the combination of oral medications and lifestyle changes is the most effective way to manage your diabetes—just because you’re prescribed medication doesn’t mean you should quit going to the gym or stop watching what you eat.\nThere are several different types of oral diabetes medications your doctor can prescribe. The most common medication is called metformin, and it works by limiting how much sugar your liver releases into your bloodstream. Other types of diabetes pills stimulate your pancreas to release more insulin, so it can regulate your blood sugar levels. And there are some drugs that manage your blood sugar levels by both limiting the amount of glucose your body makes and stimulating insulin production.\nSometimes, diabetes pills stop working after a period of time—they may stop being effective after just a few months or a few years. Often, we’re not sure exactly why they don’t work anymore, but it doesn’t mean your diabetes has gotten worse. In the past, when this happened, doctors would put patients on insulin right away. However, today we have many more options to try before insulin. In these cases, your doctor may prescribe you more than one oral medication to take; this is called combination therapy. There are even medications available that combine two oral drugs in one pill, so you’re not taking lots of pills every day. Many people take two or three kinds of oral diabetes pills to manage their condition, and some even take pills and insulin together, or pills and non-insulin injections together. It all depends on your specific case, and your doctor will work to find the right fit for you.\nNon-Insulin Injectable Medications\nIn recent years, a new type of diabetes drug has come onto the market—the non-insulin injectable. If oral drugs aren’t helping you stay in control of your diabetes, your doctor might prescribe you a non-insulin injectable medication. They work by increasing the amount of insulin your body makes and decreasing the amount of sugar your body sends into your bloodstream. If you have a hard time remembering to take your pills several times a day, non-insulin injectables can be a good option; it depends on the specific medication, but some are injected once a week, once a day, or twice a day.\nWas this helpful?
