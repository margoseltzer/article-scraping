        "text": "Insiders clash over politics of terrorism\n'We have an older electorate, plus still some conservative white Democrats. In a close race, fear can win out,' said a Florida Democrat.\nThe POLITICO Caucus debates whether the rising salience of terrorism and police shootings will benefit Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.  | POLITICO Illustration / Getty\nDemocrats are confident the rising salience of terrorism and police shootings of African-Americans this week will benefit Hillary Clinton. Republicans, meanwhile, believe overwhelmingly that Donald Trump will win the terrorism argument but are less confident that he'll react in a measured way to the recent protests in North Carolina.\nThat’s according to The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. More than three-in-four Democratic insiders believe Clinton will benefit from the increasing prominence of both issues. And while majorities of Republicans, on the other hand, think both issues will help Trump, there’s less confidence that he can strike the right balance between law enforcement and the aggrieved African-American community.\nStory Continued Below\nOn terrorism and national security, the results were fell along party lines: 76 percent of Democrats said Clinton stands to benefit from the issue, compared to 81 percent of Republicans who said it would help Trump. That mirrors public polling that shows voters divided on which candidate they trust more on the issue — with a slight edge for Clinton, particularly on temperament and ability to be commander-in-chief.\n“Polls show that folks do not trust Trump to have his finger on the button,” said one Wisconsin Democrat — who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. “That to me says it all.”\nA Pennsylvania Democrat added that Trump’s criticism of military leadership for their prosecution of the overseas battle against the Islamic State has alienated key voters in their state.\n“Trump's open disrespect of the military doesn't play well among the same base he's supposed to be courting — the disaffected Western [Pennsylvania] voters,” the Democrat said.\nBut some Democrats are concerned that rising anxieties about terrorism — if they were to persist for the next six-and-a-half weeks — could benefit Trump.\n“We have an older electorate, plus still some conservative white Democrats,” said a Florida Democrat. “In a close race, fear can win out.”\nRepublicans, meanwhile, said Trump can effectively tie Clinton to President Barack Obama — who, despite rising approval ratings overall, rates poorly on his handling of national security.\n“People who are angry and afraid feel that way because of the Obama-Clinton policies that created [ISIL] and allowed the wave of domestic terror to occur largely unchecked,” said an Ohio Republican.\n“She's counting on ‘experience’ and ‘being there in the situation room,’” said a Michigan Republican. “I think that works against her and solidifies that she's part of the problem.”\nOn the other burgeoning issue this week — the police-involved shootings in Tulsa, Okla., and Charlotte, N.C. — majorities of Democrats again defaulted to their partisan leanings. But Republicans were less certain the issue would help Trump — only 61 percent said it would — compared to the larger majority that said it would benefit Clinton, 77 percent.\n(Reponses were filed between 5 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, prior to the beginning of a second night of rioting in Charlotte, and 2 p.m. Thursday.)\nDemocrats mostly said the issue allowed Clinton to strengthen her appeal to minority voters — and, potentially, for Trump to repel nonwhite voters further.\n“The voters who are young, who are people of color, and who are most sympathetic to the injustice of police shootings are more liberal, but inconsistent voters,” said a Michigan Democrat. “This increased attention, if it has any impact, will boost their participation, and they are more likely to vote for Clinton.”\nAdded a Florida Democrat: “If Clinton can get black turnout as a share of electorate to Obama levels, in addition to her Hispanic advantages, she can lose a bit of white support and win.”\nBut some Democrats worried about a backlash among white voters to the at-times-violent protests.\n“Pictures of black youth burning things in the middle of Interstate 85 in Charlotte last night did nothing but help Trump,” said a North Carolina Democrat. “With more demonstrations planned for tonight, this issue could even surpass the HB2 fiasco as the defining issue in the campaign for North Carolina voters.”\nMost Republicans see the issue as an opportunity for Trump to burnish his law-and-order credentials.\n“People believe Obama has created an anti-police attitude in this country, and many will punish Hillary Clinton for that,” a Florida Republican said.\nAnd the demographic reality of the battleground states — many of them, like Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire have smaller African-American populations — means a backlash among white voters in those states could tilt toward Trump.\nA Colorado Democrat said the African-American vote there was “small and already locked in.”\n“Iowa is 93 percent white, and [Black Lives Matter] protests are more galvanizing for downscale white voters than urban liberals,” said a Republican there. “And those rural white voters outnumber urban liberals by a lot, many of them former working class Democrats who are attracted to nationalist, anti-PC rhetoric.”\n“There are way more ‘Blue Lives’ than ‘Black Lives’ Matter folks in Iowa,” added another Republican there. “Trump will clean up.”\nBut some Republicans in more diverse states said the issue could motivate some members of the Obama coalition who haven’t been enthusiastic about Clinton.\n“[T]o the extent it may generate increased interest in public policy and the election in her base, that would be a good thing for her,” said a Virginia Republican. “Hillary's base is there, but they aren't motivated or excited.”\nAdded an Ohio Republican: “Hillary has to ignite the black community. I expect the Obamas to camp out in the cities. This unrest could become a focal point for her.”\nAnd for other Republicans, they questioned Trump's ability to address these issues in a measured way.\n\"Trump is antagonistic and demeaning, and his ideology on racial issues/police shootings is embarrassing,\" said a Colorado Republican.\nA New Hampshire Republican put it even more sharply: \"No matter how hard he tries, Trump is incapable of hiding his racism.\"\nBut with the demographic push-and-pull between groups concerned in equal measure about the police shootings and the subsequent protests, others saw the issue as a wash between the two candidates.\n“I think it helps them both equally,” said a Michigan Republican. “Hillary needs minority turnout to go up, and this certainly helps there. Trump needs disaffected, law-and-order, white voters to turn out — this helps him with that.”\nThese are the members of The POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated in this special survey:\nColorado: Ryan Call, Laura Carno, Matt Chandler, Will Coyne, Adam Eichberg, Mark Ferrandino, Cole Finegan, Michael Fortney, Andrew Freedman, Ted Harvey, Craig Hughes, Owen Loftus, Pete Maysmith, Frank McNulty, Karen Middleton, Christopher Murray, BJ Nikkel, Josh Penry, Rick Ridder, Alan Salazar, Janice Sinden, Pat Steadman, Pat Waak, Steve Welchert, Taylor West, Roxane White, Rob Witwer\nFlorida: Fernand Amandi, Scott Arceneaux, JP Austin, Tim Baker, Dennis K.
