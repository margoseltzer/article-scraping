We will all be arrested for this movie,’” the president said in his introductory remarks.\n“Now to be fair, Mel also said, a little more eloquently, that every human being has hundreds of separate people living inside his skin and the talent of a writer is his ability to give them their separate names, identities, personalities and have them relate to other characters living within him,” Obama continued. “And that I think, is [what] the arts and humanities do: They lift up our identities and make us see ourselves in each other.”\nPolitico Magazine\nBy Austin Sarat and Jonathan Obert\n",
