Add your two cents.\nWe are just a few days away until the National League Division Series between the Chicago Cubs and Washington Nationals begins in D.C. in what should be a great series. As we get ready, the Cubs have officially announced their rotation for the first four games of the series. After meeting on Wednesday, the Cubs have announced that Kyle Hendricks will get the start in Game 1. CSN Chicago’s Patrick Mooney revealed the rotation which goes Hendricks, Jon Lester, Jose Quintana and Jake Arrieta: https://twitter.com/markgrotesports/status/915623748543401984 The biggest question mark for the Cubs rotation going into the series was Arrieta’s health. He’s been dealing with a hamstring injury that has bothered him the final few weeks of the season. But now we have our answer as he will take the mound in a critical Game 4, if there is no sweep for either team. The Nationals have yet to announce their rotation but it’s expected that Max Scherzer will go in Game 3.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
