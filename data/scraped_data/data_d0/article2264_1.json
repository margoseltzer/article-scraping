It topped the UK box office, with sales above £6m.\nThe sequel to the 1982 cult classic, which also stars Harrison Ford as well as Ryan Gosling, cost Sony and Alcon Entertainment $150m to make.\nDespite strong advance ticket sales and glowing reviews from many critics, the movie made $12.7m on Thursday night and Friday, $11.4m on Saturday and a projected $7.4m on Sunday from just over 4,000 cinemas.\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\nMedia captionRyan Gosling and Harrison Ford star in the sequel of Blade Runner\nPaul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with comScore, said: \"The core of enthusiastic and loyal 'Blade Runner' fans were over 25 and predominantly male, and propelled the film as expected to the top spot, but a lengthy running time and lesser interest among females made it tougher for the film to reach the original weekend box office projections.\"\nMen over 25 accounted for half the audience, according to PostTrack, with women over 25 making up 27%.\nJeff Goldstein, of Warner Bros, said  Blade Runner 2049 had disappointed in smaller cities and in the South and Midwest, where the running time and baseball playoffs appeared to have deterred moviegoers.\n\"We did well in the major and high-profile markets,\" he said. \"Alcon and Denis [Villeneuve, the director] made an amazing movie. The audience for it was narrower than we anticipated.\"\nImage copyright Getty Images\nImage caption Harrison Ford at the film's Madrid premiere\nGlobally, the film took $50.2m and claimed the number one spot in 45 of its 63 markets, Screen Daily reported .\nThat tally was higher than the $44.6m for The Martian, starring Matt Damon, on its opening weekend in 2015. The movie was directed by Ridley Scott, who also made the original Blade Runner and was an executive producer on 2049.\nThe Chinese comedy Never Say Die took $66m globally to top the international box office, pushing Kingsman: The Golden Circle into second place.\nThe remake of the Stephen King killer clown thriller It has now taken $305m in the US, and almost as much internationally, to top the $600m mark globally, making it the most successful horror film.\nUK moviegoers have been its biggest fans, spending $40.7m (£31.1m) on tickets since its release on 8 September.\n",
