        "text": "Trump defends telling black voters 'what do you have to lose?'\nBy NICK GASS\nFor Donald Trump, his repeated questioning of the African-American community about what little they had to lose by supporting his candidacy has \"resonated because it is true,\" the Republican nominee declared Wednesday.\nAddressing a gathering of pastors in Cleveland, Trump discussed his strategy to fix crime and other issues in the \"inner cities.\"\nStory Continued Below\n\"And I talked about jobs. The jobs are just so bad. And I said it three or four five times. Then one day I said, what do you have to lose? I mean what do you have to lose? I'm going to fix it. What do you have to lose?\" Trump said. \"And somehow that resonated.\"\n\"Some people didn't like it. But I said, what difference does it make? I mean, it's true,\" he said, to laughter. \"What do you have to lose? And, it resonated and it has been amazing how it has resonated because it is true.\"\n",
