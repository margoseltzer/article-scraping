        "text": "By\n3910\nSHARES\nWho’s McMullin?\nEvan McMullin was a Republican. At the beginning of August, he announced his Independent candidacy for president as an alternative to Republican nominee Donald Trump.\nRina Shah is a political and media consultant who joined McMullin’s campaign staff as Communications Director in mid-August 2016. Shah was born in West Virginia to Indian American parents.  She has been a commentator on the PBS program “To the Contrary” and she founded Rilax Strategies, a political consulting firm.\nShah said to BuzzFeed that this wasn’t the first time she’s received such messages:\n“I could send you, I’m not kidding, hundreds of emails I’ve received … You know, ‘You’re a Muslim,’ ‘You’re a C-U-N-T’ — I get a lot of, ‘Go back to your country.’”\nThe Messenger And His Message\nThe caller identified himself only as “Alan.” BuzzFeed tracked him down and learned that his name is Alan Pryce. Once the transcript of the message was read to him, Pryce claimed it and said he:\n“…Stands by every word.”\nMr. Pryce seems to have the same loose relationship with the truth as the candidate he supports. He did not know, for example, that Ms. Shah was born in the United States. His reaction:\n“Really? Well, she’s absolutely a first-gen whatever. Look, I didn’t do a biography on her.”\nHe continued:\n“Clearly, she’s an anti-American supporter of a pathological, lying criminal. Anyone who supports [Hillary Clinton], either actively or tacitly, is anti-American scum in my mind.”\nBuzzFeed reported that Pryce says he was disabled by an undocumented immigrant. He would not give any details, so BuzzFeed could not confirm his story.\nPryce had some choice words for McMullin, too (“cuckservative,” which is straight from the alt-right ‘s racist playbook). But he doesn’t mind at all being part of the McMullin campaign’s ad. He thinks it’s “hysterical.”\nWatch  the ad  with Alan’s message, but be warned that it’s language is quite graphic:\nFeatured Image: Screenshot Via YouTube  Video .\n3910\nSHARES\nLeave this field empty if you're human:\nMORE STORIES\n",
