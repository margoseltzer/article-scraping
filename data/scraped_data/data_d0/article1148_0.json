        "text": "Total:\nLas Vegas: Bombshell Video Shows Second Shooter During Vegas Massacre The Alex Jones Channel\nWednesday, October 4, 2017 12:33\n \nWas there a second shooter? Who killed the shooter? If there was a second shooter, why he or she is not arrested? Was this stage? Was Stephen Paddock setup? Was a lonewolf? Can ISIS members do this terrible killings and escape without detection?\nCould Stephen Paddock, the lone Vegas shooter, have been a patsy to kick off the left’s war with the right in the streets of America and to simultaneously roll in the Rapiscan naked body scanners that profit former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, George Soros and a handful of lobbyists connected to the management of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino?\n“The LVMPD knows the motive behind the attack, but the FBI will not allow us to release the motive because it implicates the FBI in illegal arms deals and supplying arms to ISIS terrorists within U.S. borders.”\n“Stephen Paddock was an undercover FBI agent who participated in multiple illegal arms deals in the Las Vegas area in a gun running entrapment scheme similar to Fast and Furious. Paddock thought he was engaging in another routine arms transfer, but ISIS had learned about the entrapment scheme and Paddock’s true identity. They killed him and carried out the massacre, and then fled the scene.”\nSources:\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
