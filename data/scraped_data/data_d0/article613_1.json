When news of the scandal first broke in 1998 , Clinton led the White House's behind-the-scenes damage-control efforts and appeared on several news programs to defend her husband, blaming the allegations on a \"vast right-wing conspiracy\" that she said was part of a political effort to bring down the president.\nGiuliani, however, accused Clinton of \"trying to paint her as an insane young woman.\" He did not offer any proof in his interview and a message left with the Clinton campaign seeking response was not immediately returned.\nGiuliani and Trump have both been married three times and engaged in extramarital relationships that have led to past divorces.\nBut asked about Trump's hint that he could bring up Bill Clinton's infidelity at an upcoming debate, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day\" Tuesday that the former first lady was \"ready for anything.\"\n\"This is -- it's such an obvious dodge. He spiraled out at the end of the debate and so, of course, he wants to bully. He wants to talk about the supposed indiscretions,\" Mook said.\nCNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.\n",
