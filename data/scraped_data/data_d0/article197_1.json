        "text": "·\nPolice say Keith Lamont Scott had a gun. Scott’s family says he was just reading a book.\nBut it doesn’t matter what the facts are, racists are not only happy that another black man is dead, but theyalso want police to kill all of the people protesting the shooting.\nProtests broke out in Charlotte, North Carolina on Tuesday night and, as usual, Fox News went to great lengths to portray the protest as a full scale riot and that sent racists into a hateful frenzy on Twitter.\nFOX NEWS ALERT: At least 12 Charlotte officers injured in latest anti-police protests (via @HuntsmanAbby ) pic.twitter.com/TW0wmvSSNM\nAnd here are some of the worst remarks.\n@foxandfriends @HuntsmanAbby anti police protests is what u call it ? Looked more like drugged out animals robbing stores to me wtf\n@foxandfriends @HuntsmanAbby Can someone explain to me what Walmart had to do with the police shooting in NC. These ppl are THUGS period\nIn addition, Raw Story captured screenshots of some comments that have since been deleted.\nThese are the people who are going to be voting in November for Donald Trump, who has the backing of white supremacist groups.\nWhile some people are wrongly taking advantage of the protests to riot, it’s also wrong to call black people “animals” or “savages” or the N-word. Tensions are already high enough as it is. Adding this kind of racism to the mix won’t help settle things down.\nFeatured image via screen capture\n",
