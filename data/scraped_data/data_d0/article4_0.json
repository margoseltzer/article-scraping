        "text": "·\nIt’s no secret that Bill Maher, comedian extraordinaire and host of HBO’s Real Time, is no fan of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. So, of course he couldn’t resist live tweeting the entire first general election presidential debate between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The whole thing was one brilliant insult against Trump after another. Here are a few of the better tweets:\nGOP won expectations game when it nominated an orangutan. As long as he doesn't fling his poop, \"Surprisingly dignified Trump last night\"\nWant to see Hillary come out and say \"The Russians just handed me your tax returns\" just to see if Trump bolts\nTrump adjusting his Spanx right now, and one final pass with the can of Final Net…\nTrump proud of himself that he called her \"Secretary Clinton\" – as opposed to what, Bitchula?\nTrump. Wearing a tie made in China, just sayin'\nOK,I hope she's playing rope-a-dope, and I do mean dope, because I'm getting tired of this vile nincompoop bullying and lieing and its early\nTrump: \"Being in Iraq was a disaster, but we shld take the oil\"WE WLD HAVE TO BE BACK IN IRAQ TO TAKE THE OIL! They won't give it to a drone\nbtw, you know a charge agst Trump is 100% provably true when he interrupts with \"Wrong!\" #debates\nAnd, of course, for his closers, Maher had to do what he’s been doing on his show ever since it became clear who the nominees would be, and hit those who refuse to vote for Hillary:\nHowever this comes out, I have so little respect for the electorate just that its this close. She's right, she shld be 50 points ahead.\nBut he definitely saved his best line for last, as he called Trump his favorite phrase:\nNegative ads in a political race are \"not nice?\" There's no crying in politics, you #WhinyLittleBitch !\nLet’s face it, no matter how Trump’s surrogates try to spin this — and they are already out in force doing their damndest — he lost this thing tonight, badly. He made an absolute fool of himself. There’s just no way around it. Of course, his uneducated core supporters will still vote for him, but there’s no way this one got the undecided voters into Trump’s corner. The one thing tonight did do, though, is give us plenty of entertainment.\nFeatured image via Sara D. Davis/Getty Images\nSearch\nArchives\nArchives\n",
