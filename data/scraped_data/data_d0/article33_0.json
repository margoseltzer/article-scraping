Final debate polls are in – and the MOVEMENT wins! #AmericaFirst #MAGA #ImWithYou https://t.co/3KWOl2ibaW pic.twitter.com/sfCEE3I5pF\nTuesday morning after the first televised presidential debate, a mysterious #TrumpWon hashtag emerged from the Russian troll-farms in St. Petersberg that started trending along with dubious online polls saying Trump had won the debate.\nThe hashtag ran contrary to the popular opinion reflected in  every major media news network poll, which showed Hilary Clinton as the clear winner of the night. Even conservative TV network Fox News conceded this point when attracting attention to the polls  saying, “if polls only included media pundits, Hillary Clinton would have won Monday’s debate by a landslide.”\nThing is, Hilary did win the debate by a landslide, even if the online polls didn’t accurately reflect that. And thanks to  The Daily Dot , we now know the reason why Trump won the online polls but literally lost by every other yardstick:\nIt’s because Trump supporters cheated.\nSee Also\nThe effort to create a false narrative of a Trump debate victory began by recruiting members of the pro-Trump Reddit community r/The_Donald and 4chan message boards, affecting somewhere around 70 polls, including polls by  Time ,  Fortune , and CNBC. The  r/The_Donald  community has over 200,000 subscribers, and with its numbers it made short work of online polls susceptible to bots, vote brigading, and other forms of manipulation that make these online survey results extremely dubious.\nThis latest instance of foul play from the Trump campaign tells us the length to which Trump supporters will go to get their candidate elected, especially if they see it as their only recourse. Luckily nothing could be done for Donald, because his loss was so dramatically obvious, that tampering with the polls wasn’t enough to hide the glaring fact that he lost.\nLet’s hope that next November, manipulating online polls won’t be enough to stop the critical mass of reasonable voters who don’t want to elect a megalomaniac.\nWhat do you think?\nDon’t let Trump fire Special Prosecutor Mueller\nSpecial Prosecutor Mueller has found enough evidence to bring charge in his investigation of the Trump campaign’s alleged collusion with Russia, but President Trump has openly talked of firing Mueller before he can bring justice. Don’t let him! Demand Congress pass a law preventing Trump from firing Mueller before it’s too late.\nThank you for making your voice heard!\nOD Action will be in touch with periodic updates.
