He loved my mother.\"\nCharles and Sara Rippey were among the 21 people killed by California's raging wildfires, which are still roaring across the state with no end in sight.\nRead More\nIn many areas, the smoke is thick and the sky is orange. And the families of more than 500 people are still searching for their missing loved ones.\nHere's what we know about some of the victims and those still missing:\nThe victims lost\nCharles and Sara Rippey\nThe Rippeys' love affair started early -- Charles was in the sixth grade, and Sara was in the fourth grade, their son Mike said.\nThis undated photo of Charles and Sara Rippey was provided by their son Michael Rippey. The couple's bodies were found Monday.\nAfter Charles went to fight in World War II, he returned and had five children with his beloved, Mike Rippey told KPIX. They recently celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary.\nMike Rippey said he believes his father died trying to save his mother. Charles Rippey's body was found in the charred remains of the hallway just outside where his wife was sleeping.\n\"From where they found his body, he was trying to get from his room to her room,\" he said. \"He never made it. Even if he had gotten there, he wouldn't have been able to get her out. ... And there is no way he would have left.\"\nChristina Hanson\nThe family of Christina Hanson searched frantically before learning she had died.\nChristina Hanson saw the flames coming from afar. But the 28-year-old, who lived in an apartment next to her father's house in Santa Rosa, used a wheelchair.\nHanson first tried to reach her father, but to no avail, her aunt Cathy Riordan said. She then called her father's ex-wife, saying she saw an inferno and was scared.\nConcerned neighbors told the family they called 911 to the property, but it's unclear what happened after those calls, Riordan said.\nAfter a day of panic and uncertainty, Christina's cousin confirmed she had died.\n\"Sadly, we just found out that Christina did not survive the fire,\" cousin Brittney Vinculado said Wednesday.\nHanson's father, 55-year-old Michael Hanson, suffered third-degree burns on over half his body and was at Sutter Santa Rosa Regional Hospital before it was evacuated, Riordan said. He was in a medically induced coma.\nSutter tried to transfer him by helicopter to San Francisco for treatment, but smoke prevented the chopper from taking off, Riordan said. Instead, he was transferred by ambulance.\nRiordan said she believes her brother was injured trying to help his daughter.\n\"I know that's how he got burned,\" she said. \"(He) was trying to save her.\"\nThe loved ones still missing\nMore than 600 people have been reported missing, but 315 of them have been located, authorities said. Spotty cellphone service has severely hampered relatives' ability to connect. Sonoma County deputies continue to search for 285 missing people, officials said.\nFlames ravage a home in California's Napa wine region as multiple wind-driven fires continue whipping the region.\nThe situation could worsen, as firefighters keep battling 22 wildfires that have already scorched 170,000 acres.\nFirefighters are battling 22 wildfires in California that have burned nearly 170,000 acres. Latest on the fires: https://t.co/OtkdreDFEq pic.twitter.com/bWYpWilVsu\nSanta Rosa man hopes missing father is alive\nDerek Southard hasn't heard from his 71-year-old father, Daniel, since Sunday night.\nSouthard, 29, lives with his father in Santa Rosa, California, but he attended a wedding nearly three hours away in Monterey on Sunday while his father stayed home.\n\"I had been texting him that day at the wedding. I told him I'd call him that night. And then he never called me back,\" Southard said, crying. \"He texted me at midnight and asked if I was having fun at the wedding. I guess the fire came an hour or two after that.\"\nSouthard said the family reported his father missing on Monday.\nWhen Derek got back to Santa Rosa on Monday, the neighborhood was still closed off. He called the sheriff and asked him to check on his father.\n\"The sheriff said his house was burned to the ground and his car was melted in the driveway, but I've still got my fingers crossed that he made it out somehow,\" Southard wrote Tuesday on Facebook.\nTheir next-door neighbors barely escaped the flames but they didn't have time to knock on his father's door, Southard said.\n\"As they were leaving, people were driving by and honking horns to try and wake people up,\" said Southard, who is staying with his girlfriend's family in San Francisco.\nBut Southard worries his father, who has trouble sleeping and takes sleeping pills, didn't hear the commotion. \"He's 71 and pretty hard of hearing,\" he said.\nSobbing, Southard said: \"I lost everything. My dad, my car and my dog and everything around.\"\n'They're absolutely terrified'\nRachael Ingram last heard from her close friend, Mike Grabow, late Sunday night when he told her the air was smoky as he drove to his Santa Rosa home.\n\"He knew it was bad,\" the 28-year-old Ingram told CNN.\nShe and Grabow, 40, had been at the Cooperage Brewing Company in Santa Rosa, where she is a bartender. The pair, friends for more than eight years, had been looking at maps of where the wildfires were before Grabow left to drive home.\nIngram, also a Santa Rosa resident, said she reported Grabow missing right away.\nIngram wrote on Facebook that she checked hospitals and the Red Cross shelter database, and listed Grabow with the fire department and sheriff's hotline.\n\"We have a pretty solid core group of friends that have been looking for him,\" she said. \"If he didn't show up at any of our houses,that's an immediate red flag for us. I called his brother first and alerted him and asked him to help,\" she said.\nThe brother went to Grabow's home on Monday and discovered the blaze had destroyed the home. The fire had melted the glass on Grabow's truck, Ingram said.\n\"He has tons of family in Idaho that are really worried about him, as well as family in Washington. I want to acknowledge what they're going through,\" Ingram said.\n\"They're absolutely terrified and we're trying to help them,\" she added.\nCNN's Paul Murphy, Laura Díaz-Zúñiga, Jason Hanna and Darran Simon contributed to this report.\n",
