        "text": "Too many humans in the Northern Hemisphere have been horribly affected by recent mega-hurricanes—“Harvey,” Texas; “Irma,” Caribbean Islands, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Florida—which may not be “Nature’s wrath,” but something even more sinister with several more on the way! However, there are skeptics, who can’t believe what is happening can have inputs from weather technologies, so exaggerated in capabilities they just may result in bankrupting governments, economies and financial systems, and severely limiting resources like food, water, and shelter for months!\nThis author has had some very intelligent people contact her saying they think weather geoengineering is a “conspiracy theory” or “hoax,” so she asked her Editor to republish the article she wrote in January of 2015, which you will find in full below the first video.\nSomething just may ring a bell now. How much more devastation do we want to live through, not only here, but globally?\nHere’s a major scientist on CBS TV News telling us what’s been going on.\nOver the years, The Washington Post acquired numerous awards for excellent investigative journalism, etc., including the prestigious Pulitzer Prize several times, the last being in 2014. One would imagine—at least this writer’s journalistic opinion—that extensive and accurate research would be the ground floor for factual, open-source, non-pejorative, non-ad hominem reporting and journalism.\nWhen journalist Puneet Kollipara postulates, “Meet the “chemtrails” crowd, who posit that governments, scientists and other institutions are using airplanes’ “chemtrails” — basically contrails that are allegedly laced with chemicals — to alter the climate, create extreme weather, poison people, or even control our minds,” and “In short, chemtrails itself is a conspiracy theory,” someone needs to point out that The Washington Post team should have done their homework more diligently, as there are hundreds of federal government agency reports and, in particular, U.S. Patents of record, for managing weather systems. Many are listed below in the Weather Geoengineering / Chemtrail Database generated by this writer.\nHowever, I think maybe I may be inclined to agree with Kollipara that chemtrails just may be a conspiracy—a real ‘true’ conspiracy to keep what’s going on day and night – and which darkens our skies ( less sunlight hits earth now ), plus precipitates all kinds of toxic crap falling onto earth—to keep the public from knowing what’s actually going on above our heads.\nFor decades weather control, AKA weather geoengineering, has been going on—it’s a given that patents verify. However, a complacent media, press, TV, probably some ‘politicos’ from previous administrations, select bureaucrats in government, government agencies per se, namely: US Air Force and Navy, researchers, and specialty contractors who build and carry out systems to fulfill the agenda—ALL have kept silent and definitely either apparently conspired or colluded to agree to keep silent—or else. Where are the whistleblowers? Could some wannabe whistleblowers be dead?\nWhy hasn’t any media outlet, investigative journalist or newspaper, the U.S. Congress or some foreign investigator/researcher questioned the sky trails during the last couple decades? Furthermore, why—whenever something crops up about chemtrails—is it immediately scandalized as ‘conspiracy’, rather than addressed with scientific facts and reported as news?\nBelow is a database of legal documentation (U.S. Patents) that evidences weather geoengineering is real. Furthermore, many patents cannot be employed or used unless there is aerial spraying.\nFirst, we need to study two weather maps, which apparently show that there really is a split weather pattern in the continental USA.\n“Two Pictures Worth More Than a Thousand Words!”\nSame source as above\nThe above global-climate-temperature map readily illustrates how the eastern parts of the USA and the North American continent apparently have become targeted areas for cold/rain/ice/snow weather geoengineering. Moreover, it supports the first map and the divide seen between the hot/dry west and the cold/wet east. That weather system probably can be accomplished only with aerial spraying of aerosolized chemicals and toxic elements, since natural weather patterns apparently don’t have ‘split personalities’. Documents from government and other mainstream resources, plus the investigative alternate press, confirm chemtrail activity, which really is weather geoengineering.
