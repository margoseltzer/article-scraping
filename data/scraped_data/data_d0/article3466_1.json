Around 150 media outlets have also been shut and some 160 journalists jailed, the Turkish Journalists Association says.\nA prosecutor has called for jail sentences of up to 15 years on terrorism charges for rights activists including the local head of Amnesty International, Amnesty said on Sunday.\nCritics say Turkey is sliding toward greater authoritarianism. The government says such measures are necessary, given the vast security threats it is facing.\nReporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n",
