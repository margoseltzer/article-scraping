The Observatory said some of them had crossed with groups of civilians.\nAlthough Islamic State and the groups that make up Tahrir al-Sham, including the Nusra Front, subscribe to hardline jihadist ideology, they have opposed each other for years.\nIslamic State has not held territory abutting areas held by jihadists or other rebel groups in northwest Syria, the most populous area held by the insurgency, since last year.\nIt has since lost swathes of ground to the Syrian army, backed by Russia, Iran and Shi’ite militias, and a rival campaign by Kurdish and Arab groups in the north supported by the United States.\nReporting by Lisa Barrington and Ellen Francis in Beirut and Mohamed el Sherif in Cairo; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n",
