Add your two cents.\nBroncos President of Football Ops/GM John Elway has spoken some pretty strong words after a weekend full of protests around the NFL after the words of President Donald Trump last Friday.\nA number of teams and players did things like lock arms, take knees, and even stay in the locker room instead of standing like normal for the anthem.\nElway stated that he ‘believes’ in standing for the anthem, and that the United States in the greatest country in the world. He went on in his statement to say that he knows ‘that there are a lot of things that need to be corrected,’ but went on to say that he hopes the players can get back more to focusing on playing.\nYou can see Elway’s complete comments in the picture above.\n \nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
