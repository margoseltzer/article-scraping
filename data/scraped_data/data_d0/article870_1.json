When the debate starts at 9 p.m., Stein's campaign says she will \"participate live in the debate on social media.\"\nStein didn't pass the 15 percent national polling threshold to qualify for the debate, and neither did Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson. Johnson's campaign said he, along with running mate Bill Weld, will be New York City on debate day. The pair plan to watch the debate live and live-tweet from their Twitter accounts.\nPolitico Magazine\nBy Austin Sarat and Jonathan Obert\n",
