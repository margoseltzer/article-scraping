        "text": "Powell leakers strike again with alleged White House staffer emails, Michelle Obama passport\nThe hacker website that leaked Colin Powell's politically embarrassing emails struck again Thursday, this time releasing what appears to be the personal emails of a White House staffer working with Hillary Clinton’s campaign — and what purports to be an image of Michelle Obama’s passport.\nAn initial scan of the messages appear to show chatter mostly regarding event planning details, such as requesting an invoice for a stage used at a Clinton campaign event. In one exchange, the advanced planning team expresses concern that the media might notice a group of protesters at one event.\nStory Continued Below\nThe emails appear to be taken from the staffer's personal Gmail account, and span from February 2015 to July of this year.\nA Secret Service spokeswoman said the agency was “aware of the alleged email hacking of a White House employee.”\n“The Secret Service is concerned any time unauthorized information that might pertain to one of the individuals we protect, or our operations, is allegedly disclosed,” spokeswoman Nicole Mainor told POLITICO. “As a matter of policy, we do not provide information regarding investigations.”\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to discuss the leak at his daily briefing.\n“Administration officials are taking a look at the information that’s been disclosed,” Earnest told reporters. “Obviously we take any reports about a cyber breach seriously, particularly if it may include some sensitive information.”\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch told reporters that the Justice Department is \"aware of those media reports.\"\n\"It is something that we're looking into,\" she said.\nAccording to a LinkedIn page, the staffer has worked as an advance associate for the White House since April 2015. The staffer also appears to work with the Clinton campaign as an event organizer.\nThe email dump was posted late Wednesday on the purported anti-secrecy site DC Leaks, which security experts have connected to the suspected Russian cyberattack campaign targeting U.S. political institutions and state election offices.\nMost notably, the site has also posted the pilfered private emails of Powell, as well as the alleged communications of other Clinton campaign workers and a few Republican lawmakers who have been critical of the Russian regime, including Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham .\nEarly on Thursday, the DC Leaks Twitter account posted the purported image of Michelle Obama's passport.\nThe emails may have been stolen during a previously reported cyberattack campaign that targeted at the personal email accounts of at least 26 Clinton campaign staffers and volunteers. Digital forensic experts have tied that digital assault to the same Russian hacking group that is believed to have also infiltrated other top Democratic institutions, including the Democratic National Committee.\nThis article tagged under:\nPolitico Magazine\nBy Austin Sarat and Jonathan Obert\n",
