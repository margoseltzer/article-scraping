        "text": "Eight in 10 agree Donald Trump lost the first debate. But Republicans aren't convinced it will hurt him.\n09/27/2016 02:06 AM EDT\nRoughly 80 percent of insiders — with equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans responding to the post-debate survey — said Clinton did the better job at the debate. | Illustration by POLITICO / AP Photo\nHEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — Score round 1 for Hillary Clinton.\nThat’s according to The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of swing-state activists, strategists and operatives who watched the first debate here Monday night. The insiders’ bipartisan verdict: Clinton dispatched Donald Trump in their first of three nationally televised meetings.\nStory Continued Below\nOverall, roughly 80 percent of insiders — with equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans responding to the post-debate survey — said Clinton did the better job at the debate, including 99 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of Republicans. Only 21 percent — 1 percent of Democrats and 43 percent of Republicans — picked Trump as the winner.\nDemocrats said Clinton was prepared and succeeded in provoking Trump — who began the debate speaking so quietly the audio engineers struggled to raise his volume to a comparable level in the debate hall but quickly became more animated in the face of Clinton’s attacks.\n“No contest,” said an Iowa Democrat — who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. “Trump held it together for 16 minutes and fell apart.”\n“Trump melted down,” added a Florida Democrat. “This is bad for him. [It] confirms all the worries of swing voters.”\nSome Democrats predicted the debate would swing the momentum, which appeared to be with Trump, with public polls showing a tightening race.\n“Donald Trump exposed himself to be a clown,” added a New Hampshire Democrat, who also predicted “the polls will show dramatic movement in next 24 hours.”\nBut a Florida Democrat countered that Clinton’s performance was unlikely to change fundamentally the trajectory of the race.\n“It is becoming a base turnout election, and she did a great job tonight of making the stakes in this election very clear,” the Democrat said.\nAmong Republicans, the tally was closer — but that speaks to a divided party as much as actual ambivalence about which candidate performed better on Monday night.\n“Trump was an embarrassment,” an Iowa Republican said. “I'd hate to be the guy in the spin room lying about how Trump won the debate.”\n“It wasn't close,” a Virginia Republican added. “Sure, our tribal politics will force it to seem somewhat close, but even the most committed of Trump supporters know, deep down, that did not go well.”\nBut there was a significant share of Republicans who thought Trump won — most of whom said Trump’s outside appeal could be the most memorable aspect of the debate.\n“Hillary Clinton sounded like every politician has sounded for the last half century. Donald Trump did not,” said an Ohio Republican. “This year that may just be enough.”\n“Neither candidate earned a single undecided vote,” a Nevada Republican added. “Clinton supporters will think she won. Trump supporters will think he won. Trump gets the nod because he did not completely implode.”\nHere are two other takeaways from the first debate:\nClinton met expectations on Monday night, while insiders are mixed on Trump.\nThe vast majority of all insiders, 88 percent, said Clinton met expectations going into Monday night. That includes nearly three-quarters of Republicans: One Florida Republican called Clinton “calm in the face of an insane person.”\nInsiders were more mixed on Trump, on the other hand. Overall, 55 percent of insiders said Trump met expectations: 40 percent of Democrats and 68 percent of Republicans.\n“There were no expectations,” said an Iowa Republican. “He got off to a great start, appeared reserved, but then he took the bait. The sneers and reactions when Clinton was speaking undercut his first impression.”\nBut for some Republicans, meeting expectations wasn’t good enough.\nThe expectations “were low,” said one Pennsylvania Republican. “He needed to exceed [them], and he didn't.”\nAnd a Virginia Republican said Trump did little to appeal to a key group of Republican-leaning voters whom Trump is repelling this year: white-collar whites.\n“He needs college whites, and he didn't connect,” the Republican said.\nRepublicans are divided on the political impact of the debate.\nGOP insiders aren’t sure whether Trump is better or worse off after the Monday night debate.\nAsked whether Trump’s performance makes it more likely he wins the race, just 31 percent said yes — comparable to the 33 percent who said it doesn’t. A slim plurality, 36 percent, said the debate wouldn’t have a significant impact on Trump’s chances.\nThe debate was “not fatal, but very definitely a missed opportunity,” said one New Hampshire Republican.\n\"Neither of them made a persuasive case that they were more fit than the other to be president. At this point that advantages Trump,\" said an Ohio Republican.\n“Put plainly: he failed the presidential test,” a Virginia Republican added. “And hiding out on Fox News isn't going to fix it for him.”\nBut despite — or perhaps because of — Trump’s unconventional debate style, some insiders said his message could resonate more than the pundits think in the immediate wake of the debate.\n“He spoke in a language that normal Americans understand,” a Virginia Republican said.\n“America is looking for something different,” a Colorado Republican added. “He is very different.”\n09/27/16 02:09 AM EDT\nAnd some Republicans cautioned against reading too much into the first match-up.\n“There are two more debates to watch,” said a Virginia Republican. “Trump has more he can adjust, [while] Hillary is a fixed quantity as a virtual 30-year political incumbent. Trump will be more aggressive in the next two debates.”\nAmong Democrats, it was more decisive: 60 percent said the debate made it less likely Trump becomes president, compared to 15 percent who said it makes it more likely and 25 percent who said it wouldn’t have an impact.\n“Trump wasn't presidential,” a Colorado Democrat said. “He needed to show restraint, and he failed. Tonight was his opportunity to show the country how he would govern, and he missed the opportunity.”\nThese are the members of The POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated in this special survey:\nColorado: Ryan Call, Laura Carno, Matt Chandler, Will Coyne, Adam Eichberg, Mark Ferrandino, Cole Finegan, Michael Fortney, Andrew Freedman, Ted Harvey, Craig Hughes, Owen Loftus, Pete Maysmith, Frank McNulty, Karen Middleton, Christopher Murray, BJ Nikkel, Josh Penry, Rick Ridder, Alan Salazar, Janice Sinden, Pat Steadman, Pat Waak, Steve Welchert, Taylor West, Roxane White, Rob Witwer\nFlorida: Fernand Amandi, Scott Arceneaux, JP Austin, Tim Baker, Dennis K.
