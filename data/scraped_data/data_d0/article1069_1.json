I will tell them, ‘f--k you.’ You’re doing it in atonement for your sins,” he told local government officials in Davao City, media in the Philippines reported.\nThe president said EU nations were hypocrites for attacking him because of their own bloody histories. \"And then EU now has the gall to condemn me. I repeat it, ‘f--k you,’” he said.\nDuterte earlier this month called Barack Obama a \"son of a b--ch\" when it was suggested he would face questioning by the U.S. president about the war on drug crime, which has claimed more than 2,400 lives in just over two months.\nLog-in\nPassword\nRemember me\nLog in\n",
