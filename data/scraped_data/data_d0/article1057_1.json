But Hillary Clinton had the far better night in their first 90-minute (it actually lasted 95 minutes) matchup here at Hofstra University on Long Island. Clinton mostly kept her cool -- as did Trump for the first portion of the evening. Trump ended up citing Sid Blumenthal, Rosie O’Donnell and referring viewers to Sean Hannity to vouch for his opposition to the Iraq War. The pre-debate buzz among reporters here was that Trump left himself the option to come to the spin room, but would only show up if he needed to change the narrative. He came to the spin room, and then spoke to Hannity live from the press filing center. Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) pointed out that “she can’t remember last time, if ever, a general election candidate went to the spin room.” Not a good sign for Trump.\nLAST NIGHT Hillary Clinton ended the debate by saying, “And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman Ms. Piggy. Then he called her Ms. Housekeeping, because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name...Her name is Alicia Machado and she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet she's going to vote this November.\"\nTHIS MORNING Donald Trump went on “Fox and Friends” and said Machado was “the worst” contestant they had and chided her for gaining weight. “She was impossible...She was the winner and you know she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem...This was many years ago, and [Clinton] found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa and it wasn’t quite that way, but that’s okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do.” Video clip http://bit.ly/2cA06xi (h/t Alex Burns)\n**SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/1M75UbX\n--WHAT’S NEXT: The next presidential debate -- in St. Louis on Oct. 9 -- gives Trump an opportunity to bounce back. Remember: Mitt Romney trounced Barack Obama in the first debate. But the second event, which will be held at Wash. U., is a town hall, which brings its own challenges for both candidates. Clinton mostly skated on some of Trump’s signature attacks: Benghazi, her private email server, the FBI investigation, immigration and the Clinton Foundation. Trump is certain to hammer away on those issues in the coming weeks, and try to inject them into the conversation in Missouri. The vice presidential debate is in Farmville, Virginia, on Oct. 4 -- one week from today.\nWHAT TO WATCH FOR: How the down-ballot candidates react. Top Republican operatives running Senate and House races say they weren’t thrilled, but they don’t know that Trump’s bad night moves the needle. The early take is that Trump was stable for the first 30 minutes, which gives Republicans hope that any negative impact will be limited.\n42 DAYS until Election Day. The government shuts down Friday.\nTHE NARRATIVE -- “Clinton set the trap and Trump walked in: The Democrat dominated the debate. Will it matter?” by Eli Stokols: “‘Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that’s all to his benefit,’ Clinton started. ‘He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.’ Trump quickly dismissed Clinton’s characterization, saying he received ‘a very small loan’ that he turned into a company valued, he claimed, in the billions. ‘I say that only because that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs.’ In the moment, he seemed calm—but from that point forward he was anything but. ‘She mind-screwed him from the beginning by mentioning the loan from his father,’ said Rob Stutzman, a GOP operative in California. ‘That was brilliant psychological warfare on her part. He slowly unwound from there, culminating in borderline incoherency over the final 30 minutes.’” http://politi.co/2cynqH0\nJMART and PAT HEALY on A1 of the NYT, “CANDIDATES PRESS POINTED ATTACKS IN ACERBIC DEBATE -- Trump Raps Clinton on Trade and Email -- She Counters on His Fitness”: “In a relentlessly antagonistic debate, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed over trade, the Iraq war, his refusal to release his tax returns and her use of a private email server, with Mr. Trump frequently showing impatience and political inexperience as Mrs. Clinton pushed him to defend his past denigration of women and President Obama. Mr. Trump repeatedly interrupted Mrs. Clinton and at times talked over her throughout the 90-minute debate, making slashing attacks that surely pleased his Republican base but may have been off-putting to women and undecided voters. He also left unchallenged her assertion that he paid no federal taxes for years.” http://nyti.ms/2cyicen … A1 PDF http://nyti.ms/2cZMY2O\n--WaPo leadall by Phil Rucker and Anne Gearan: “Donald Trump unrelentingly blamed the nation’s chronic problems on ‘typical politician’ Hillary Clinton, yet he found himself mostly on the defensive in their first debate here Monday night as she denounced him for racial insensitivity, hiding potential conflicts of interest and ‘stiffing’ those who helped build his business empire … Trump … spent much of the evening explaining himself — over his temperament, treatment of women and minorities, business practices and readiness to be commander in chief, as well as over his long perpetuation of a falsehood about Barack Obama’s birthplace to delegitimize his presidency. ‘He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior, and the birther lie was a very hurtful one,’ said Clinton ... ‘Barack Obama is a man of great dignity, and I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.’ Trump, who earlier this month at last acknowledged Obama’s birth in Hawaii, replied by invoking Clinton’s 2008 rivalry with Obama: ‘When you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn’t work.’” http://wapo.st/2dokMt5\nFOR REFERENCE -- The full transcript http://politi.co/2doh9Dw\nGOTHAM WATCH -- N.Y.

Trump is supposed to be the big meanie but it was Clinton who hit him where it hurt most … What about the Clinton Foundation? The former secretary's debate team … expected him to savage her on the various questions raised about her family's foundation. They were worried about it. While he hammered her ever-so-briefly on emails, he was so engaged in self-justification, he flat-out forgot to pursue an attack that could have made the night a lot less lousy. His ‘30 years’ attack worked - and he’ll use it again … [T]here were a few gold nuggets strewn in the wreckage of Hofstra - the most valuable an assault (demonstrable and fact-checker-friendly) on Clinton’s effectiveness in 25-plus years of public life …\n“Clinton effectively attacked his business career … Clinton plucked the strains of what could be a genuine crossover hit this fall among ever-elusive white working-class voters and independents: Trump’s failure to turn over his tax returns. Clinton went there with a vengeance – engaging in a little Trump-esque fact-free speculation about the motives of the billionaire developer-turned-reality TV star … Her most effective attack - and his worst answer. If the GOP nominee needed any more proof that preparation trumps bombast in a general election debate, he got it when Clinton launched a merciless attack on his habit of stiffing contractors who have labored on his construction projects over the years.” http://politi.co/2czumZu\n--@realDonaldTrump: “Nothing on emails. Nothing on the corrupt Clinton Foundation. And nothing on #Benghazi. #Debates2016 #debatenight … Wow, did great in the debate polls (except for @CNN - which I don’t watch).

Clinton also was seen as having done a better job addressing concerns voters might have about her potential presidency by a 57% to 35% margin, and as the stronger leader by a 56% to 39% margin. The gap was smaller on which candidate appeared more sincere and authentic, though still broke in Clinton's favor, with 53% saying she was more sincere vs. 40% who felt Trump did better on that score. Trump topped Clinton 56% to 33% as the debater who spent more time attacking their opponent.” http://cnn.it/2cHKPZQ\n--@NateSilver538: “Clinton’s 35-point win in the CNN post-debate poll is the 3rd largest margin ever, after Romney-Obama I and Clinton-Bush 92 townhall.”\nLUNTZ’S FOCUS GROUP -- CLINTON WINS -- “Hillary Clinton came better prepared for tonight’s debate than any candidate in recent memory. She knew when to attack and when to explain – and how to pace it all over 90 minutes. Donald Trump started off great for the first few questions. He had an effective refrain of slamming Clinton’s ‘30 years’ of nothing, which resonated particularly well with independent voters. For the first 15-20 minutes, Trump’s numbers consistently went up whenever he railed against the current system and all its problems. Trump talked a lot about problems. But Clinton talked about solutions. ...\n“At the end of the night, Clinton moved the dials more with my group – 16 voters declared her the debate winner, while five said Trump won. Focus group consisted of 27 participants, all undecided voters from Pennsylvania. Pre-Debate: 10 leaned toward Clinton, six leaned toward Trump, and 11 were neutral. Post-Debate: 13 leaned toward Clinton, five leaned toward Trump, and nine were neutral.”\nNEW ADS -- Priorities USA is up with a new TV swing-state ad called “My Temperament” in Ohio, Florida, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Iowa, New Hampshire and North Carolina. http://bit.ly/2dg6vtN … Future45 -- a super PAC backed by the Ricketts and Adelson families -- is rotating this new ad called “Bad Experience” into its national TV buy http://bit.ly/2cyrrv1\nHAPPENING TODAY -- Today is National Voter Registration Day.

Drudge, “Fire!” (an early banner featured a reader poll saying Trump won the debate)\nMEDIAWATCH -- “Lester Holt stays out of the way,” by Hadas Gold: “Lester Holt was on an island on Monday night. And for most of the first presidential debate, he stayed there, letting the battleships of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump shoot their missiles at one another. It made for some memorable exchanges between Trump and Clinton, matched in close-up on most networks. For some debate watchers, that’s what they want their moderators to do: say ‘go’ and let them run. But it also left some gaps where viewers probably expected sharp questions.\n“There was no probing of Trump’s wall with Mexico, and vow to get the Mexicans to pay for it, or the Republican nominee’s ban on Muslims entering the country. And he barely prodded Clinton to explain her private email server in a question so gently worded that she was able to dispatch the issue with a few taut sentences.The Clinton Foundation? Wasn’t discussed; neither was the Benghazi attack. Few moderators have faced such intense scrutiny in the days leading up to the debate as Holt did, with Clinton’s allies demanding he serve as a fact-checker and Trump’s backers insisting that he allow the candidates to have their say.” http://politi.co/2dyVlEm\n-- “Donald Trump Says Lester Holt Did ‘Great Job,’ but Some Surrogates Disagree,” by WSJ’s Reid Epstein in Hempstead: “‘There were a few issues I felt like he should have raised, like the Clinton Foundation, that were not raised,’ Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions said. ‘I would liked to have had a good discussion of [immigration]. … A good discussion of it would have been healthy.’ … ‘I thought he could have asked her more questions,’ [New York GOP Rep. Peter] King said. ‘If he was going to ask Donald Trump about his taxes he certainly could have asked Hillary Clinton about all the money she got from Wall Street and refuses to disclose the speeches that she made. You know, you have the moderator you have and you don’t complain about it.’” http://on.wsj.com/2doqqvs\nINSIDE THE CAMPAIGNS -- “The Myth Of ‘Trump-Whisperer’ Kellyanne Conway,” by BuzzFeed’s McKay Coppins: “[A]s the race has narrowed, Conway has emerged in the popular imagination of politicos and pundits as the deft handler who’s finally succeeded in domesticating Trump. … Interviews this week with more than half a dozen GOP sources close to the campaign suggest her ‘Trump-whisperer’ status is more made-for-TV myth than reality. ... [T]he biggest factor driving Conway’s outsize public reputation is her omnipresence on television. She spends far more time in front of the cameras than typical campaign managers do, appearing constantly on cable news, network morning shows, and even Bill Maher’s HBO talk show Real Time … Some have questioned whether it’s possible for her to effectively manage a national presidential campaign from a green room.” http://bzfd.it/2cZOsdn\nA message from Softbank:\nWe're on track to invest $50 billion in U.S. companies by the end of 2020. Learn more about SoftBank's investment in the U.S. at politico.com/sponsor-content/softbank.\nBEYOND THE BELTWAY -- “Uprising activists: Charlotte mayor, police chief should resign,” by Charlotte Observer’s Ann Doss Helms: “Local and state activists called Monday for Police Chief Kerr Putney and Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts to resign, as the city’s latest round of tension between police and the black community moves into its second week. At a Monday news conference held by Charlotte Uprising, a coalition that emerged during last week’s protests, speakers said both officials have failed to protect the city’s African American and working class citizens and withheld information about two fatal shootings last week.” http://bit.ly/2dcErt3\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK – New Hillary video: “Which version of Donald Trump showed up at the debate?” http://bit.ly/2d5ISHg\n-- Former Rep. Gabby Giffords and her husband Captain Mark Kelly on gun violence in the first debate: “Donald Trump paid lip service to gun safety, which is no surprise because it's this year's political high ground. However, we know he supports the gun lobby's efforts to protect loopholes that let criminals get guns. That's dangerous, and it puts our communities at risk. Hillary, on the other hand, was passionate and forceful in her support of stronger gun laws that save lives.” The statement comes as they are launching a 14-state “Vocal Majority Tour” to try and make the 2016 election a referendum on gun safety.\nFUTURECAST – “Uber is researching a new vertical-takeoff ride offering that flies you around,” by Re/code’s Kara Swisher: “[T]he fast-growing ride-sharing company [is] seriously looking at a new form of transportation to offer its customers: Short-haul flying in cities. The technology is called VTOL — which stands for vertical takeoff and landing. Simply put, VTOL is an aircraft that can hover, take off and land vertically, which would also describe a helicopter. But, unlike the typical helicopter, these planes have multiple rotors, could have fixed wings and perhaps eventually would use batteries and be more silent. In time, like cars, such aircraft would be autonomous.” http://on.recode.net/2cRVjDT\nVALLEY WATCH -- “Disney Considers Offer for Twitter: Sale process in early stages and follows announcement of Twitter talks with Salesforce,” by WSJ’s Dana Cimilluca, Joann Lublin and Erich Schwartzel: “Twitter, with a stock-market value of about $20 billion, has also held preliminary talks with Salesforce.com Inc. … The sale process is in early stages and it is far from guaranteed that anyone will end up buying Twitter.” http://on.wsj.com/2cypu1E\nPlaybookers\nSep 25, 2016 at 11:38pm PDT\nSPOTTED at the debate, per pooler Zeke Miller: “Mark Cuban (who appears to be seated in the front row), Dan Malloy, Jesse Jackson, Andrew Cuomo and Sandra Lee, Reince and Sally Priebus, Donna Brazile, Don King, Rudy Giuliani in conversation with Sheldon Adelson ...

Mike Pence sitting up front”\n2016 PLAYERS -- “How a Young Campaign Staffer Battling Stage 4 Cancer Helped Hillary Clinton Decide Her VP,” by People’s Sandra Sobieraj Westfall: “When Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine talked with PEOPLE about their budding partnership, one mysterious bit in the interview stood out: ‘Some of my staffers,’ the senator from Virginia said to Clinton softly, ‘we have been through some challenging times, and you have taken good care of them.’ Enter Tyrone Gayle. Because the ‘some of my staffers’ turns out to be Gayle – and the ‘some challenging times’ is Gayle's life-and-death battle with Stage 4 colon cancer. Gayle, 28, was just about marking his one-year anniversary as a domestic-policy spokesman at Clinton's Brooklyn, New York, campaign headquarters last March when the diagnosis upended his world.” http://bit.ly/2d5OTDY\nHOT DOC -- WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD! -- Rep.
