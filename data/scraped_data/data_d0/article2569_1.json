        "text": "Photographer killed in Mexico as journalist death toll nears record\n3 Min Read\nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The bullet-riddled body of a news photographer was found in central Mexico on Friday, state officials, putting 2017 on track to become the deadliest year yet for journalists in the notoriously violent country.\nEdgar Daniel Esqueda, 23, who worked with Metropoli San Luis and Vox Populi SLP in the state of San Luis Potosi, was found in the state capital with at least three bullet wounds in the back of his neck, authorities said.\nThe news outlets where Esqueda worked reported had reported his abduction from his home by gunmen on Thursday morning.\nSan Luis Potosi’s governor, Manuel Carreras, told a press conference an investigation was underway. He did not say whether  Esqueda’s murder was linked to his work as a journalist.\nWith Esqueda’s killing, 2017 could become the bloodiest  year yet for reporters in Mexico, according to press freedom and journalists’ advocacy group Articulo 19.\nThe photo journalist was the 11th reporter killed so far this year, the group said. That matched the total in 2016, which was the highest number on record in a country torn by runaway levels of criminal and drug-related bloodletting.\nOver the past 17 years, 111 journalists have been killed in Mexico, 38 of them under the current government of President Enrique Pena Nieto.\nReporters Without Borders and the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (CPJ) both rank Mexico among the deadliest countries in the world for reporters.\nActivists have repeatedly criticized Mexican prosecutors for failing to fully investigate many journalists’ murders, allowing the killers to operate with impunity.\nMexico’s human rights commission has asked state authorities to provide protection for Esqueda’s family members, who were at home with the photographer when he was taken by force, according to Articulo 19.\nWitnesses who spoke with the group said Esqueda asked his kidnappers for their identity when they broke into the home where he was asleep with his wife, and they responded that they were police officers.\nThe state police force said via Twitter that “there has not been any police action against a reporter in the capital.”\n“Criminals, sometimes connected with state actors, know that they can get away with killing journalists in Mexico because of  chronic impunity for these crimes. Until that changes, the violence will continue,” Alexandra Ellerbeck, the CPJ’s program coordinator for North America, said in a statement.\nEsqueda had reported threats months ago to a government-run human rights group in San Luis Potosi, one of his colleagues told Reuters.\nReporting by Daina Beth Solomon and Christine Murray; Editing by Tom Brown\n",
