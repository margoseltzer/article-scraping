        "text": "Nobel Prize in Physics goes to 'black hole telescope' trio\nBy Angela Dewan and Manisha Ganguly, CNN\nUpdated 12:13 PM ET, Tue October 3, 2017\nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\nJUST WATCHED\nThe development proves Einstein's prediction of gravitational waves\nMore than 1,000 people worked on the technology over four decades\n(CNN)\nThe 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish and Kip S. Thorne for their detection of gravitational waves, a development scientists believe could give vital clues to the origins of the universe.\nThe three American physicists \"made decisive contributions\" to LIGO, an observatory instrument that enabled scientists to physically detect the waves, which Albert Einstein predicted a century ago in his theory of relativity.\nGravitational waves are \"ripples\" in the fabric of space and time caused by some of the most violent and energetic processes in the universe, according to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).\nNASA astronaut Mae Jemison, second right, with the recipients of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics, from left, Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish and Kip S. Thorne.\nThe strongest gravitational waves are produced by catastrophic events, such as colliding black holes, and the LIGO detector is essentially a \"black hole telescope,\" allowing scientists to \"see\" what was previously invisible.\nRead More\n\"The waves, which were predicted by Albert Einstein a hundred years ago, came from a collision between two black holes. It took 1.3 billion years for the waves to arrive at the LIGO detector in the USA.\n\"The signal was extremely weak when it reached Earth, but is already promising a revolution in astrophysics,\" the committee added.\n\"Gravitational waves are an entirely new way of observing the most violent events in space and testing the limits of our knowledge.\"\nLIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) a collaborative project with over 1,000 researchers from more than 20 countries. pic.twitter.com/dOjyKx2qUd\n'Look deeper into the universe'\nThe award was given half to Weiss from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the other half jointly to Barish and Thorne from Caltech.\nAround 1,000 people have worked on the development of the technology over four decades, according to Weiss and the Nobel committee.\n\"(They are) people who have been thinking about this, sometimes failing and slowly getting the technology together to do this -- it's exciting that they're finally doing this,\" Weiss said, speaking at the conference by phone.\nThe waves came from a collision between two black holes. It took 1.3 billion years for the waves to arrive at the LIGO detector in the USA. pic.twitter.com/kg6vQbIm7t\nHe said that as the detectors develop and become more sensitive, scientists will be able to look deeper into the universe and gain more insights into the origins of the universe.\n\"We fully expect to learn about things we didn't know about, not just black holes.\"\nProfessor Sheila Rowan, Director of the University of Glasgow's Institute for Gravitational Research, was one of the UK's leads on LIGO and welcomed the Nobel committee's decision.\n\"The discovery of the existence of gravitational waves, just over two years ago, has opened up a whole new way to understand the universe,\" she said.\nEach of the six Nobel prizes come with an award of 9 million Swedish kronor ($1.1 million), which is shared when there are multiple recipients.\nAlfred Nobel created five prizes in his 1895 will for medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace. A sixth prize in economics was created, in Nobel's memory, by Sweden's central bank in 1968.\n",
