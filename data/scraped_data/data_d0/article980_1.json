He loves people. And if all of this happens, there will be a great place for Ben,\" Trump said.\nCarson, who endorsed Trump in March, has repeatedly said that he is not seeking a position in a potential Trump White House.\n\"I don’t know if he wants that, but I know that he wants to help people,\" Trump said. \"But there will be a great place.\"\n",
