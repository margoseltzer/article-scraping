Add your two cents.\n\"Two Hearts, One Soul\" is the third single to be released from the CD For You. Grammy nominated Sylvia Bennett invites Hungarian violinist and bandleader Peter Ferencz, from the Smooth Jazz Pop ensemble, Peet Project to accompany her in a duet where voice and violin caress in a romantic dance.  Sylvia Bennett, along with her long-time producer, Hal S. Batt, collaborated to write \"Two Hearts, One Soul\" for her latest CD For You. It is the ultimate love song where the love is so deep between two people that their hearts are intertwined into one soul.  International recording artist and song–writer Sylvia Bennett has performed at Presidential Inaugurations and opened for such renowned artists as Bob Hope, Phyllis Diller, Jackie Mason, Dizzy Gillespie, Barry Gibb and David Brenner. Discovered by the legendary Lionel Hampton, she has since captivated audiences and critics alike with her sultry and honeyed toned voice.  Peter \"Peet\" Ferencz has enjoyed chart topping success of his own with his latest album The Bad Boys of Budapest. The first single, \"Rosy Cheeks,\" spent 14 weeks on the Billboard Smooth Jazz Top 30.  For You is available for sale on Amazon, iTunes, and CD Baby.
