Russia denied its aircraft were operating in the area at the time and suggested the U.S. was behind the attack,  claiming  a U.S. Predator drone was in the area when the vehicles, carrying desperately needed supplies to people under siege, were struck.\nMeanwhile, officials are scrambling to salvage a U.S.-Russia ceasefire agreement that went into effect September 12, with Washington calling for all war planes operating over Syria to be grounded, the BBC reported.\nAt the U.N., U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Syria's future was \"hanging by a thread,\" and flights had to be suspended \"in order to de-escalate the situation and give a chance for humanitarian assistance to flow unimpeded.\"\nLog-in\nPassword\nRemember me\nLog in\n",
