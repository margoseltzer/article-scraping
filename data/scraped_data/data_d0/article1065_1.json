Such attacks are \"symbols of a growing hate of foreigners.\" Excerpts of the report were published on Wednesday in the  Handelsblatt  newspaper after the business daily obtained a copy of it.\nThe \"worrying trend\" could \"threaten the peace of the Eastern German society,\" said Iris Gleicke according to Handelsblatt. Gleicke is a member of the government in charge of the country's former Eastern bloc that was under communist rule.\nAreas in former East Germany remain poorer than former West Germany, with a GDP about a quarter lower than in the West, the report said, adding that differences have largely disappeared since the reunification in 1990.\nAccording to statistics, hate crime in the East is well above the rest of the country. In the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where the far-right Alternative for Germany registered an unprecedented electoral success earlier this month, attacks on foreigners and migrants reached 58.7 per million inhabitants. The average for the western part of the country is 10.5, according to Handelsblatt.\nAuthorities started tracking violence against foreigners in 2001. It reached its peak in 2015, according to the report.\nThe report also warned that far-right groups have been gaining strength from rising hatred against foreigners, saying that one such terror organization known as the National Socialist Underground has killed 10 people in recent years.\nThe report noted that there are fewer foreigners in eastern Germany than in other parts of the country, underlining the fact that violence and hatred are not the result of the influx of migrants, but rather due to emigration from the East to other, richer parts of the country and a lack of social structures.\nAuthors:\nLog-in\nPassword\nRemember me\nLog in\n",
