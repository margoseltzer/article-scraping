        "text": "Total:\nLas Vegas Bombshell: Video Appears to Show Muzzle-Flash From 4th Floor, Not 32nd (Video)\nMonday, October 2, 2017 14:00\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nThe following is from the Red Elephants and I’ve found several videos below claiming the same thing. As well as videos of police scanner feeds during the horrible tragedy that took place. You can check out the videos below and here is the original twitter feed and feed back from the source.\nI have no idea if this video is real or click-bait but it appears to show muzzle-flash coming from somewhere around the 4th floor, not the 32nd. In my video from earlier today I showed you a video in which I couldn’t seen any muzzle-flash coming from the upper floors of the building. Well, this might explain some of that. Notice how small the flash is compared to the windows. It looks about right in terms of size at least. I can’t verify the source but I thought you guys might want too see it.\nYou can clearly see shots being fired from the 4th floor. Was there another shooter? #VegasShooting #PrayForVegas pic.twitter.com/UlVElrptXY\nWitness footage of gun attack on Las Vegas music festival – excess of 100 were injured when a ‘lone wolf’ gunman fire multiple shots at the Route 91 harvest country. There was a shooter on 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay. She is an Asian female, approximately 4ft 11in, weight of 111lbs. There are of course saying there was a female asian companion from many sources. Stay tuned for more info from BIN on this tragic situation.

They were pointing to the 32nd floor and saying, “there he is, half way up the building”.  I’ll take credible eye witnesses over click-bait any day.\nExcept…witnesses saw three Bigfeets being chased by hotel security in the Luxor.  One of the Bigfeets had on a security jacket just like he was a worker at the Luxor.  We HAVE to get to the bottom of the Bigfeets, they are the key.\nOct 3, 2017, 9:15 am\nCLICK HERE TO UPLOAD NEWS!\n\"Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the  Lord of hosts.\"  Zechariah 4:6\nRead it..\nSubmit\nTop Global\nPortions copyright © 2019 NSearch Technology, Inc., All Rights Reserved.\nBefore It's News® is a registered Service Mark of NSearch Technology,     Inc..\nLooks like you’re using an ad-blocker.\nThis site is supported by ads.
