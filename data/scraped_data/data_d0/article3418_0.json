        "text": "Hot Topics\nNew Video Emerges Raising Questions of Overlapping Gunfire at Las Vegas Concert\nA new video has emerged from the night of the Las Vegas shooting that appears to show overlapping gunfire coming from multiple locations, which clearly contradicts the mainstream narrative of what occurred on the night 59 people were killed and over 500 were injured.\nThe video is under 3 minutes long and was filmed by an individual who appears to be hiding near a gate during the shooting. While crowds of people can be seen running from the area, the person filming the video is staying low to the ground with a group of people who are encouraging others to take cover, instead of running out into the open.\n“No, we are NOT moving. Just stay down,” one girl says. “Don’t leave, just stay down!”\nThe first burst of gunfire can be heard at the 0:15 mark, followed almost immediately by a second burst of gunfire that sounds distinctly different. The same thing happens again at the 2:01 mark, with secondary gunfire beginning at the 2:06 mark.\nIt is important to note that while this video does appear to confirm multiple shooters, there are a number of varying scenarios that could’ve produced these effects. The acoustics in a massive concrete city like Las Vegas can certainly play tricks on even the most astute audiophiles.\nWhile this is not exactly a smoking gun, this video certainly warrants further investigation and should not be overlooked. However, it appears that the mainstream media and police, at least publicly, have no concern with this evidence.\nThis is not the first evidence of the massacre being carried out by multiple shooters. In fact, video surfaced on Tuesday from a taxi driver who distinctly heard gunfire from two different locations.\nWhile sitting in the taxi line at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, Cori Langdon began recording as soon she heard gunshots ring out. Her video begins with the sounds of distant shooting and within seconds, the shooting the gunfire sounds as if it is coming from a different, closer location.\nAs The Free Thought Project reported ,\nWhile there were two windows busted out of Paddock’s dual room suite, the distance between them does not seem far enough away from each other to produce the sounds we hear in the video below. Also, it would have been quite the feat to run between both windows as fast as the firing is heard. Some of the exchanges happen almost instantly.\nOne week after the Las Vegas shooting, there remain a number of glaring inconsistencies that contradict the official narrative. In addition to refusing to acknowledge the growing number of witness accounts that have claimed there were multiple shooters, it took the FBI less than 24 hours to pin the entire shooting on one suspect.\nThis suspect, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, apparently defied the odds by carrying out what is being called the “deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. History” with incredible proficiency, using advanced weapons, even though he has no military background, and he did not have a reputation as a “gun guy.” The idea that the FBI would not be asking the obvious questions about whether other shooters were involved, is completely absurd.\nWhile some body camera footage has been released from the night of the shooting that gives insight into the chaotic scene from the firsthand perspective of the police officers involved, there is one incredibly important piece of video evidence that has yet to be released.\nAccording to the FBI’s official narrative, Paddock acted alone, which means that he was responsible for transporting dozens of rifles, thousands of rounds of ammunition and various other supplies up to his hotel room in the days before the shooting. Luckily, he was in one of the most popular hotels in Las Vegas, which means that there should be plenty of security camera footage showing him with his luggage—yet none of it has been released.\nIn fact, less than 24 hours after the shooting occurred, NBC News published a story featuring various photos from security cameras that appeared to show Stephen Paddock at a casino in the Cosmopolitan Hotel, and then in an Emergency room after he fell in 2011. It took just hours to find security footage of Paddock from 6 years ago, but it has been over a week, and the footage from 2 days before the shooting still has not been released?\nThe latest video evidence makes it hard to deny that there were, in fact, multiple shooters. The idea that the FBI refuses to acknowledge the witness testimonies—even with increasing evidence—raises serious questions about the possibility of their agents’ contribution to the massacre.\nRachel Blevins is a Texas-based journalist who aspires to break the left/right paradigm in media and politics by pursuing truth and questioning existing narratives.

Cui bono?  After each mass murder, the NRA promotes the lie that the government is coming to take your guns and that we need more guns, not fewer…..to promote gun sales,which skyrocket.\nThe day after this atrocity, gun makers stocks rose 3-4% as specuators anticipated increased gun sales.  Who is responsible?  Cui bono?\nI am not a people but an independent scholar and reporter.   The NRA was founded in 1871 to teach markenship and untl just recently  joined   the fight for gun control.\n“The NRA formed its Legislative Affairs Division to update members with facts and analysis of upcoming bills,[29] after the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) became the first federal gun-control law passed in the U.S.[30] Karl Frederick, NRA President in 1934, during congressional NFA hearings testified “I have never believed in the general practice of carrying weapons. I seldom carry one. … I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns. I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses.”[31] The NRA supported the NFA along with the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), which together created a system to federally license gun dealers and established restrictions on particular categories and classes of firearms” Wikipedia (with primary sources)\nI agree that their long history of supporting gun control is patriotic  It is NOT the oldest patriotic organization.  Such organizations go back to the American Revolution: “The Daughters of Liberty signifies the formal women Patriot association that was formed in 1765 to protest the Stamp Act and later the Townshend Acts, as well as a general term for women who identified themselves as fighting for liberty during the American Revolution”\nHere is a list ohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Patriotic_societiesf older patriotic organizations;\nBloomberg.com documented the surge in gun sales based on fear that gun control would follow, in “After Orlando, Gun Sales Surged….with graphs showing a pattern of gun sales soaring after each mass shooting and the NRA warning that the gun control lobby was trying to restrict guns.\nGun-maker stocks rally after mass shooting in Las Vegas – MarketWatch\nThe NRA was founded not as a “patriotic” organization but rather”The N.R.A. was founded in 1871 by a group of former Union Army officers dismayed that so many Northern soldiers, often poorly trained, had been scarcely capable of using their weapons.” http://time.com/4106381/nra-1871-history/\nIn more recent years the NRA which once was at the forefront of promoting gun regulation  has become a voice for the gun makers, using its clout to increase gun sales by promoting the narrative that the government is prepared to limit gun purchases.\nThat is a simple fact, well-documented, not contortion.\nThe purpose of the NRA was to teach markmanship so that those drafted or enisting in the miitary had the necessary skills.  Skills are not patriotism, which consists of an attachment to ones homeland.    By 1871, there was no militia but a large standing army.  Article 1 Section 8 says Congress has the power to call forth, organize, arm, and discipline the militia, so until it is called forth, organize, and armed by Congress, it is just an available pool of potential draftees.    The NRA wanted to make sure that those in the military could should straight.\ni note that you accuse me of ignoring facts but you totally ignore the correction to your claim the NRA is the oldest patriotic organization in the country.\nGun control in all other 34 advanced nations has reduced gun violence to 85-99.9% lower than in the US.  It is blatantly absurd to claim it does not stop violence. No other developed nation has either the gun murder rate or the mass murders as the US, and all have strong, restrictive gun rights.\nGun laws work in all other high income nations. The comparison with drug laws is not valid because your logic is that guns are addictive.  Are they?\nThat make no sense!  The solution comes out within hours, and the agenda was security, scanners, more po-po, and less gun rights (oh no! “Putin did it with a Bump Stock” propaganda from all of the MSM propagandists)\nDude! You’re either stupid, a stupid libtard, or a paid disinfo shill!\nYour insults are a sad reflection on your character.\nI take it you don’t like the facts I have presented.\nHere is documentation: “”The NRA formed its Legislative Affairs Division to update members with facts and analysis of upcoming bills,[29] after the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) became the first federal gun-control law passed in the U.S.[30] Karl Frederick, NRA President in 1934, during congressional NFA hearings testified “I have never believed in the general practice of carrying weapons.

His brother who admits he had little contact with Paddock says ” He was not an avid guy guy,’ but a friend who knew him well refutes this account by a brother who had hardly seen him .\n“Their acquaintanceship, through more than half a dozen encounters in the US and the Philippines between 2013 and 2015, revealed Paddock’s generosity – which had his overseas guests living in “palatial” style – and the existence of a “gun room” at his home in Mesquite, Nevada…It was on that first stay in Mesquite that Paddock gestured in passing to his “gun room”. Its presence in the two bedroom home left  an impression on the man – who opposes the US’s lax gun laws – but he “didn’t pursue it” with Paddock.\n“His comments were that it’s a substantial hobby that needs to be protected: ‘a gun room’,” the man said.”\nis this article just shoddy journalism or fake news/ or is it propaganda designed to boost gun sales?\nSaint Howard is correct. The sound that begins at the 2:01 point is of a rifle fired via bump stock in area away from the camera. At the 2:06 mark the rounds are sprayed in the direction of the camera and pass nearby. Thus, the sound changes since the camera records the sound that bullets make as the pass nearby at supersonic speeds. The sharper “crack” sound is what it sounds like when someone is shooting at/near you and the bullet whizzes by making that sharp sound. The rate of fire is too slow and erratic to be from an automatic firearm.\nThere is a report of a woman who said on Savage Nation that she was with a lady who was shot in the stomach when her right shoulder was turned toward the Mandalay (which meant that the stomach wound came from a direction 90 degrees away from the sniper’s line of fire). Her statement indicates a second shooter. Also there is a man who was shot and says his shooter shot him in the pelvis from ground level. So there is some eye witness indication of a second shooter.\nOf singular importance is the lady cab driver’s video which shows her leaving the hotel just as a burst starts. You can see the muzzle flash from what looks like a more centered third or fourth floor window, far below the upper right of the hotel where the sniper’s nest was found. The flashes are in synch with the sound of the firing since she was not more than 100 yards from the flashes.\nI/ think that proper forensics dictates finding as many of the bullets as can be located and matching them to each weapon found in the sniper’s nest.\nIf the police/feds find rounds fired by other weapons, not seized from the sniper’s nest,…..well then we have absolute proof of a second shooter !\nby  Robert Higgs, 2005\nSince love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved. – Niccolò Machiavelli, The Prince, 1513\n.\nAn amateur writes down H/D triangulation notes from laser measurement scopes before the shooting?
