But as Clinton said, it hasn’t been “quite that long.” In 1986, Clinton was Arkansas first lady, and her involvement on trade policy would have been limited at best. Her first major role in national politics was as First Lady, when former President Bill Clinton won his first presidential race in 1992.\n",
