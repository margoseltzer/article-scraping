Add your two cents.\nFrom Al Case at Matrix Martial Arts…\nNewsletter 894\nCongrats to Shayne Guthrie.\nMeijin Al,\nI found that if you do the material while concentrating on the basic basics and the Master Instructor course, your form and understanding are greatly enhanced and makes the material easily understood.\nI dedicated the last 7 yrs to studying everything that you have written and I chose the Temple Karate program, with your entire Monkey Boxing course, simply because everything you teach, is in these personal system of yours. The Karate, the Shaolin, the Pau Kua and the Tai Chi.\nI believe the forms were good due to these two courses. The 40 monkeys really showed and allowed the bridge to be seen from application to actual combat. And, the temple forms, in the way that you structured them just made the Karate I learned in my 20’s make more sense. An example is the second movement in Pinan 3, where the double block ends, in the classical movement, you expanded that motion with a step slap grab motion…which when I was first learning it I always thought there should be something else. This is one of the reasons that I decided on Temple Karate, it was here that I knew I had found a True Art.\nThank you and I hope you do not mind me addressing you as Meijin…I have a friend who is fluent in Japanese ( a fellow MA) and I was discussing some of your teachings and he commented Meijin and when I asked him what that meant he said this:\nMeijin Literally â€œbrilliant  man,â€ a rarely used title for only the oldest, most dedicated and most skilled of instructors in a system.  The title carries with it a  sense of genius in the martial arts, and may also imply attainment of a high spiritual level.\nI thought it described you very well!\nA Humble Bow Meijin\nTo be called Meijin,\nI don’t think anybody has ever said that before,\nso I thank you,\nAnd,\nproceeds through the kung fu courses,\ngoes into Monkey Boxing.\nThe fact is,\nuntil you have done that first matrixing course.\nthen it opens up,\nThat is the intent of Temple Karate.\nHereâ€™s the link.\nGoogle doesnâ€™t like newsletters,\nso this is the best way to ensure you get them.\nYou can find all my books here!\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
