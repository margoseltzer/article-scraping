He attended alongside former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was injured in a mass shooting in 2011, as well as Giffords's husband astronaut Mark Kelly and Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).\nStory Continued Below\n\"The thing that's painful about this: this is a weird thing to say but I always hoped that Virginia Tech would be the worst one ever,\" Kaine told reporters after a quiet, 10-minute visit to the site. \"As bad as that was, I hoped nothing would ever eclipse it. But such is life. We got work to do.\"\nKaine was Virginia's governor in 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people at the university.\nLater Monday, Kaine, Giffords and Kelly are scheduled to attend a presidential debate watch party with LGBT activists here in Orlando.\nKaine's running mate, Hillary Clinton, visited Pulse in July.\nPolitico Magazine\nBy Austin Sarat and Jonathan Obert\n",
