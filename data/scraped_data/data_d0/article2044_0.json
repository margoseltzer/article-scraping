Add your two cents.\nBetting on CS GO with Bitcoin\nOnline gambling can go two ways: it can either be extremely safe or become very risky. It all depends on the laws of the country or state that you reside in. Some countries don’t care about where you’re putting your money while others may just throw you in jail simply because you bet a penny on a Counter Strike GO match.\nTake, for instance, the United States. Since gambling is outlawed, most people might prefer turning to the privacy offered by Bitcoin rather than going for traditional currency.\nWhat Is Bitcoin?\nBitcoin is basically money that you buy with money. Since it works pretty much as if you just bought something online from whatever website, how you use the product should be of no concern to anyone. As a result, you could use the bitcoins for esports Bitcoin betting .\nHowever, it’s still tricky. Law enforcement learned this trick and is sometimes “stalking” for Bitcoin users as well. Traditional or online, bitcoins are still coins – and therefore, it’s still considered money. As a result, you may sometimes have to download the betting software to evade any prying eyes.\nWhy Go for Bitcoins When Playing CS GO?\nThere are many advantages to using Bitcoin in eSport betting. A Bitcoin gaming website, for instance, is much faster. When you use traditional currencies, most of the time you’d have to wreck your nerves to make the payment official. Introduce your details, get your acceptance, make your transaction, ensure that it’s legal; this may be just enough to make you lose interest in the betting session and miss the match in the meantime.\nWith bitcoin, however, you will only have to sign up using your email address. You will rarely find any other transaction processing fees, which means that the whole ordeal will be done rather quickly.\nFurthermore, if it’s not legal in your country – you can make it legal. The wonderful thing about the Internet is the fact that it spreads worldwide – and that includes countries where online gambling is not considered an issue.\nAs a result, you may be a US player struggling with the laws of your state – but you could still be accepted on an outer website that allows players from the US. Since the website is not based on US grounds, you may not be bound by the law.\nHere’s the kicker: if you used the traditional money, making the transaction would be all the more troublesome – you’d either have to make the conversion or hide from the law enforcement the fact that you’re betting on a game using your bank account. With bitcoin, however, most problems are done with. Bitcoins represent universal gaming currency – so regardless of the country, you won’t have to go through many struggles. It’s the same money, but less of a headache.\nWinning CS GO Skins\nWhy do we bet during our Counter Strike GO game plays? It’s quite simple. We never really bet because we want to cash in the money and use it in real life; we bet because we want to use that money in the virtual world. We want to buy the skins and weapons necessary to win the tournaments that CS GO launches from time to time.\nWell, some betting websites want to make things even simpler for us. Instead of playing for money, you are playing for skins. They may only look fashionable and fancy, but they are great help when it comes to protecting your hero in a CS GO gameplay.\nThese skins are also valuable in the real world. You can trade them for all you want – cash or bitcoins. The choice of how you use the winnings is pretty much yours. We bet on CS G O because we want to be the winners – so no matter if you use the prize to pimp your hero or pay your bread, you have all the freedom. eSport betting is convenient this way.\nWe are all gamblers – at least to some extent. If we don’t take the risk, we don’t win. Even when your take your hero in CS GO to some dark tavern, you take a risk – you have no idea who might creep up on you and end your game.\nWhen you are betting with Bitcoin, there’s still some risk – but the focus is on the risk of losing the bet rather than the risk of getting caught and thrown in jail. It’s a method that is supposed to make your gaming experience a little more enjoyable – and less stressful. It will be lucrative and entertaining at the same time and, if you are lucky, it will also be rewarding.
