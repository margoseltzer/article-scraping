        "text": "While Donald Trump will top expectations, Hillary Clinton’s challenge in Monday night’s debate is to become human, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said Monday.\n“What Hillary Clinton has to do here is she has to become human, and I mean that in a good way,” Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still getting severance from the Trump campaign, said Monday morning during a panel discussion. “She has to connect with people because I think what happens is people see her as — look, she knows the issues. There’s no question about that, but what she doesn’t have is that compassion that people see, and I think if she’s gonna be successful tonight, she has to relate to people on a different level, and the expectation of Donald Trump as not preparing, I think he’ll exceed that expectation.”\nStory Continued Below\nLewandowski pushed back on the notion that Trump won’t be prepared for his prime-time faceoff with Clinton at Hofstra University in New York, noting that a similar narrative of an ill-prepared Trump played out during the Republican primary debates, yet the real estate mogul was actually “very prepared” and “dominated” his rivals.\n“Look, I think it’s the same preparation that he’s using now,” Lewandowski said of Trump’s primary debate prep, “which is conversation, talking with experts in their respective fields, understanding the issues, making sure he’s got briefing documents on issues that he wants to know more about, but he’s also prepared for the last 40 years of his life, and, you know, getting ready for a day like this is a big day for anybody. You got 100 million people, potentially, who are gonna tune in, and one of the next two people who’s gonna be president of the United States is gonna be standing on that stage tonight. I think it’s a big day for everybody.”\nPolitico Magazine\nBy Austin Sarat and Jonathan Obert\n",
