This figure trailed Clinton’s fundraising figures by $42 million.\nTrump's touting of fundraising marks a shift from Trump's primary strategy, where he touted himself as a candidate who, unlike his rivals, would not be beholden to donors. In the general election, however, Trump has shattered Republican records for fundraising from small donors .\nPolitico Magazine\nBy Austin Sarat and Jonathan Obert\n",
