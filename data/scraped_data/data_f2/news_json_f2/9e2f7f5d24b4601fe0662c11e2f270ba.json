        "text": "(Natural News) The climate change hoax has collapsed. A devastating series of research papers has just been published, revealing that human activity can account for no more than a .01°C rise in global temperatures, meaning that all the human activity targeted by radical climate change alarmists — combustion engines, airplane flights, diesel tractors — has virtually no measurable impact on the temperature of the planet.\n\nFinnish scientists spearheaded the research, releasing a paper entitled, “No Experimental Evidence for the Significant Anthropogenic Climate Change.”\n\nThe paper explains that IPCC analysis of global temperatures suffers from a glaring error — namely, failure to account for “influences of low cloud cover” and how it impacts global temperatures. Natural variations in low cloud cover, which are strongly influenced by cosmic radiation’s ability to penetrate Earth’s atmosphere due to variations in the strength of our planet’s magnetosphere, account for nearly all changes in global temperature, the researchers explain.\n\nAs this chart reveals, more cloud cover is inversely related to temperature. In other words, clouds shield the surface of the Earth from the sun, providing shade cover cooling, while a lack of clouds results in more warming:\n\nCloud cover accounts for the real changes in global temperatures\n\nThis is further supported by researchers at Kobe University in Japan who published a nearly simultaneous paper that reveals how changes in our planet’s magnetic field govern the intensity of solar radiation that reaches the lower atmosphere, causing cloud formation that alters global temperatures.\n\nSupport our mission and enhance your own self-reliance: The laboratory-verified Organic Emergency Survival Bucket provides certified organic, high-nutrition storable food for emergency preparedness.

Learn more at the Health Ranger Store.\n\nThat study, published in Nature, is called, “Intensified East Asian winter monsoon during the last geomagnetic reversal transition.” It states:\n\nRecords of suborbital-scale climate variation during the last glacial and Holocene periods can be used to elucidate the mechanisms of rapid climate changes… At least one event was associated with a decrease in the strength of the Earth’s magnetic field. Thus, climate records from the MIS 19 interglacial can be used to elucidate the mechanisms of a variety of climate changes, including testing the effect of changes in geomagnetic dipole field strength on climate through galactic cosmic ray (GCR)-induced cloud formation…\n\nIn effect, cosmic rays which are normally deflected via the magnetosphere are, in times of weak or changing magnetic fields emanating from Earth itself, able to penetrate further into Earth’s atmosphere, causing the formation of low-level clouds which cover the land in a kind of “umbrella effect” that shades the land from the sun, allowing cooling to take place. But a lack of clouds makes the surface hotter, as would be expected. This natural phenomenon is now documented to be the primary driver of global temperatures and climate, not human activity.\n\nBurn all the oil you want, in other words, and it’s still just a drop in the bucket compared to the power of the sun and other cosmic influences. All the fossil fuel consumption in the world barely contributes anything to actual global temperatures, the researchers confirmed.\n\nAs they explain, the IPCC’s climate models are wildly overestimating the influence of carbon dioxide on global temperatures:\n\n…the [IPCC] models fail to derive the influences of low cloud cover fraction on the global temperature. A too small natural component results in a too large portion for the contribution of the greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. That is why J. KAUPPINEN AND P. MALMI IPCC represents the climate sensitivity more than one order of magnitude larger than our sensitivity 0.24°C. Because the anthropogenic portion in the increased CO2 is less than 10%, we have practically no anthropogenic climate change. The low clouds control mainly the global temperature.\n\nThe entire “climate change” hoax is a fraud\n\nCarbon dioxide, in other words, isn’t the “pollutant” that climate change alarmists have long claimed it to be. CO2 won’t destroy the planet and barely has any effect on global temperatures (the IPCC’s estimate of its effect is, according to Finnish researchers, about one order of magnitude too large, or ten times the actual amount).\n\nIn fact, NASA was forced to recently admit that carbon dioxide is re-greening the Earth on a massive scale by supporting the growth of rainforests, trees and grasslands. See these maps showing the increase in green plant life, thanks to rising CO2:\n\nImportantly, reducing our global consumption of fossil fuels will have virtually no impact on global temperatures. The far bigger governor of climate and temperatures is the strength and configuration of Earth’s magnetosphere, which has always been in flux since the formation of the planet billions of years ago. The weaker the magnetosphere, the more cosmic rays penetrate the atmosphere, resulting in the generation of clouds, which shield the planet’s surface from the sun. Thus, a weaker magnetosphere causes global cooling, while a stronger magnetosphere results in global warming, according to this research. This phenomenon is called the “Svensmark Effect.”\n\nAs reported by Science Daily:\n\nThis suggests that the increase in cosmic rays was accompanied by an increase in low-cloud cover, the umbrella effect of the clouds cooled the continent, and Siberian high atmospheric pressure became stronger. Added to other phenomena during the geomagnetic reversal — evidence of an annual average temperature drop of 2-3 degrees Celsius, and an increase in annual temperature ranges from the sediment in Osaka Bay — this new discovery about winter monsoons provides further proof that the climate changes are caused by the cloud umbrella effect.\n\nThe “war on carbon” is derived from sheer stupidity, arrogance and scientific illiteracy\n\nThe extreme alarmism of climate change lunatics — best personified by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’ insistence that humanity will be destroyed in 12 years if we don’t stop burning fossil fuels — is all based on nothing but fearmongering media propaganda and faked science. (The IPCC and NOAA both routinely fudge temperature data to try to create a warming “trend” where none exists.)\n\nIt’s all a massive, coordinated fraud, and the mainstream media deliberately lies to the public about climate change to push anti-free market schemes that would destroy the U.S. economy while transferring literally trillions of dollars into the pockets of wealthy globalists as part of a “carbon tax” scheme.\n\nYet carbon isn’t the problem at all. And the “war on carbon” is a stupid, senseless policy created by idiots, given that humans are carbon-based lifeforms, meaning that any “war on carbon” is a war on humanity.\n\nSee more research papers from Jyrki Kauppinen at this link on Researchgate.net.

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "NASA declares carbon dioxide is GREENING the Earth… reveals how Green New Death is a DEATH cult that would collapse global ecology\n\nIn direct contradiction to the scare stories about carbon dioxide being relentlessly pushed by the climate change alarmists, a scientific study published in Nature Climate Change and highlighted by NASA reveals that rising carbon dioxide levels are having a tremendously positive impact on the re-greening of planet Earth over the last three decades, with some regions experiencing over a 50% increase in plant life.\n\nThe study, entitled, “Greening of the Earth and its drivers,” used satellite data to track and map the expansion of green plant growth across the globe from 1982 – 2015. Published in 2016, this study found that rising atmospheric carbon dioxide causes “fertilization” of plant life, resulting in a remarkable acceleration of increased “greening” across every Earth continent. As the study abstract explains:\n\nWe show a persistent and widespread increase of growing season integrated LAI (greening) over 25% to 50% of the global vegetated area… Factorial simulations with multiple global ecosystem models suggest that CO2 fertilization effects explain 70% of the observed greening trend…\n\nIn other words, the planet is getting greener, and we have rising CO2 levels to thank for it, since rising CO2 accounts for about 70% of the increase in planet-wide greening, according to scientists. The more CO2 we release into the atmosphere, the more nutrients are available for plants, and the more rapidly the Earth is re-greened.\n\nThe following compilation map shows which land masses have experienced expanded greening since 1982. As the legend explains, the light green areas represent a 25% increase in green plants, and the dark green areas represent a 50% or greater increase:\n\nSupport our mission and protect your health: Organic Seeds of Life combines Red Raspberry Seed Power, Black Cumin Seed Power and Red Grape Seed Powder into the most potent nutrient-rich supplemental superfood powder you've ever experienced.

Myeneni\n\nNatural News readers may note this is exactly what we’ve been reporting for over a decade. It’s basic science, of course, since plants use carbon dioxide to thrive. Higher CO2 means a greener Earth, since CO2 is the single most important molecule for sustaining plant life across the globe. It is beyond astonishing that the entire climate change cult denies the basic science of botany and photosynthesis.\n\nRead my 2017 article which covers all this: All the biggest lies about climate change and global warming DEBUNKED in one astonishing interview.\n\nNASA confirms the findings and even publishes a video touting the increase in global greening due to rising CO2\n\nTo the shock of many climate change alarmists, even NASA scientists confirmed that carbon dioxide is “greening” the planet. As stated on the NASA.gov website in an article titled, “Carbon Dioxide Fertilization Greening Earth, Study Finds“:\n\nFrom a quarter to half of Earth’s vegetated lands has shown significant greening over the last 35 years largely due to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change on April 25.\n\nAn international team of 32 authors from 24 institutions in eight countries led the effort, which involved using satellite data from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer instruments to help determine the leaf area index, or amount of leaf cover, over the planet’s vegetated regions. The greening represents an increase in leaves on plants and trees equivalent in area to two times the continental United States.\n\nNASA explains almost exactly what I’ve been explaining for the last several years: That carbon dioxide is a necessary component of photosynthesis, the biochemical process by which plants produce metabolic energy. Via NASA:\n\nGreen leaves use energy from sunlight through photosynthesis to chemically combine carbon dioxide drawn in from the air with water and nutrients tapped from the ground to produce sugars, which are the main source of food, fiber and fuel for life on Earth. Studies have shown that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide increase photosynthesis, spurring plant growth.\n\nResults showed that carbon dioxide fertilization explains 70 percent of the greening effect, said co-author Ranga Myneni, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environment at Boston University.\n\nNASA even released a YouTube video that almost exactly mirrors the message Natural News has been advocating for years. The video is entitled, “Rising CO2 levels greening Earth”:\n\nWhy the Green New Deal would KILL the greening of the Earth\n\nIn direct contradiction to the real science on the greening benefits of carbon dioxide, Democrats routinely and mindlessly claim that carbon dioxide is a poisonous “pollutant” that will destroy the world. The anti-knowledge of lunatic Democrats demonstrates the extreme dangers of those who are scientifically illiterate yet spout “science” as their justification for demanding radical interventions in atmospheric chemistry.\n\nIn truth, rising levels of carbon dioxide will cause the following beneficial effects on Earth:\n\nReforestation due to Earth moving toward a warmer, wetter, more greenhouse-like environment\n\nAcceleration of food production among food crops\n\nAn increase in the biodiversity of rainforests\n\nIncreased rainfall across Earth’s continents\n\nThe transformation of deserts into usable plains for grazing and agriculture\n\nThe acceleration of the greening of the planet, which is already far greener than it was 50 years ago\n\nThere are virtually no Democrats who recognize that carbon dioxide is the “miracle molecule” for plant life. “Green New Deal” proponents like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — who is scientifically and economically illiterate — think that carbon dioxide must be eliminated in order to save the planet. In fact, she warns that Earth only has 12 years to go before all life ceases to exist unless humans stop burning fossil fuels.\n\nNot surprisingly, she has it all wrong: It’s the burning of fossil fuels that’s releasing beneficial CO2 into the atmosphere, causing the global greening that NASA has already confirmed (see above). If humans stop burning fossil fuels, the result would decrease atmospheric CO2, resulting in plants starving to death from lack of CO2.\n\nThis would, of course, lead to the mass global die-off of trees, grasslands, food crops and rainforests. The “Green New Deal,” in other words, would actually result in the mass killing of plant life across the entire planet. If the world were to follow the demands of Ocasio-Cortez, the world’s ecosystems would collapse, resulting in mass death of plants, animals and humans.\n\nThe Green New Deal is a “Death Cult”\n\nIt turns out that climate change alarmists, by vilifying CO2, are demanding actions that would make the planet less green by killing plants everywhere. Instead of a warm, wet planet with abundant rainfall and rainforests, Democrat seem to want a cold, dead world that’s devoid of plant life.\n\nAs any competent scientist would openly admit, the elimination of CO2 from the atmosphere would collapse the global ecosystem, leading to the complete wipe out of nearly all plants, animals and humans. Those who are calling for the elimination of CO2 are, as I have previously warned, actually advocating the terraforming of planet Earth into a post-human, post-life status that would collapse human civilization and annihilate nearly all food webs around the world.\n\nAs reported by Natural News, AOC’s “Green New Deal” seeks to eliminate the very molecule that turns planets green: Carbon dioxide, the molecule of life.\n\nPeople like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are not the saviors of the planet, it turns out: They are the death merchants who threaten to destroy all life as we know it. Carbon dioxide isn’t a threat to planet Earth, but people like Ocasio-Cortez surely are. If anything should be eliminated from the atmosphere, it’s the hot air coming from the mouths of the climate alarmists who are spewing their death cult quackery that would devastate our planet if deployed.\n\nIf you really want to “green” the planet, stop the climate change lunatics like Ocasio-Cortez whose proposals would quite literally murder nearly all life on planet Earth.\n\nSimply put:\n\nMore carbon dioxide = more green plants\n\nThat’s why CO2 is called a “greenhouse gas.” It turns the planet into a lush, plant-filled greenhouse that’s warmer, wetter and more abundant across all plant life. Why don’t Democrats and Leftists want Earth to be more green?\n\nStay informed. Read Climate.news for frequent updates.",

        "text": "(Natural News) The widely-touted “Green New Deal,” aggressively pushed by AOC and radical left-wing Democrats, demands ending reliance on fossil fuels in ten years. All combustion engines must go, the plan insists, and “clean” energy sources such as wind and solar must replace them in order to save the planet from total destruction that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims will take place in 12 years (unless we surrender to the climate change cultists).\n\nIn pushing this plan, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appears to be either economically illiterate or intending to unleash mass starvation and suffering across the nation. Does she not realize there is no such thing as wind-powered farm tractors or solar-powered long haul big rig trucks? There are no battery-powered commercial jet airliners, either, and the entire infrastructure for agriculture depends almost entirely on heavy equipment that runs on combustion engines.\n\nThe simple, undeniable truth of the matter is that batteries simply don’t come anywhere close to the energy density of fossil fuels. Large agriculture tractors run on diesel fuel because diesel packs an astonishing amount of work energy into a small amount of volume and weight of fuel. Airplanes run on jet fuel for the same reason. Long haul transport trucks run on diesel because the portability of the liquid fuel provides torque and range, allowing trucks to drive many hundreds of miles between fuel stops, even when hauling tens of thousands of pounds of consumable products.\n\nIn fact, a 100 horsepower tractor — a common size for a farm tractor — would need to be outfitted with nearly 5000 square feet of solar panels to equal the power of a single 100 h.p. diesel engine. That’s a solar array of roughly 70′ x 70′, mounted to a tractor.\n\nHere’s the math: 1 horsepower = 746 watts, so 100 h.p. is 74,600 watts. Each square foot of solar panels produces roughly 15 watts of power, so you would need 4,973 square feet of solar panels, which comes to an array of about 70′ x 70′.\n\nSuch a tractor would be impossible to maneuver and would stop operating when the sun isn’t shining. It would fall over at the slightest incline, and would be blown away by the slightest wind. The 70′ square solar array would make the tractor impossible to transport on a truck, park in a barn or even moved into a repair shop. The very idea is sheer insanity.\n\nIt is upon these insane, ludicrous dreamworld concepts that AOC’s Green New Deal is ultimately based. Anyone who’s going to insist that all combustion engines be eliminated in ten years might as well also say that Leprechauns will deliver pots of gold at the end of every rainbow, or that new batteries will run on magic. This is what the Democrats have come to: Sheer insanity disguised as policy.\n\nShutting down fossil fuels would collapse the U.S. food supply and lead to mass starvation\n\nNatural News has conducted a straightforward analysis of the agricultural use of fossil fuels and how the food production industry would be impacted by ending the use of fossil fuels in the next decade. A detailed infographic, shown below, summarizes these important findings.\n\nWhat we’ve found should be alarming for anyone paying attention to reality. Here are the main points:\n\nThe agricultural industry depends heavily on fossil fuels for farming, harvesting, milling, manufacturing, transport and even for fertilizers. (See statistics in the infographic, below.)\n\nFood imports depend almost entirely on fossil fuel-powered ships, shipping port transport equipment (such as cranes and forklifts), long haul rigs and other heavy equipment that run almost exclusively on fossil fuels.\n\nThere are no “green energy” replacements capable of powering most of the heavy equipment used in food production, manufacturing and transportation, aside from small, battery-powered forklifts that must be recharged for many hours between uses. (There are no battery-powered ocean freighter ships that can cross the Pacific Ocean on battery power, for example. They simply do not exist.)\n\ncapable of powering most of the heavy equipment used in food production, manufacturing and transportation, aside from small, battery-powered forklifts that must be recharged for many hours between uses. (There are no battery-powered ocean freighter ships that can cross the Pacific Ocean on battery power, for example. They simply do not exist.) Ending fossil fuels and combustion engines would result in a catastrophic collapse of national food production.\n\nof national food production. Our rough estimate is that food supplies would collapse by 80% within the first 12 months after fossil fuels are outlawed.\n\nThe result would be mass starvation, social chaos, uncontrolled outbreaks of infectious disease, a collapse of government, widespread mayhem and lawlessness.\n\nUnder the scenario, the GDP of the United State of America would plummet by an estimated 70% as the national economy grinds to a halt.\n\nAmerica would cease to exist as a nation and would be especially vulnerable to invasions by foreign forces such as China, Russia or even migrant waves of military-aged men from Central and South America. (Is this what Ocasio-Cortez wants to see happen?)\n\nIn summary, the “Green New Deal” appears to be a planned, engineered economic apocalypse plot to destroy America from within. No wonder so many Democrats have signed onto the plan, for it is exactly what they want to see happen: the complete economic destruction of the United States of America.\n\nThe Green New Deal might be more accurately called “the 1700s” because it would thrust America back to the age before engines and machines, forcing the nation to live in an era utterly lacking in modern machines that produce and transport the food supply.\n\nSee the full Infographic here… and share everywhere\n\nYou can also view a larger version of the following infographic at this link:\n\nFinal thought: Combustion engines actually release the CO2 needed by food crops\n\nIt’s also worth noting in all this that combustion engines release carbon dioxide, the very “miracle molecule” needed by plants to grow and produce food. CO2 is essential to photosynthesis, and by burning fossil fuels, heavy machines actually release carbon that has been sequestered in the Earth. Higher CO2 levels in the atmosphere accelerate food crop production and even allow arid regions of the world to produce more food. This is why greenhouses frequently buy and operate CO2 generators to increase the CO2 in the greenhouse air, accelerating plant growth.\n\nThus, the very fossil fuel-powered machines that harvest the food also release food-producing nutrients as they are operated. This is an indisputable scientific fact. There’s even a non-profit group called the CO2 Coalition that publishes white papers talking about the simple science behind CO2. (The group is probably funded by the energy industry, but that doesn’t mean their information is wrong.)\n\nCarbon dioxide is such an important molecule for all life on Earth that I’m now calling it the “God molecule.” Yet climate change cultists call CO2 a “pollutant,” completely oblivious to the crucial role this molecule plays in all plant life on our planet (and nearly all food webs that support animals and humans).\n\nAlthough combustion engines can release particulate pollutants, that is almost entirely eliminated through emissions controls. Newer diesel engines even use ammonia solutions to produce near-zero emissions, and all the agricultural, construction and transportation equipment sold today must adhere to these stringent emissions controls. I know this because I own modern John Deere equipment, and the emissions are so clean that you can now literally stand right behind the exhaust of a diesel-powered machine and breathe normally. It’s not like the old ways when diesel engines spewed dark clouds of toxic pollutants.\n\nSolar power and wind power have their place and can be very effective at powering homes and businesses that are connected to the grid, but “green” energy sources are incredibly bad at powering machines which are not connected to the grid. That’s why the Green New Deal is a pipe dream authored by some of the most incredibly stupid, scientifically illiterate people on the planet.\n\nWatch my video on carbon dioxide to learn more, via Brighteon.com:\n\nBrighteon.com/5820639339001\n\nAlso see more details on fossil fuels consumption by the agriculture sector at:\n\nhttps://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=18431#",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites.

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively.

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai.

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model.

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5.

        "text": "Fine–ultrafine-grained magnetic particles neoformed by pedogenesis cause an increase in loess magnetic susceptibility (χ) and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility (χ FD )44. Therefore, χ and χ FD are suitable proxies for SM strength (especially summer precipitation). Modern dust storms occur mainly in the spring in China, but the frequency is correlated positively with that of cold surges in the winter, a proxy for the strength of the WM45. Therefore, the strength of the preceding WM conditions dust storms. Hence, the grain size of dust reflects the strength of a winter north–northwesterly wind and is suitable as a WM proxy. Orbital-scale variations in χ (or χ FD ) and the median grain size of loess show inverse correlations, both consistent with marine oxygen isotope changes10,23.\n\nThe acquisition of high-resolution records for the East-Asian monsoon proxies, χ, χ FD , and grain size, was essential for this study. We collected loess-paleosol samples from two 7.0–7.7-m-thick parallel sections in Xifeng (35.45°N, 107.49°E) and Lingtai (35.04°N, 107.39°E) in the CLP (Fig. 1). The Xifeng section had two sampling gaps about 20 cm thick because of calcareous nodule layers15. The average sampling intervals were 2.9 cm (Xifeng) and 2.5 cm (Lingtai) for magnetic data and 6.4 cm (Xifeng) and 4.3 cm (Lingtai) for grain size data. This dense sampling was performed to detect signals correlated with the millennial- to centennial-scale climate events reported from paleoceanic records. Detailed chronology was another critical factor for this study. Orbital tuning, a method typically applied to loess-paleosol sequences, is not sufficient for the elucidation of millennial-scale climate changes in comparison with other magnetic and climatic records on a global scale. We adopted the most detailed chronostratigraphy for MIS 19, constructed using paleoceanic records from the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitudes5. The individual methods are described in detail below.\n\nMagnetic and grain size analyses and data preparation\n\nχ and χ FD were measured from 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 specimens using a magnetic susceptibility meter SM-100 (ZH Instrument, Brno, Czech Republic). We selected 17,000 Hz as the high frequency (χ hf ) and 500 Hz as the low frequency (χ lf ), measured susceptibility three times for each specimen, and adopted an average. χ lf was used for χ. χ FD was calculated using the formula χ FD = (1 – χ hf /χ lf ) × 100.\n\nFor grain size analyses, organic matter and carbonate were removed from the loess and paleosol samples by adding 30% H 2 O 2 and HCl. The treated samples were added to (NaPO 3 ) 6 as a dispersant, and their grain sizes were measured using a SALD-3000s laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We selected the >16-μm size fraction as a suitable index of the coarse fraction to detect faint signals of interglacial WM intensification caused by moderate-speed winds, the main target of this study. The WM intensification is insensitive to the standard indexes, >40-μm13 or 32-μm23 size fractions, which are sensitive to strong glacial-WM intensification.\n\nFor discussion, we used 3-point moving averaged χ, coarse fraction (%), median grain size, and 5-point moving averaged χ FD values (Figs 2 and 4). We obtained high-pass-filtered (<50‒130 cm in wavelength) data by subtracting the 21-point moving averaged. The χ FD values are more sensitive to SM than are χ values because χ FD dominantly reflects components of pedogenic ultrafine grains, whereas χ reflects components of both coarse aeolian grains and pedogenic grains. Therefore, the post-reversal high-frequency changes have higher amplitudes on the χ FD curves. Moreover, a weak SM interval in L8 was only <130 cm on the χ FD curves, which is much narrower than the 200‒300 cm for a strong SM interval in S8 (Fig. 2c,k). However, the Xifeng χ FD shows nearly flat changes around the clear peaks of SM shown by χ (Fig. 2b,c), as pedogenic components would be dominant and saturated in the χ FD . The cause of the saturation of χ FD is not clear at present, but it may partly relate to the a.r. in Xifeng being somewhat higher than that in Lingtai in addition to precipitation.\n\nClimatostratigraphic correlations and age model\n\nLoess-paleosol layers have been correlated with MISs, principally based on sequential correlations from top to bottom. The correlations until paleosol layer S6 are consistent among studies, below which they split. MIS 19 was generally correlated with S723,25,43, or S818,30. In high-resolution paleoceanic records, the MB boundary lies between the sea-level highstand MIS 19.3 and lowstand MIS 19.23,24,33. In high-resolution loess-magnetostratigraphy records, the MB boundary lies in S8 or the S8/L8 transition, despite differences in a.r. and the degree of pedogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the correlation of S8 with MIS 19.3 is reasonable, whereas the correlation of S7 with MIS 19 requires the assumption of extraordinarily large lock-in depths of magnetization. Laboratory experiments suggest syn-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in loess26,27. Even chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by pedogenic ferrimagnets would be nearly syn-depositional, because the magnetic susceptibility of modern soils indicates that the majority of pedogenic ferrimagnets are formed near the surface; the magnetic susceptibility reaches mature paleosol values (>100 × 10−8kg−1) in a near-surface layer28,29, and shows a linear relationship with the modern precipitation46,47. Thus, small lock-in depths are fairly plausible, and the MB boundary provides a reliable datum level for loess-paleosol sequences.\n\nThe extremely strong WM interval with large grain sizes in the lowermost part of Lingtai (Fig. 2l,m) probably correlates with a full glacial period (MIS 20.2). Such strong coarsening is absent in the L8 layer, in which the grain size is comparable to that in the S8 layer. The median grain sizes for Xifeng and Lingtai are uniform through the S7 and S8 layers, except in the short interval around the SM minimum of L8, with a slight increase of 10–30% (Fig. 2e,m). Hence, the correlation of the L8 layer with a full glacial period is unlikely.\n\nThe short wavelength SM minima in Lingtai and Xifeng correlate with the brief cooling/low sea-level events during the MIS 19 interglacial period (Supplementary Fig. S3)5. Based on magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [χ], anhysteritic remanent magnetization [ARM], and grain size proxy [ARM/χ]), pyrite content, and biogenic productivity, the events were originally interpreted as oxic events (or breaks of anoxia) in the North Pacific Sea bottom (Chiba Section, core TB2)5. They correlate well with the maxima of planktonic δ18O from the same core (TB2), with the low sea-level events in the diatom-based sea-level proxy curve from Osaka Bay4, and with the maxima of planktonic δ18O data from the mid-latitude North Atlantic (IODP Site 1313)3. Thus, we regard the oxic events as brief cooling/low sea-level events, numbered 1‒10 (Supplementary Fig. S3), and show the correlation points with small solid circles in Fig. 4b–d. The labels of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10, and 10b for the events follow Hyodo et al.5, and 1a and 9′ are defined for the first time in this study. Before event 10b, two features in the North Atlantic δ18O curve correlate with those in the Lingtai χ FD curve, shown by small solid squares (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe correlation points were dated based on the astronomical chronology for the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic mid-latitude data5. The depths of Lingtai were dated by linear interpolation between the correlation points and extrapolation beyond the uppermost and lowermost correlation points with the mean a.r.s of the nearest intervals. Ages of the correlation points between Lingtai and Xifeng, shown by small solid triangles (Fig. 4c,d), were determined using the Lingtai age model. Using these correlation points together with those mentioned above, the depths of the Xifeng samples were dated in the same way as those of the Lingtai samples.\n\nThe mean a.r.s between correlation points are shown in Fig. 2h,p. They ranged from 11.8 cm/kyr to 52.4 cm/kyr for Xifeng and from 7.8 cm/kyr to 40.1 cm/kyr for Lingtai. The average time intervals for the a.r. calculations were 2.8 kyr for Xifeng and 2.5 kyr for Lingtai. Our age model shows that the upper and lower boundaries of the MBpf zone spanning 60 cm in Lingtai and 100 cm in Xifeng (Fig. 2) were consistently dated to about 777 and 779 ka, respectively. The MBpf zone must include the main MB boundary, consistent with the data for the North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Osaka Bay (Fig. 4)5. Furthermore, the dated MBpf is consistent with the 776 ± 2 ka Ar/Ar date of the MB transitionally magnetized lavas48 and the mean astronomical age of 778 ka for the MB reversal49. The coincidence suggests small lock-in depths for the loess, as shown by observation of the latest Pleistocene geomagnetic excursions, with little time lag in well-dated loess sections50,51.\n\nThe successive SM features used for correlations are present at both Lingtai and Xifeng, and the age model based on the correlations provides the consistent ages for the MBpf zone between the two sites. These results support the loess-paleosol sequences analyzed herein have no hiatus.",

        "text": "(Natural News) The Green New Deal (GND) peddled by Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC) and her followers may appear to be named as such for the environmentalist ideals it promotes. But the reality is that a war on carbon dioxide is ultimately a war against life on Earth. With a growing number of climate experts are speaking out about the rampant fraud within the climate change industry, many questions about the true purpose of the Green New Deal are arising. As many pundits have declared, the GND is more focused on creating “enviro-socialism” than it is on environmental health.\n\nIndeed, it appears that AOC’s plan is intent on dismantling the United States as we know it, in order to give rise to a new socialist “utopia.” And just like past and current socialist regimes, America under the GND is sure to face food shortages. Only this time, it might be because the Green New Deal destroyed the ecosystem.\n\nBanning CO2 will destroy plant life\n\nFor decades, enviro-terrorists have been blaming the world’s ailments on carbon dioxide (CO2). Yet, this humble molecule is actually essential for plant life to exist. While proponents of climate change are loath to admit it, CO2 is a key part of photosynthesis – the way plants make energy.\n\nCO2 is essentially food for plants. Without CO2, water and sunshine, plants can’t grow. And when plants can’t grow, people starve.\n\nIt is highly concerning that alleged environmentalists are promoting drastic reductions in CO2 as the only solution to climate change (a heavily fabricated theory to begin with). Without photosynthesis, there can be no life on Earth.\n\nDiscover how to prevent and reverse heart disease (and other cardio related events) with this free ebook: Written by popular Natural News writer Vicki Batt, this book includes everything you need to know about preventing heart disease, reversing hypertension, and nurturing your cardiac health without medication. Learn More.\n\nRecent research confirms that carbon dioxide has contributed to global “regreening.” Estimates suggest that increasing CO2 levels has led to a substantial increase in farmable land worldwide. Experts say farmable land has risen by 17 percent, and that overall biosphere productivity has gone up 14 percent since 1982.\n\nResearch also demonstrates that global crop yields have increased by 185 percent worldwide – and scientists say these increases show no signs of slowing. Indeed, it would seem that so-called “global warming” has actually been good for the planet. And as Mike Adams, founder of Natural News and Brighteon.com, contends, warring against CO2 is a war against life itself.\n\nAs Adams explains, burning fossil fuels actually provides plants with more fuel:\n\nBurning fossil fuels, by the way, means combusting hydrocarbons to release energy. One of the byproducts of burning fossil fuels is the release of CO2 into the atmosphere, providing fresh CO2 that plants are starving to harvest from the air. CO2 levels in the atmosphere right now are at near-emergency low levels of barely above 400 ppm. Forests, food crops and indigenous plants across the globe would flourish at double or triple the current level of CO2. If we had, for example, 1200 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere,the Earth would be greener and more lush.\n\nThe leftist call to eliminate carbon from the atmosphere is a suicide mission. In 2017, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Chief Scott Pruitt even stated that he did not believe CO2 was a primary contributor to climate change. There is no shortage of reasons to be skeptical of climate change in and of itself, given the numerous instances of fraud and faulty data. Ultimately, the idea that CO2 is a vehicle of climate change is a hypothesis – and a poorly thought out one, at that.\n\nDestroy the planet, dismantle the United States\n\nIt is no wonder that skeptics now believe that climate change fear-mongering and the GND have nothing to do with environmental concerns – and everything to do with ushering in a New World Order. The GND even spells it out for us, with AOC and her minions promising “a massive transformation of our society with clear goals and a timeline.”\n\nThe GND is further described as a “10-year plan to mobilize every aspect of American society at a scale not seen since World War 2 to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and create economic prosperity for all.”\n\nIf that’s not a dog whistle for a new socialist regime, I don’t know what is. The Green New Deal would kill the U.S. economy, American freedom and the environment in one fell swoop – and this is what the Left wants people to think progress looks like.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nCarbonDioxide.news\n\nInvestors.com\n\nTheFederalist.com\n\nRealClearPolitics.com",

        "text": "(Natural News) Now we come to the end game for humanity. This is it, folks: They have a plan to collapse global food production, kill off over 90% of the human race, devastate natural ecosystems and pollute the Earth’s atmosphere… and it’s all being sold to you under the banner of “environmentalism.”\n\nThe scheme is called “global dimming,” and it’s a dangerous geoengineering plot to spray billions of tons of smog into the atmosphere so that pollution levels would block sunlight and halt global warming. This is literally what the mad environmental scientists are now proposing — the very same people who have, for years, claimed that “chemtrails” are a conspiracy theory and don’t exist. Now, all of a sudden, they want to chemtrail the entire planet in order to “save” us all from global warming.\n\n“Stratospheric aerosol injection” now the new name for chemtrails / geoengineering\n\nThe global dimming scheme is, of course, based on spraying chemtrails into the upper atmosphere using thousands of high-altitude flights that release pollution to dim the sun. The very idea of “chemtrails” has, until now, been mocked by the media and the science establishment, who have for years claimed the very idea of chemtrails is a lunatic conspiracy theory. So they’ve changed the name to “stratospheric aerosol injection,” and they now have a science paper that outlines all the costs involved.\n\n“We lay out a future solar geoengineering deployment scenario of halving the increase in anthropogenic radiative forcing,” writes Wake Smith and Gernot Wagner in their paper, “Stratospheric aerosol injection tactics and costs in the first 15 years of deployment.” Published in Environmental Research Letters, you can view the full text of the study at this link.\n\nSupport our mission to keep you informed: Discover the extraordinary benefits of turmeric gummy bears and organic \"turmeric gold\" liquid extract, both laboratory tested for heavy metals, microbiology and safety. Naturally high in potent curcuminoids. Delicious formulations. All purchases support this website (as well as your good health). See availability here.\n\nGeoengineering is another term that many people use synonymously with “chemtrails.” And now it’s a strategy being openly advocated by scientists to halt so-called “climate change,” a fake science hoax that has been perpetrated on the world by power-hungry globalists who want humanity to surrender to global rule in the name of “saving the planet.”\n\nThe study cites the specific aircraft that would be needed to achieve chemtrails pollution. “[P]urpose-built high-altitude tanker with substantial payload capabilities” would be deployed to spray sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. The paper proposes 4000 flights a year, costing $2.25 billion per year, continuing over 15 years to make sure the atmosphere is significantly polluted to dim the sun and achieve the terraforming goals of globalists (see more details, below).\n\nIn the conclusion of their abstract, the study authors explain the program would require, “thousands of flights annually by airliner-sized aircraft operating from an international array of bases,” making it almost impossible to keep secret.\n\nOf course, this very program has already begun, and secrecy isn’t necessary when you have the entire media and science establishment condemning any belief in chemtrails as a form of mental illness. So just remember: As they pollute the skies and dim the sun, if you point out that they’re polluting the skies and dimming the sun, you’re a “conspiracy theorist.”\n\nAnd there’s no such thing as chemtrails, you see. Nope, it’s “stratospheric aerosol injection” now, which sounds almost sciency. That’s how this program is already being perpetrated right under our noses, right now, even while the media runs a global cover-up to dismiss such ideas as bizarre theories.\n\nThe global controllers hope you never read the science papers, of course, because there, geoengineering is routinely cited and even advocated as the “solution” to climate change.\n\nStratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) explained… and yeah, it’s just another name for chemtrails\n\n“Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) would require lofting hundreds of thousands to millions of tons of material each year to altitudes up to ~20 km,” explain study authors. They also ask, “Could it be done in secret?”\n\nThe study offers heavy discussion on the design and costs of aircraft that could deliver the planned pollution to the upper atmosphere:\n\nIPCC (2018) states that ‘there is high agreement that aircrafts after some modifications could inject millions of tons of SO2 in the lower stratosphere (~20 km)’.\n\nThe overall goal of the geoengineering program is to inject 5 million tons of SO2 (sulfur dioxide, otherwise known as “smog”) into the atmosphere. Achieving that goal, “assumes a rational actor seeking to implement a scientifically sensible SAI program,” write the study authors, somehow claiming it is “rational” to disperse mass pollution across the atmosphere of your own planet. The same authors also claim this program must be conducted, “purely out of humanitarian and environmental considerations.”\n\nShocking realization: This is terraforming planet Earth to collapse the global food supply and kill off humans\n\nIn considering the sheer lunacy of the “Stratospheric Aerosol Injection” plan, I feel compelled to state that these climate change / global warming scientists are dangerously insane sociopaths and they must be stopped before they murder us all. These lunatics, if given enough government funding, will literally murder our planet and destroy human civilization. Such is the cost of the decades of false propaganda in our public schools that has brainwashed children into believing “climate change” is real and must be halted. The schemes now being proposed to halt this non-existent problem will, themselves, bring about the global destruction that children are being warned about with global warming.\n\nThis global pollution / terraforming program, if allowed to continue, could unleash the following devastating consequences, especially if deployed at a time when the sun is in its own dimming cycle that would accelerate global cooling.\n\n#1) Global collapse of food crops – The reduction in solar radiation caused by geoengineering, combined with the natural cycle of global cooling from sun cycles, could produce a sharp reduction in food crop production across the globe. This would result in increased food prices and reduced food supplies, adding to vectors for civil unrest and “climate refugees” invading First World nations to escape starvation.\n\n#2) Global rise in cancer from vitamin D deficiency – Reduction in solar radiation reaching the surface of the planet would exacerbate vitamin D deficiencies that already strongly contribute to cancer fatalities around the world. Sunlight is currently the primary source of vitamin D for billions of world citizens. Dimming the sun would be a death sentence for millions each year who would suffer the dire consequences of chronic vitamin D deficiencies.\n\n#3) Global drop in IQs due to increased air pollution – Increases in air pollution have been scientifically found to lower children’s IQs. In addition, air pollution is scientifically documented to damage DNA in the womb, increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and increase the risk of bone loss in humans.\n\n#4) Massive loss of habitat and ecosystems due to decreased sunlight and colder temperatures – Entire ecosystems — such as rainforests — could be devastated by a pollution-initiated drop in solar radiation. Marine ecosystems also rely heavily on solar radiation to power the photosynthesis of ocean plants such as seaweeds, grasses and algae, which serve as a pillar food source for the entire marine food web. Dimming the sun would have devastating consequences for all ecosystems on the planet, resulting in a catastrophic loss of life, habitat and eco-diversity.\n\n#5) Huge increase in global acid rain that will devastate forests and food crops – The mass injection of SO2 into the atmosphere will result in SO2 being dispersed into lower levels of the atmosphere over time. There, mixed with rain storms, it will create sulfurous acid, otherwise known as acid rain. This acid rain will devastate forests and food crops and result in the acidification of crop soils, destabilizing soil microbes and leading the widespread crop losses.\n\n#6) Decreased plant production of oxygen that’s necessary for humans, primates and mammals to survive – Nearly all plants depend on solar radiation for photosynthesis, which uses CO2 as a “fuel” and produces oxygen (O2) as a byproduct. Reducing solar radiation through chemtrails pollution would reduce the production of oxygen by plants, resulting in a global fall in atmospheric oxygen levels, ultimately leading to the mass asphyxiation of humans, primates and mammals if allowed to continue. Even the EPA (see source below) admits that SO2 interferes with human respiration and makes it difficult for people to breathe.\n\nEven the EPA recognizes sulfur dioxide as a dangerous pollutant that makes it difficult for humans to breathe\n\nNote carefully that the geoengineering efforts being advocated to dim the sun are based on sulfur dioxide, a known pollutant. “Short-term exposures to SO2 can harm the human respiratory system and make breathing difficult,” warns the EPA. “…[G]aseous SOx can harm trees and plants by damaging foliage and decreasing growth… SO2 and other sulfur oxides can contribute to acid rain which can harm sensitive ecosystems,” the EPA writes.\n\nIn other words, it isn’t even debated whether sulfur dioxide is a pollutant. It’s smog (or technically, it reacts to create smog), and the very idea that mass polluting the atmosphere with SO2 would somehow “save” the planet is rooted in nothing less than advanced psychosis or some other dangerous form of mental illness. That such schemes are marketed under the banner of “science” just shows how twisted the institution of science has now become.\n\nWhy would any rational institution seek to mass pollute our entire planet and destroy food crops, forests, mammals, primates and humans? The answer is even more shocking than the proposal itself, it turns out. Keep reading, as one possible explanation for all this continues below…\n\nIt wasn’t long ago that scientists warned about “global cooling” and the coming Ice Age\n\nIt was only a generation ago that young scientists were being warned that Earth was entering a “global cooling” crisis that would bring about a whole new ice age. This was the climate panic of the 1970s and early 1980s. Today’s older scientists remember the warnings quite well. We were all told that if we didn’t find a way to warm the planet, we would all perish as Earth was turned into a ball of ice.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, the scientists flipped the script, reversing their warning and suddenly claiming the problem was too much heat. We were all going to die from global warming if we didn’t change something, we were told. A decade or so later, when it was revealed that government science scammers were faking all the warming data, they changed the scam to “climate change,” since they couldn’t scientifically support either warming or cooling.\n\nHere’s the cover of TIME Magazine from 1977, which warns, “How To Survive The Coming Ice Age,” then urges readers to get on board to save the planet, saying, “51 Things You Can Do to Make a Difference.”\n\nToday, we’re told the most absurd, insane things by these scientists who insist that the climate never changed at all before the year 1920, with the rise of the combustion engine and “human activity.” And now we’re constantly terrorized by the fake news media into thinking that if we don’t pollute the Earth’s atmosphere with smog, we will all somehow die from the rise of carbon dioxide, the No. 1 most important greening nutrient for plants, forests and food crops.\n\nSo now they’ve decided they have to poison the atmosphere to fight climate change, and they’ve got about a billion gullible world citizens convinced that this is somehow an amazing idea. What they would really unleash, of course, is absolutely catastrophic to all life on our world. Remember: They want to disperse billions of tons of sulfur dioxide (smog) into the atmosphere through massive government-funded chemtrailing of the planet. The question now emerges: Is the destruction of humanity deliberate? If so, who would hatch such a nefarious plan?\n\nGeoengineering is a planet-wide weapon system being deployed to eliminate human life on Earth while terraforming the planet for some other purpose\n\nHere’s the cosmic inconvenient truth that Al Gore doesn’t want you to consider. What we are really witnessing here is the planned terraforming of planet Earth for some other purpose. And by “other,” I mean other than human.\n\nIf you wanted humans to thrive on planet Earth, you would not unleash mass pollution, acid rain, food crop failures, oxygen depletion and global dimming. You would, instead, try to reduce pollution, support plant life, enhance food crop production and protect global ecosystems from pollution. That’s the normal, rational thing that any human being would naturally want to pursue.\n\nYet we are subjected to these nefarious geoengineering schemes that directly contradict every principle of sustainable life on Earth. And it’s all described as a way to “save” the planet, even as it would destroy global life support for humans.\n\nI can’t help but be reminded of the outstanding film Oblivion, starring Tom Cruise. In the film, the Cruise character thinks he’s protecting human civilization, but he’s actually (unknowingly) working for extraterrestrials who are stealing Earth’s resources and exterminating humans. The film is one of the best science fiction films of all time, and its story sounds eerily similar to what may be happening right now with so-called “geoengineering.”\n\nWho (or what) would want to alter the atmosphere, decimate oxygen levels, destroy the food supply and collapse human civilization? The answer should be obvious: Something that is in competition with humans and sees no further use for humanity. Human life on Earth appears to be in the process of being “cleansed” in a cosmic ethnic cleansing scheme that will produce an altered, low-oxygen atmosphere that might prove advantageous to a life form which isn’t already part of Earth’s existing ecosystem. The reduction in solar radiation reaching Earth’s surface would make the planet more hospital to a life form that originated from a planet located farther from its home sun than Earth is from our own sun.\n\nIt raises the obvious, if bizarre-sounding, question: Are Earth’s globalists preparing the planet for a post-human era? And is that plan disguised as a “climate change” emergency course of action so that the sheeple can be told the mass pollution of the skies is a bold plan to save humanity rather than exterminate it? What if “climate change” is actually a cosmic false flag hoax that was designed from the very start to convince Earthlings to support their own extermination? Given the now-planned destruction of Earth’s atmosphere in the name of “climate change,” we must now consider such possibilities, no matter how bizarre they first seem.\n\nWhy are all the globalists suddenly talking about escaping to Mars and terraforming Mars into a habitat where humans can survive? Why are globalists now so desperate the alter Earth’s atmosphere and make the planet inhospitable to humans? Why such a recent focus on the Arctic seed vault to preserve the seeds of life in preparation for a global cataclysm? Why are so many globalist insiders building underground bunkers and living in them?\n\nI don’t have the answers to all these questions, but I do know that the fairy tale stories we’re being told about “climate change” and how we must save the planet by polluting the skies are rooted in complete quack science fiction and brainwashing propaganda.\n\nOn the other hand, if humans are stupid enough to destroy their own planet in the name of saving the planet, perhaps they’re simply not qualified to participate in an intelligence universe after all. Natural selection, after all, is likely playing out on a cosmic scale, and Earth appears to be flunking the cosmic IQ test that wonders, “Hey, is that civilization stupid enough to commit suicide based on a fairy tale hoax?”\n\nSo far, it appears the answer for Earth and humans is a resounding “Yes!”\n\nThis entire topic, by the way, will be featured in this Sunday’s broadcast of Counterthink, airing at 6pm cental at InfoWars.com, with the full episode also appearing at Counterthink.com a few days later.

Yet how global vegetation is responding to the changing environment is not well established. Here we use three long-term satellite leaf area index (LAI) records and ten global ecosystem models to investigate four key drivers of LAI trends during 1982–2009. We show a persistent and widespread increase of growing season integrated LAI (greening) over 25% to 50% of the global vegetated area, whereas less than 4% of the globe shows decreasing LAI (browning). Factorial simulations with multiple global ecosystem models suggest that CO 2 fertilization effects explain 70% of the observed greening trend, followed by nitrogen deposition (9%), climate change (8%) and land cover change (LCC) (4%). CO 2 fertilization effects explain most of the greening trends in the tropics, whereas climate change resulted in greening of the high latitudes and the Tibetan Plateau. LCC contributed most to the regional greening observed in southeast China and the eastern United States. The regional effects of unexplained factors suggest that the next generation of ecosystem models will need to explore the impacts of forest demography, differences in regional management intensities for cropland and pastures, and other emerging productivity constraints such as phosphorus availability.",

        "text": "(Natural News) Everything you’ve been told about global warming, climate change and carbon dioxide by the mainstream media — and mainstream “science” — is an outright lie. Far from being a dangerous poison, carbon dioxide is a miraculous life-giving nutrient that plants need to thrive. Rising carbon dioxide is actually helping “green” the planet, as any legitimate science already knows. Without CO2 in the atmosphere, nearly all life on the planet would collapse, including both human life and plant life. (See my numerous science videos, below, which explain all this in detail.)\n\nNow, an eye-opening interview has emerged that features István Markó, an organic chemistry researcher and professor at the Université catholique de Louvain. He was recently interviewed by Grégoire Canlorbe, a science journalist and out-of-the-box thinker. I’m publishing parts of the interview below, and I encourage you to read the full interview at GregoireCanlorbe.com.\n\nAll the words below are from István Markó, except the subhead titles, which are mine:\n\nThe truth about carbon dioxide\n\nAgain, CO 2 is not, and has never been, a poison. Each of our exhalations, each of our breaths, emits an astronomical quantity of CO 2 proportionate to that in the atmosphere (some >40,000 ppm); and it is very clear that the air we expire does not kill anyone standing in front of us. What must be understood, besides, is that CO 2 is the elementary food of plants. Without CO 2 there would be no plants, and without plants there would be no oxygen and therefore no humans. The equation is as simple as that.\n\nSupport our mission and enhance your own self-reliance: The laboratory-verified Organic Emergency Survival Bucket provides certified organic, high-nutrition storable food for emergency preparedness. Completely free of corn syrup, MSG, GMOs and other food toxins. Ultra-clean solution for years of food security. Learn more at the Health Ranger Store.\n\nPlants need CO 2 , water, and daylight. These are the mechanisms of photosynthesis, to generate the sugars that will provide them with staple food and building blocks. That fundamental fact of botany is one of the primary reasons why anyone who is sincerely committed to the preservation of the “natural world” should abstain from demonizing CO 2 . Over the last 30 years, there has been a gradual increase in the CO 2 level. But what is also observed is that despite deforestation, the planet’s vegetation has grown by about 20%. This expansion of vegetation on the planet, nature lovers largely owe it to the increase in the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere.\n\nIf we study, however, what has been happening at the geological level for several million years, we realize that the present period is characterized by an extraordinarily low CO 2 level. During the Jurassic, Triassic, and so on, the CO 2 level rose to values sometimes of the order of 7000, 8000, 9000 ppm, which considerably exceeds the paltry 400 ppm that we have today. Not only did life exist, in those far-off times when CO 2 was so present in large concentration in the atmosphere, but plants such as ferns commonly attained heights of 25 meters. Reciprocally, far from benefiting the current vegetation, the reduction of the presence of CO 2 in the atmosphere would be likely to compromise the health, and even the survival, of numerous plants. To fall below the threshold of 280 or 240 ppm would plainly lead to the extinction of a large variety of our vegetal species.\n\nIn addition, our relentless crusade to reduce CO 2 could be more harmful to nature as plants are not the only organisms to base their nutrition on CO 2 . Phytoplankton species also feed on CO 2 , using carbon from CO 2 as a building unit and releasing oxygen. By the way, it is worth remembering that ~70% of the oxygen present today in the atmosphere comes from phytoplankton, not trees: contrary to common belief, it is not the forests, but the oceans, that constitute the “lungs” of the earth.\n\nThe truth about the “greenhouse effect”\n\nAbout the supposed link between global warming and CO 2 emissions, it is simply not true that CO 2 has a major greenhouse effect. It is worth remembering, here too, that CO 2 is a minor gas. Today it represents only 0.04% of the composition of the air; and its greenhouse effect is attributed the value of 1. The major greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is water vaporwhich is ten times more potent than CO 2 in its greenhouse effect. Water vapor is present in a proportion of 2% in the atmosphere. Those facts are, in principle, taught at school and at university, but one still manages to incriminate CO 2 alongside this learning, in using a dirty trick that presents the warming effect of CO 2 as minor but exacerbated, through feedback loops, by the other greenhouse effects.\n\nHow status quo science brainwashes people and turns them into obedient robots who spout scientific nonsense\n\nI believe in science: I mean that I believe in the possibility of objectively knowing reality through science. I believe that there are truth and falsehood, that science allows us to distinguish between the two, and that truth must be known; that scientific knowledge must be placed in the hands of the population. I also believe in freedom. I believe that every man is entitled to lead his life and to manage his goods as he sees fit, that he is the only possessor of himself, and that statist socio-economic control is as morally reprehensible as it is harmful in its social, economic, and environmental consequences.\n\nI note two things distressing me: firstly, the population is increasingly misinformed scientifically; and secondly, the media and governments take advantage of this to propagate a theory that is doubtful, namely that of anthropogenic warming, and to promote coercive measures on its behalf. Few people take the time to get vital information about the actual CO 2 footprint; and few people, more generally, are still interested in science. I deeply regret that our Western societies have succeeded in cultivating such mistrust of science: such a reluctance to have confidence in its capacity to know the world objectively and to transform it positively.\n\nThe theory of anthropogenic warming claims to be scientific; but if people accept this theory, if they hold it to be true, it is clearly not out of interest for science. Such a fragile theory, in view of the CO 2 facts I have presented to you above, could never have been accepted by people who truly care about science; and who possess a deep understanding in that field. In my eyes, there are two main reasons—or if you prefer, two main types of feelings—that make people let themselves be seduced by the theory of anthropogenic warming so readily. In the first place, the Catholic religion is in decline in the Western world; and what I call ecologism comes to replace it.\n\nIn the second place, Westerners have a pronounced taste for self-flagellation; and the theory of anthropogenic warming provides justification for that tendency, possibly anchored in our Judeo-Christian heritage. So, on the one hand, we have religious feelings: faith in a new system of thought, which is ecologism; the veneration of a new divinity, which is benevolent and protective Nature. On the other hand, we have a feeling of guilt, expressed in our conviction that, if the climate warms up, it is our fault; and that if we do not immediately limit our CO 2 emissions, we will have sullied and disfigured our planet.\n\nRising ocean levels and melting ice caps\n\nOver the last 12,000 years, what we have witnessed is an oscillation between warm and cold periods, thus periods with rising and declining sea levels. Incontestably, sea and ocean levels have been on the rise since the end of the Little Ice Age that took place approximately from the beginning of the 14th century until the end of the 19th century. At the end of that period, global temperatures started to rise. That being said, the recorded rise is 0.8 degrees Celsius and is, therefore, nothing extraordinary. If the temperature goes up, ocean water obviously dilates and some glaciers recede. This is something glaciers have always done, and not a specificity of our time.\n\nThus, in Ancient Roman times, glaciers were much smaller than the ones we know nowadays. I invite the reader to look at the documents dating back to the days of Hannibal, who managed to cross the Alps with his elephants because he did not encounter ice on his way to Rome, (except during a snow storm just before arriving on the Italian plain). Today, you could no longer make Hannibal’s journey. He proved to be capable of such an exploit, precisely because it was warmer in Roman times.\n\nSea levels are currently on the rise; but this is an overestimated phenomenon. The recorded rise is 1.5 millimeters per year, namely 1.5 cm every ten years, and is, therefore, not dramatic at all. Indeed, it does happen that entire islands do get engulfed; but in 99% of the cases, that is due to a classic erosion phenomenon[2] and not to rising sea levels. As far as the Italian city of Venice is concerned, the fact it has been faced with water challenges is not due to any rise of the lagoon level; and is just the manifestation of the sad reality that “the City of the Doges” is sinking under its weight on the marshland. Once again, the global sea and ocean levels are rising; but the threat effectively represented by that phenomenon is far from being tangible. I note that the Tuvalu islands, whose engulfment was previously announced as imminent, not only have not been engulfed, but have seen their own land level rise with respect to that of waters around them.\n\nStill another phenomenon we tend to exaggerate is the melting of the polar caps. The quantity of ice in the Arctic has not gone down for 10 years: one may well witness, from one year to the other, ice level fluctuations, but on average that level has remained constant. Right after the Little Ice Age, since the temperature went up, the Artic started to melt; but the ice level in the Arctic finally settled down. Besides, ice has been expanding in Antarctica over the last 30 years; and similarly, we observe in Greenland that the quantity of ice increased by 112 million cubic kilometers last year. On a global scale, glaciers account for peanuts, with most of the ice being located in Antarctica and on Greenland. One cannot but notice an almost unchanged ice level over hundreds of years.\n\n…We are told that the level of water will increase throughout the world and increase to the point that it will overwhelm a large part of our continents. As Hans von Storch, one of the world’s leading climate modelers, has shown, the models supporting those forecasts are, for 98% of them, totally false. We are told that the air we breathe in the big cities has never been so polluted. One only must review the documents oneself about the air that people used to breath in London in the 1960s to realize how much urban pollution has diminished. In Peking, often castigated for poor air quality, there happens, every now and then, a fog reminiscent of the London smog. But even that pollution in Peking is far from competing with that which, a short while ago, reigned in London.\n\nGlobal “warming” and temperature models\n\nMany other climate myths and legends exist. From storms to tornados, extreme events are going down all around the world; and when they occur, their level is much lower, too. As explained by MIT physicist Richard Lindzen, the reduction of the temperature differential between the north hemisphere and the equatorial part of our planet makes cyclonic energy much smaller: the importance and frequency of extreme events thus tend to decrease. But once again, the rise of temperatures shows a magnitude considerably lower with respect to that we currently project.\n\nIf you look at satellite data and weather balloon measurements, you then note that the temperature rise around the world is relatively modest; that it is much lower than the rise that is predicted for us by authorities, and that these predictions rely on calculations that are highly uncertain. This is because the simulation inputs cannot take into account past temperatures (for which there is no precision data[3]), except by subjectively adjusting x, y, z data that are not always known. The recent temperature spikes measured by satellites and balloons are part of a classic natural phenomenon which is called El Niño. This short-term phenomenon consists of a return of the very warm waters at the surface of the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The heat thus liberated in the atmosphere pushes up the global temperature and CO 2 plays no role in that process.\n\nAnother issue I would like to raise: present deserts, far from expanding, are receding; and they are receding due to the higher quantity of CO 2 available in the air. It turns out that greenhouse operators voluntarily inject three times as much CO 2 in the commercial greenhouse as it is present in the atmosphere. The result we can observe is that plants grow faster and are bigger, that they are more resistant to diseases and to destructive insects, and that their photosynthesis is way more efficient and that they therefore consume, less water. Similarly, the rise of CO 2 level in the atmosphere makes that plants need less water and thus that they can afford to colonize arid regions.\n\nRegarding diseases and other weird phenomena hastily attributed to climate warming, there is a website—“globalwarminghoax.com,” if I recall —that collects the different rumors and contemplations on this theme. The fact that masculine fertility decreases; the fact that birds’ wings shrink; the fact that a shark showed up in the North Sea; absolutely anything is likely to be connected to climate change if one displays enough intellectual dishonesty. That is where honest journalists come into play: your role is to investigate on the true reason of phenomena and to demystify the ready-made thinking that financial and political forces ask the media to channel slavishly.\n\nClimate-related diseases are relatively rare; and even malaria does not directly depend on the climate, but rather on the way we enable the parasite to reproduce and the mosquito to flourish in the place where we are located. If you find yourself in a swampy area, the odds you will get malaria are high; if you have drained the system and you no longer have that wetland, the odds you will catch the disease are very low. In the end, automatically blaming the resurgence of some disease on climate change comes down to removing the personal responsibility from the people involved: such as denying that their refusal of vaccinations, for instance, or their lack of hygiene, may be part of the problem.\n\nThe economic failure of wind power\n\nThe wind industry, over which ecologists swoon, produces highly unpredictable output, depending on the intensity of the wind. Even under good atmospheric conditions, wind delivers too little electricity to be a profitable industry on its own. Warren Buffet, who owns one of the largest wind farms in Iowa, said it without embarrassment: “On wind power, we get a tax credit if we build a lot of wind farms. This is the only reason to build them. They do not make sense without the tax credit.” The ecological balance is just as bad: onshore wind turbines kill hundreds of thousands, even millions of birds and bats per year. As for wind turbines at sea, they kill many marine mammals, again in the utmost indifference of ecologists.\n\nThoughts on world government and eco-tyranny\n\nMany persons, generally those coming from the former Eastern Bloc, let themselves be seduced by the idea that the resolution of our environmental problems would be that of global governance. In many respects, ecologism is also the communism of the 21st century. In the same way as Islam, it occupies the place left vacant by the decline of Marxism-Leninism. I do not know if a convergence of struggles between Islamists and ecologists will actually take shape; however, I note that we already have the equivalent, on a smaller scale, of the global ecological caliphate. I am thinking of the European Union, which gives us a foretaste of the bureaucratic, global, and totalitarian governance that the United Nations manifestly endeavors to establish.\n\nSince we are talking about globalization, envisioned in its political aspect, the prospect of a world government, but also in its economic and, say, informational aspect—the networking, sometimes instantaneous, of humans, goods, and ideas—I would like to opine a possible perverse effect. As cultures and mentalities mingle, the Westerners’ ecologist (or Gaianist) religion, as well as their penchant for repentance, seem to even reach some of the Asian peoples. Japan, which emerged spiritually emasculated from the Second World War, is more conducive to letting itself be invaded by that Western sanctification of the self-denial of ecologism.\n\nThe global depopulation agenda\n\nThe agreement of the Paris COP 21 was not signed to save the planet and to prevent us from roasting due to an imaginary temperature increase of +2°C. Behind all that masquerade is hidden, as always, the ugly face of power, greed, and profit. All the industrialists who are in favor of that commitment, which will ruin Europe and immensely impoverish its citizens, do so for the good reason they find in it a huge and easy source of income. As for NGOs, when they are not simply motivated by greed, their motive consists in a resolutely Malthusian ideology. Their object is to return the world to a very small population, on the order of a few hundred million people. To do so, they impoverish the world, remove the power of fossil fuel energies, and thus ensure that the number of deaths increases.\n\n### Interview end.\n\nThoughts on glyphosate\n\nInterestingly, Marko is pro-glyphosate, saying it is only”half as toxic as salt.” He even adds, “I am ready to drink ten grams of glyphosate in front of you,” but nowhere is he recorded as actually having done so.\n\nIt just goes to show you that real scientists are independent thinkers who may have very diverse conclusions on a variety of science-based topics. To this day, however, I have not seen any scientist gobble down ten grams of glyphosate. Sadly, Marko has already passed, so he won’t be available to demonstrate his confidence in this herbicide, either.\n\nNevertheless, it’s clear that Marko was a brilliant thinker and a man who was dedicated to his pursuit of scientific understanding and truth.

        "text": "(Natural News) On Thursday Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) introduced a so-called “economic development plan” that will not only bankrupt America if it is ever fully adopted, but it will reverse more than a century of societal and technological progress.\n\nAccording to an overview of the plan, which Ocasio-Cortez is calling the “Green New Deal,” it is decade-long “massive transformation of our society with clear goals and a timeline,” Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) said.\n\nSpecifically, the Green New Deal — and bear in mind we’re not making any of this up — calls for:\n\n— The elimination of all air travel, at least in the United States. Not only does that mean domestic flights, but that also includes foreign travel (not sure if Ocasio-Cortez and her fellow “Democratic Socialists” would allow airliners from foreign countries to fly to the U.S. and land here).\n\n— The replacement of air travel with “high-speed rail” travel, essentially turning a four-and-a-half hour flight from Los Angeles to New York City into a 24-hour ordeal or more. “Build out highspeed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary,” the plan says.\n\n— The literal rebuilding of every single building in the United States: “Upgrade or replace every building in U.S. for state-of-the-art energy efficiency.”\n\n— The end of all traditional forms of energy currently in use in the U.S., to be replaced by ‘green’ renewable energy sans nuclear power (wind and solar). In fact, ‘if possible,’ the plan calls for the elimination of all nuclear power plants. It’s “a 10-year plan to mobilize every aspect of American society at a scale not seen since World War 2 to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.”\n\nFurther: “It’s unclear if we will be able to decommission every nuclear plant within 10 years, but the plan is to transition off of nuclear and all fossil fuels as soon as possible.”\n\nWhy is that ‘unclear?’ You’d think the brainiacs who concocted this scheme would have researched that aspect. Hint: It’s not possible. The Nuclear Energy Institute says the process takes 60 years to complete properly. But hey, when you’re a 29-year-old ex-bartender, these are mere details. (Related: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez earns an “F” in science for demanding 100% renewable energy in 10 years.)\n\n— Replacing “carbon capture” with a much simpler plan: Have all Americans become forest managers. “We believe the right way to capture carbon is to plant trees and restore our natural ecosystems. CCUS technology to date has not proven effective,” says the plan.\n\nAnd the best part is, we don’t have to worry about how to pay for it all\n\nThere’s more beyond just the ecological/environmental aspect.\n\n“The Green New Deal fully tackles the existential threat posed by climate change by presenting a comprehensive, 10-year plan that is as big as the problem it hopes to solve while creating a new era of shared prosperity,” according to a summary of the plan, The National Sentinel reported.\n\n“We … need to be sure that workers currently employed in fossil fuel industries have higher-wage and better jobs available to them to be able to make this transition, and a federal jobs guarantee ensures that no worker is left behind,” the summary continued.\n\nWhat does that mean? Social justice, of course. The plan would “ensure that all GND jobs are union jobs that pay prevailing wages and hire local.” Of course — because the unions can’t grow these days without corporations being forced to implement them.\n\nAnd just how does Ocasio-Cortez think this plan will be paid for? Easy; just have the Treasury print more money. “The Federal Reserve can extend credit to power these projects and investments and new public banks can be created to extend credit,” the plan says.\n\nBut that’s not important anyway, as ATR noted. Ocasio-Cortez says what really matters “isn’t how will we pay for it, but what will we do with our new shared prosperity.”\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nRead more about the Democratic Socialists’ endgame for America at EndGame.news.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheNationalSentinel.com\n\nATR.org",

        "text": "Ocasio-Cortez goes FULL CULT, claims “the world is gonna end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change”\n\nThe stupidity never ends with socialist New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who on Martin Luther King Jr. day told an audience at Riverside Church in New York City that we have a little more than a decade before the world ends due to “climate change.”\n\nThe 29-year-old former bartender and always crazy-looking in photos nutcase contends that younger people like herself, which includes so-called “millennials” and “Generation Z,” have been trying to wake up the older generations to this impending threat, but without much success.\n\nWhile speaking to Ta-Nehisi Paul Coates, who was interviewing her at Riverside Church, Ocasio-Cortez spewed a litany of far-left talking points about climate change and global warming, both of which have repeatedly been debunked as communistic, fake news fear-mongering.\n\n“… and I think that the part of it that is generational is that millennials, and people and you know, Gen-Z, and all these folks that come after us, are looking up and we’re like, ‘the world is going to end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change, and your biggest issue is, your, your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it?'” Ocasio-Cortez stated, trying to sound smart and informed.\n\n“And like, this is the war, this is our World War II. And … I think for younger people we’re looking at this and we’re like ‘how, how are we saying, let’s take it easy when 3,000 Americans died last year?'” she added.\n\nOccasional-Cortex compares climate change to “World War II,” implies global warming will have same impact as Nazi Germany Holocaust on millennials\n\nTo compare a mythological concept like global warming to the Nazi Holocaust is the type of insanity one would come to expect from a deranged lunatic like Occasional-Cortex, who’s clearly a major success story of public school brainwashing and indoctrination.\n\nSponsored solution from CWC Labs: This heavy metals test kit allows you to test almost anything for 20+ heavy metals and nutritive minerals, including lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, aluminum and more.

Learn more here.\n\nKeep in mind that Ocasio-Cortez’s most recent inane statements about global warming are nothing new, as earlier climate fanatics like Al Gore were spewing the same claptrap decades ago – and obviously we’re all still here and the world hasn’t ended yet, as Gore and the rest of the Climate Cult has been fear-mongering about for many years.\n\n“Ocasio-Cortez was only barely born when the U.N. first warned in 1989 that ‘entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth’ by the year 2000 if global warming wasn’t stopped,” notes Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.\n\n“In the years following, Al Gore has made numerous predictions about the world coming to an end, always moving the deadline after being proven wrong again and again. The reason these predictions keep failing, of course, is because Al Gore and the rest of the global warming hoax crowd are all lying.”\n\nGore, as you may recall, more recently warned that the global warming apocalypse had already arrived after he personally observed fish flopping around in some of the low-lying streets of Miami, Florida – a natural occurrence that happens every single day due to the tides rising and falling as they always do.\n\nIn Gore’s demented mind, high tides somehow indicate that global warming is real – and it would appear that Ocasio-Cortez has now adopted the same ridiculous narrative in order to propel it into the next generation of brain-dead idiots who will carry the torch of climate change fanaticism into the next generation.\n\n“AOC is a scientifically illiterate fool who operates on the verge of mental retardation,” Adams warns.\n\n“But in the same way you should never give a retarded child access to nuclear launch codes, you also shouldn’t give a scientifically illiterate socialist moron anything resembling political power in Washington. It’s dangerous to society when people run around making utterly false claims that the ‘world will end in 12 years’ if we don’t surrender all rights, freedom and economic power to the very same people who fabricated the climate change hoax in the first place.”\n\nFor more climate change news, be sure to check out ClimateAlarmism.news.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nTheGatewayPundit.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nNaturalNews.com",
