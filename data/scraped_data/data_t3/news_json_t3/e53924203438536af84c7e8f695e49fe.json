One Facebook group, dubbed \"I'm 10-15,\" was exposed by the investigative reporting group ProPublica and reportedly included current and former Border Patrol agents.\n\nAssistant Commissioner for CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility Matt Klein told reporters in a call Monday that the majority of the individuals identified so far are from the \"I'm 10-15\" group, while some were part of other Facebook groups, including \"The Real CBP Nation,\" which CNN reported on earlier this month\n\n\"Obviously the number of cases, we anticipate will continue to grow as we receive additional information and perform further research and conduct interviews,\" Klein said.\n\nCBP officials said at the time that they were investigating \"disturbing social media activity.\"\n\nRead More",

        "text": "(CNN) At least one other social media group with an apparent nexus to Customs and Border Protection has been discovered to contain vulgar and sexually explicit posts, according to screenshots shared by two sources familiar with the Facebook pages.\n\nThe secret Facebook group, \"The Real CBP Nation,\" which has around 1,000 members, is host to an image that mocks separating migrant families, multiple demeaning memes of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, and other derisive images of Asians and African Americans.\n\nA meme posted to a second secret CBP facebook group. CNN obscured parts of this image to protect the privacy of those depicted.\n\nOne meme posted following her Monday visit to a Texas border station depicts a manipulated image of her gesturing toward a water fountain with the caption \"Is this a toilet?\" Following her visit, Ocasio-Cortez charged that people were drinking water from a toilet at the station, an accusation that acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has denied.\n\nCNN obtained the images after a report published earlier this week of another secret Facebook group, called \"I'm 10-15,\" for current and former Border Patrol agents that reportedly featured jokes about migrant deaths, derogatory comments about Latina lawmakers and a lewd meme involving at least one of them.\n\nA meme of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted in a secret group said to be for Customs and Border Protection employees. CNN has blurred the image and removed identifying material.\n\n\"Racism and sexism in the Border Patrol just doesn't belong,\" said the first source familiar with the images.\n\nThe existence of the group \"I'm 10-15\" was exposed by the investigative reporting group ProPublica. That Facebook group changed its name to \"America First,\" and then archived the page on Monday, preventing any additional posts or comments, according to a second source and a screenshot of the page.\n\nCNN has not been able to independently access and review either of the Facebook groups in question or verify how many group members in the private Facebook communities are or were affiliated with Customs and Border Protection.\n\nAn image of a secret CBP facebook group. CNN obscured parts of this image to remove identifying information.\n\nSome members of \"The Real CBP Nation\" Facebook group reacted to the shuttering of \"I'm 10-15\" in screenshots of posts and comments.\n\n\"Disappointed on (sic) all of you who abandoned ship,\" said one commenter, along with two laughing emojis.\n\nOn Tuesday, another group member wrote, \"Lost 7,000 members in a day. Impressive.\"\n\nAn additional comment said in part, \"We're in this till the end #pleasedontjicmeorcalloig,\" which appears to be a reference to the Joint Intake Center and the Office of Inspector General.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson told CNN on Friday that the company had removed content from the group that was in violation of the social network's policy.\n\n\"We have removed several pieces of content from the Group 'The Real CBP Nation' for violating our policies on Bullying and Harassment, Cruel and Insensitive content, and Sexual Exploitation of Adults. We believe in giving people a voice, but we also want everyone using Facebook to feel safe. That's why we have Community Standards and remove anything that violates them,\" said the spokesperson in a statement.\n\nIt was not clear when the content was removed.\n\nA spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection did not comment on the substance of the online postings, but said the new information obtained by CNN was referred to the Office of Professional Responsibility. It was not clear if Customs and Border Protection's internal investigative office already knew about the second Facebook group or the content that was posted.\n\nOn Friday, Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Matt Leas told CNN in a statement that the agency is \"investigating the posts to determine the facts.\"\n\n\"If the investigation verifies that employees posted content in violation of CBP's code of conduct, the findings will inform management decisions regarding appropriate disciplinary action. CBP does not tolerate misconduct on or off duty and will hold those who violate our code of conduct accountable. These posts do not reflect the core values of the agency and do not reflect the vast majority of employees who conduct themselves professionally and honorably every day, on and off duty,\" he added.\n\nOn Monday, Customs and Border Protection said it had immediately informed the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General and initiated an investigation following a media report revealing the existence of the Facebook group \"I'm 10-15.\"\n\nResponding to an inquiry about the \"I'm 10-15\" posts, Customs and Border Protection's assistant commissioner for the Office of Professional Responsibility, Matthew Klein, said in a statement Monday that those posts were \"hosted on a private Facebook group that may include a number of CBP employees.\"\n\nThe reports of possible social media misconduct this week prompted calls from agency leadership to hold anyone responsible for violating standards of conduct accountable.\n\n\"We take all the posts that were put out today very seriously. These do not represent the thoughts of the men and women of the US Border Patrol. Each one of these allegations will be thoroughly investigated,\" said US Border Patrol Chief of Operations Brian Hastings in an interview on \"Newsroom\" with CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Monday.\n\nThe issue is not new, however, for Customs and Border Protection. In 2018, a senior official warned all agency employees of potential discipline, after having been informed of a private Facebook group with inappropriate and offensive posts, according to a memo obtained by CNN.\n\n\"Recently the Agency was made aware of a private Facebook group page that only a specific group of CBP employee could access, on which inappropriate and offensive posts were made,\" Klein wrote.\n\nThe memo, dated February 2018 and titled \"Social Media Posts,\" did not identify a specific Facebook group but reminded employees of Customs and Border Protection's standards of conduct and anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies for workplace and off-duty employees that prohibit certain conduct on the grounds of discrimination or harassment.\n\nThis story has been updated to include statements from Facebook and Customs and Border Protection that were provided to CNN after publication.",

        "text": "McAllen, Texas (CNN) Vice President Mike Pence saw the overcrowded conditions facing migrant adults and children in Customs and Border Protection custody firsthand Friday, becoming the highest-ranking member of the Trump administration to visit two federal detention centers in Texas ahead of controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids targeting undocumented immigrants this weekend.\n\n\"To be honest with you, I was not surprised by what we saw,\" Pence told reporters Friday, citing the humanitarian crisis and congestion. \"This crisis is real, the time for action is now.\"\n\nJoined by a group of reporters, Senate Republicans and acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, Pence visited two facilities in the Rio Grande Valley: the Donna Processing Facility, temporarily housing families, and the McAllen Border Patrol Station, housing single adults who have been found crossing into the United States illegally.\n\nIn Donna, Pence saw oversized, air-conditioned facilities, with children and their parents lying on cots, watching animated movies and eating snacks.\n\nIn McAllen, it was a much different scene: Pence toured a swelteringly hot room called a sally port with hundreds of men, a strong smell of sweat and overcrowding so extreme there was no room for cots, the migrants left to sleep on concrete beneath mylar blankets.\n\n\"The Vice President's office specifically instructed CBP to not clean up or sanitize the facility beyond what is routine so the American people could see how serious the crisis at our border is (overcrowding, lack of resources, beds),\" an administration official said in an email, noting that there were Secret Service concerns over Pence entering the sally port, but the Vice President's office pushed for press access.\n\n'Time for Congress to act'\n\nAsked by CNN whether the conditions for the detained single adult immigrants were acceptable, Pence said no.\n\n\"No, it's not. That's the reason why we demanded that Congress provide $4.6 billion in additional support to Customs and Border Protection,\" the vice president said in an interview following both tours and a roundtable with Border Patrol officials. \"The McAllen station, where our cells are overflowing ... ought to be a very clear message to every American that the time for action is now and the time for Congress to act to end the flow of families that are coming north from Central America to our border is now.\"\n\nPence's visit comes ahead of Sunday's scheduled ICE raids targeting migrant families with court-ordered removals that had previously been called off by President Donald Trump. The upcoming ICE operation is expected to target approximately 2,000 people and take place over several days in major cities across the nation.\n\nAdvocacy groups have been hosting \"Know Your Rights\" trainings and circulating fliers and social medial posts with guidelines about what they say immigrants should do if ICE agents show up at their door.\n\nPence would not answer four repeated questions from CNN on whether the Sunday ICE raids will separate families.\n\n\"The upcoming efforts are going to focus exclusively on individuals who have been fully adjudicated and ordered by a judge to be deported,\" he said.\n\nPence said ICE will prioritize immigrants with deportation orders who have also committed crimes in the US, though he was vague on whether those who had not committed crimes could be targeted as well.\n\n\"These will be individuals who are facing a deportation order, and the priority that Homeland Security and ICE will be placing will be on those individuals that have also committed crimes in this country, and represent a threat to our communities,\" he said.\n\nIn McAllen, Pence did not engage directly with any of the men, but he did speak with some of the children and mothers in Donna, asking them if they were well cared for. They all nodded yes. Children told him their journey to the United States by foot took two and three months. In Donna, there were rooms filled with health supplies, snacks and changes of clothes for the migrants, many of whom had arrived at the facility with shoes and pants crusted in mud from the journey.\n\nDonna was one of the facilities built to accommodate the recent large increase of family crossings. Standing in a supply room in front of a wall stacked with Kool-Aid Jammers, Pence asked officials whether the children in custody are receiving adequate meals and snacks. They answered affirmatively. The level of care at Donna hasn't necessarily been the case for children at other facilities.\n\nYazmin Juarez, a mother whose toddler died weeks after they were released from ICE custody in 2018, recalled the death of her child in emotional testimony before a House panel Wednesday.\n\n\"I watched my baby girl die, slowly, and painfully, just a few months before her second birthday,\" she said through an interpreter, later beginning to cry recounting her 19-month-old daughter being admitted to the ICU.\n\nAnd in testimony from Elora Mukherjee, attorney and Clinical Professor of Law at Columbia Law School, at a House Oversight Committee hearing on the border on Friday, Mukherjee said that in her interviews with hundreds of immigrant children and families that many children in custody are embarrassed to use the toilets because \"they are open\" and have no privacy.\n\n\"In Clint, we talked to girls who were so embarrassed that boys could see them while they were using the toilet,\" she said. \"We talked to a boy who tried not to eat because he was so embarrassed to use the toilet.\"\n\nVice President Mike Pence visited the McAllen Border Patrol Station in McAllen, Texas on July 12, 2019\n\n'This isn't human'\n\nThe men in the sally port in McAllen told CNN they had been in Customs and Border Protection custody for more than 40 days. They said they hadn't had access to showers or toothbrushes. They yelled before reporters that they were hungry.\n\n\"This isn't human. I'm not a terrorist,\" one man said.\n\nPatrol agent in charge Michael Banks disputed some of those characterizations. He said a trailer with showers had arrived Thursday, though it was possible some of the men had not bathed yet. He said there were 88,000 disposable toothbrushes on site and that the migrants got three hot meals a day from local restaurants. He said the space, which, despite the heat, does have air-conditioning, was cleaned three times a day. He said none of the migrants had been there longer than 32 days.\n\nThe trip came weeks after unannounced inspections of Border Patrol facilities by an internal Department of Homeland Security watchdog found extreme overcrowding and children younger than 7 being held in custody for longer than two weeks -- far more than the allotted 72 hours -- among other \"urgent\" issues discovered. The watchdog found additional violations of detention policy, such as a lack of hot meals, inadequate access to showers and limited access to a change of clothes.\n\nAdditionally, images of squalid conditions and thinly stretched resources found in news reports and congressional Democrats' descriptions of their own visits have captured the nation's attention.\n\nPence said there should be the \"same standard of care\" for both families and single adults, defending the disparate conditions.\n\n\"What you saw today was a very clean facility where people were being detained indoors, and then you saw a temporary facility that was constructed because this facility is overcrowded. And we can't keep people in a cell beyond what the rules and regulations allow for, but everyone in that temporary facility is getting health care, they're getting hygiene and the Customs and Border Protection is doing their level best in an overcrowded environment and a difficult environment to address this issue, but Congress has got to act,\" he said.\n\nThe images of the vice president walking through the Donna facility Friday stand in stark contrast to photographs of overcrowded conditions facing families with children by DHS inspector general just weeks before. Overcrowded conditions have eased considerably following the movement of most migrant children to Health and Human Services facilities thanks to new funding from Congress. There was a 28% drop in numbers of migrants apprehended at the border in June, in part due to the season, but also, Pence said, because of support from Mexico.\n\nPence said he had read the report, but added, \"I can't account for that,\" when pressed by CNN about images of conditions similar to those of the McAllen facilities for families with children featured in the DHS inspector general's report.\n\n\"The facility you saw today represents the level and the standards of care that we are working to bring to all those caught up in this crisis. Remember, it was just a few short weeks ago that Congress finally acknowledged the crisis and gave us an additional $4.6 billion in humanitarian aid. Now we're going to continue to improve, we're going to continue to provide care at the standard the American people expect,\" he said, calling on Congress to overhaul asylum laws and close what he characterized as legal loopholes.\n\nOfficials say the overcrowding among children has largely been alleviated because of the supplemental funding that Congress just passed . As a result, most have been moved out within the 72-hour time limit to HHS facilities.\n\nThough Pence's office also extended invitations to Senate Democrats for the Friday visit, none were in attendance, underscoring the highly politicized situation as the humanitarian crisis at the US-Mexico border unfolds. A group of congressional Democrats will tour the area on Saturday.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii had told CNN on Thursday that she did not want to be part of a politicized trip.\n\n\"I don't want to participate in what is basically the Trump show, the Trump-Pence show. What do you think they are going to see? You have a President saying, 'Everything's just fine. These facilities, these detention centers are just being run great.' Yeah, that's what they're going to see. But we know from all of the reports that things are not great,\" she said.\n\nHirono continued, \"Believe me, when any of us visit, they will make sure that they see what they want us to see. And that's not real.\"",

        "text": "(CNN) In 2018, a senior Customs and Border Protection official warned all agency employees of potential discipline after having been informed of a private Facebook group with inappropriate and offensive posts, according to a memo obtained by CNN.\n\n\"Recently the Agency was made aware of a private Facebook group page that only a specific group of CBP employees could access, on which inappropriate and offensive posts were made,\" wrote Matthew Klein, assistant commissioner of CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility,\n\nThe memo, dated February 2018 and titled, \"Social Media Posts,\" reminded employees of CBP's standards of conduct, anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies for workplace and off-duty employees that prohibits certain conduct on the grounds of discrimination or harassment.\n\n\"The bottom line is the Agency may bring discipline against an employee who posts offensive messages on a social media page where there is a nexus to the Agency workplace,\" reads the memo.\n\nThe discovery of the memo comes amid an investigation into a closed Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents that reportedly features jokes about migrant deaths, derogatory comments about Latina lawmakers and a lewd meme involving at least one of them. The Facebook group was publicly reported on this week and Klein called it \"disturbing social media activity.\"\n\nRead More",

CNN has not been able to independently access and review the Facebook group posts in question.\n\nIt is not clear how many group members are or were affiliated with the Border Patrol.\n\n\"We take all the posts that were put out today very seriously. These do not represent the thoughts of the men and women of the US Border Patrol. Each one of these allegations will be thoroughly investigated,\" said US Border Patrol Chief of Operations Brian Hastings in an interview on \"Newsroom\" with CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Monday.\n\nThe posts were turned over the the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General, as well as CBP's internal affairs office to begin the investigations, added Hastings.\n\nProPublica claims it was able to link the participants in those online conversations to apparently legitimate Facebook profiles belonging to Border Patrol agents. Neither ProPublica nor CNN have been able to reach group members who made the postings.\n\nProPublica reports that the Facebook group's page boasts 9,500 members and says it was formed in 2016. It is unclear from the reporting how many members claim to be active agents. Posts feature comments about the death of a teen Guatemalan migrant in Weslaco, TX such as \"oh well\" and \"if he dies he dies.\"\n\nAnother post encourages members to protest Monday's border visit by Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Veronica Escobar, saying they should \"throw a 10-15 burrito\" at them. A meme posted on the group site depicts Ocasio-Cortez in a lewd act with a detained migrant, according to ProPublica.\n\nProPublica reports that, in another thread, a group member suggests the photo of drowned migrant father and daughter could have been faked because the bodies were so \"clean.\" \"I have never seen floaters like this,\" the poster reportedly wrote, adding \"could this be another edited photo. We've all seen the dems and liberal parties do some pretty sick things...\"\n\nA statement from US Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost said, \"These posts are completely inappropriate and contrary to the honor and integrity I see — and expect — from our agents day in and day out. Any employees found to have violated our standards of conduct will be held accountable.\"\n\nThe report inspired outrage from Democrats in Congress.\n\nResponding to the ProPublica report, Rep. Joaquin Castro, the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, tweeted: \"These agents don't deserve to wear any uniform representing the United States of America.\"\n\nIn another tweet, Ocasio-Cortez decries a \"racist & sexually violent secret CBP Facebook group. They're threatening violence on members of Congress.\"\n\nOn her way out of the Clint Border Patrol facility in El Paso on Monday, she told CNN , \"In the last facility, I was not safe from the officers.\"\n\nIn response, Hastings told CNN that he would tell Ocasio-Cortez, \"Ma'am, we are professionals. We are dealing with a crisis right now. Over 680,000 apprehensions so far this year. Agents are under a great deal of stress.\"\n\nHe reminded the public of how many rescues the men and women of the Border Patrol have done and \"put their life on the line to save various individuals throughout the year.\"\n\nEscobar told CNN, \"It's obviously not acceptable for anyone to threaten a member of Congress.\"\n\nShe added, \"I'm more concerned that there are men and women, people in Customs and Border Protection and DHS, who feel this way about migrants, especially children.\"\n\nEscobar said she could not be certain that all the members of the group were linked to federal law enforcement, but did say they speak to a broader group of people.\n\n\"It could be civilians or spouses of agents,\" she said. \"I can say with certainty that they represent a lot of hate out there against people like me who advocate for the dignity of human beings.\"\n\nHouse Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said the report points to \"clear and systemic problems that must be addressed immediately,\" within DHS and CBP.\n\n\"This Facebook group is beyond sexist and racist -- it is truly abhorrent and shameful, and there is no excuse for this depraved behavior,\" Thompson said. \"The agents found to be responsible for these vile comments should no longer have the privilege of representing the United States of America in uniform.\"\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit news organization that produces investigative journalism.",

        "text": "(CNN) In 2018, a senior Customs and Border Protection official warned all agency employees of potential discipline after having been informed of a private Facebook group with inappropriate and offensive posts, according to a memo obtained by CNN.\n\n\"Recently the Agency was made aware of a private Facebook group page that only a specific group of CBP employees could access, on which inappropriate and offensive posts were made,\" wrote Matthew Klein, assistant commissioner of CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility,\n\nThe memo, dated February 2018 and titled, \"Social Media Posts,\" reminded employees of CBP's standards of conduct, anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies for workplace and off-duty employees that prohibits certain conduct on the grounds of discrimination or harassment.\n\n\"The bottom line is the Agency may bring discipline against an employee who posts offensive messages on a social media page where there is a nexus to the Agency workplace,\" reads the memo.\n\nThe discovery of the memo comes amid an investigation into a closed Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents that reportedly features jokes about migrant deaths, derogatory comments about Latina lawmakers and a lewd meme involving at least one of them. The Facebook group was publicly reported on this week and Klein called it \"disturbing social media activity.\"\n\nRead More",

Any employees found to have violated our standards of conduct will be held accountable.\"\n\nThe report inspired outrage from Democrats in Congress.\n\nResponding to the ProPublica report, Rep. Joaquin Castro, the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, tweeted: \"These agents don't deserve to wear any uniform representing the United States of America.\"\n\nIn another tweet, Ocasio-Cortez decries a \"racist & sexually violent secret CBP Facebook group. They're threatening violence on members of Congress.\"\n\nOn her way out of the Clint Border Patrol facility in El Paso on Monday, she told CNN , \"In the last facility, I was not safe from the officers.\"\n\nIn response, Hastings told CNN that he would tell Ocasio-Cortez, \"Ma'am, we are professionals. We are dealing with a crisis right now. Over 680,000 apprehensions so far this year. Agents are under a great deal of stress.\"\n\nHe reminded the public of how many rescues the men and women of the Border Patrol have done and \"put their life on the line to save various individuals throughout the year.\"\n\nEscobar told CNN, \"It's obviously not acceptable for anyone to threaten a member of Congress.\"\n\nShe added, \"I'm more concerned that there are men and women, people in Customs and Border Protection and DHS, who feel this way about migrants, especially children.\"\n\nEscobar said she could not be certain that all the members of the group were linked to federal law enforcement, but did say they speak to a broader group of people.\n\n\"It could be civilians or spouses of agents,\" she said. \"I can say with certainty that they represent a lot of hate out there against people like me who advocate for the dignity of human beings.\"\n\nHouse Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said the report points to \"clear and systemic problems that must be addressed immediately,\" within DHS and CBP.\n\n\"This Facebook group is beyond sexist and racist -- it is truly abhorrent and shameful, and there is no excuse for this depraved behavior,\" Thompson said. \"The agents found to be responsible for these vile comments should no longer have the privilege of representing the United States of America in uniform.\"\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit news organization that produces investigative journalism.",

We've all seen the dems and liberal parties do some pretty sick things...\"\n\nA statement from US Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost said, \"These posts are completely inappropriate and contrary to the honor and integrity I see — and expect — from our agents day in and day out. Any employees found to have violated our standards of conduct will be held accountable.\"\n\nThe report inspired outrage from Democrats in Congress.\n\nResponding to the ProPublica report, Rep. Joaquin Castro, the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, tweeted: \"These agents don't deserve to wear any uniform representing the United States of America.\"\n\nIn another tweet, Ocasio-Cortez decries a \"racist & sexually violent secret CBP Facebook group. They're threatening violence on members of Congress.\"\n\nOn her way out of the Clint Border Patrol facility in El Paso on Monday, she told CNN , \"In the last facility, I was not safe from the officers.\"\n\nIn response, Hastings told CNN that he would tell Ocasio-Cortez, \"Ma'am, we are professionals. We are dealing with a crisis right now. Over 680,000 apprehensions so far this year.

Sign up for ProPublica’s Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published. Leer en Español.\n\nMembers of a secret Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents joked about the deaths of migrants, discussed throwing burritos at Latino members of Congress visiting a detention facility in Texas on Monday and posted a vulgar illustration depicting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with a detained migrant, according to screenshots of their postings.\n\nGet Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nIn one exchange, group members responded with indifference and wisecracks to the post of a news story about a 16-year-old Guatemalan migrant who died in May while in custody at a Border Patrol station in Weslaco, Texas. One member posted a GIF of Elmo with the quote, “Oh well.” Another responded with an image and the words “If he dies, he dies.”\n\nCreated in August 2016, the Facebook group is called “I’m 10-15” and boasts roughly 9,500 members from across the country. (10-15 is Border Patrol code for “aliens in custody.”) The group described itself, in an online introduction, as a forum for “funny” and “serious” discussion about work with the patrol. “Remember you are never alone in this family,” the introduction said.\n\nA screenshot from the Facebook group, run with this text: “That's right bitches. The masses have spoken and today democracy won. I have returned. To everyone who knows the real me and had my back I say thank you. To everyone else? This is what I have to say.....”\n\nResponsible for policing the nation’s southern and northern boundaries, the Border Patrol has come under intense scrutiny as the Trump administration takes new, more aggressive measures to halt the influx of undocumented migrants across the United States-Mexico border. The patrol’s approximately 20,000 agents serve under the broader U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, which has been faulted for allegedly mistreating children and adults in its custody. The agency’s leadership has been in turmoil, with its most recent acting chief, John Sanders, resigning last week.\n\nProPublica received images of several recent discussions in the 10-15 Facebook group and was able to link the participants in those online conversations to apparently legitimate Facebook profiles belonging to Border Patrol agents, including a supervisor based in El Paso, Texas, and an agent in Eagle Pass, Texas. ProPublica has so far been unable to reach the group members who made the postings.\n\nProPublica contacted three spokespeople for CBP in regard to the Facebook group and provided the names of three agents who appear to have participated in the online chats. CBP hasn’t yet responded.\n\n“These comments and memes are extremely troubling,” said Daniel Martinez, a sociologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson who studies the border. “They’re clearly xenophobic and sexist.”\n\nThe postings, in his view, reflect what “seems to be a pervasive culture of cruelty aimed at immigrants within CBP. This isn’t just a few rogue agents or ‘bad apples.’”\n\nA screenshot showing the title of the Facebook group, left, and the description.\n\nThe Border Patrol Facebook group is the most recent example of some law enforcement personnel behaving badly in public and private digital spaces. An investigation by Reveal uncovered hundreds of active-duty and retired law enforcement officers who moved in extremist Facebook circles, including white supremacist and anti-government groups. A team of researchers calling themselves the Plain View Project recently released a hefty database of offensive Facebook posts made by current and ex-law enforcement officers.\n\nAnd in early 2018, federal investigators found a raft of disturbing and racist text messages sent by Border Patrol agents in southern Arizona after searching the phone of Matthew Bowen, an agent charged with running down a Guatemalan migrant with a Ford F-150 pickup truck. The texts, which were revealed in a court filing in federal court in Tucson, described migrants as “guats,” “wild ass shitbags,” “beaners” and “subhuman.” The messages included repeated discussions about burning the migrants up.\n\nA screenshot of one of the posts in the Facebook group.\n\nSeveral of the postings reviewed by ProPublica refer to the planned visit by members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, including Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Veronica Escobar, to a troubled Border Patrol facility outside of El Paso. Agents at the compound in Clint, Texas, have been accused of holding children in neglectful, inhumane conditions.\n\nMembers of the Border Patrol Facebook group were not enthused about the tour, noting that Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from Queens, had compared Border Patrol facilities to Nazi concentration camps. Escobar is a freshman Democrat representing El Paso.\n\nOne member encouraged Border Patrol agents to hurl a “burrito at these bitches.” Another, apparently a patrol supervisor, wrote, “Fuck the hoes.” “There should be no photo ops for these scum buckets,” posted a third member.\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing posts target Ocasio-Cortez. One includes a photo illustration of her engaged in oral sex at an immigrant detention center. Text accompanying the image reads, “Lucky Illegal Immigrant Glory Hole Special Starring AOC.”\n\nAnother is a photo illustration of a smiling President Donald Trump forcing Ocasio-Cortez’s head toward his crotch. The agent who posted the image commented: “That’s right bitches. The masses have spoken and today democracy won.”\n\nA screenshot from the Facebook group.\n\nThe posts about Escobar and Ocasio-Cortez are “vile and sexist,” said a staffer for Escobar. “Furthermore, the comments made by Border Patrol agents towards immigrants, especially those that have lost their lives, are disgusting and show a complete disregard for human life and dignity.”\n\nThe head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Joaquin Castro, reviewed the Facebook discussions and was incensed. “It confirms some of the worst criticisms of Customs and Border Protection,” said Castro, a Democrat who represents San Antonio. “These are clearly agents who are desensitized to the point of being dangerous to migrants and their co-workers.” He added that the agents who made the vulgar comments “don’t deserve to wear any uniform representing the United States of America.”\n\nRead More Investigation of Secret Border Patrol Group Launched as New Degrading Facebook Posts Surface A ProPublica story revealing demeaning posts directed at Latina lawmakers prompted widespread revulsion. Immigration officials said such comments violate the agency’s code of conduct and promised that violators will be held accountable.\n\nVicki Gaubeca, director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition, said the postings are more evidence of the sexism and misogyny that has long plagued the Border Patrol. “That’s why they’re the worst at recruiting women,” said Gaubeca, whose group works to reform the agency. “They have the lowest percentage of female agents or officers of any federal law enforcement agency.”\n\nIn another thread, a group member posted a photo of father and his 23-month-old daughter lying face down in the Rio Grande. The pair drowned while trying to ford the river and cross into the U.S.; pictures of the two have circulated widely online in recent days, generating an outcry.\n\nThe member asked if the photo could have been faked because the bodies were so “clean.” (The picture was taken by an Associated Press photographer, and there is no indication that it was staged or manipulated.) “I HAVE NEVER SEEN FLOATERS LIKE THIS,” the person wrote, adding, “could this be another edited photo. We’ve all seen the dems and liberal parties do some pretty sick things…”\n\nHelp Us Investigate People Are Using Secret Facebook Groups To Spread Hate We Can’t See. We Need Your Help.

        "text": "(CNN) Rep. Terry Canales heard the reports of children suffering in squalid conditions at Customs and Border Protection facilities and knew what he had to do.\n\nThe Texas state legislator sent a letter to local Border Patrol officials asking what items members of the public could donate.\n\nCanales says the response he received baffled him. \"We don't accept donations,\" the email from a Border Patrol representative said, according to Canales.\n\n\"It just befuddles me and I think it's just heartbreaking to know that there's so many people that want to help, and that help is being denied for no definable reasons that anybody's been able to communicate,\" Canales told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nThe United States Border Patrol has responded, telling my office they do no accept donations. How ridiculous is this? #DontGetMeStarted https://t.co/ZpzGRHtq2D\n\nTwo people who attempted to donate items at a Texas facility this week also told CNN their items weren't accepted.\n\nThe situation, first reported by The Texas Tribune , has left would-be donors scratching their heads and drawn criticism from Canales and others who accuse the federal government of letting red tape get in the way of human decency.\n\nWhy wouldn't the agency accept donations? CBP officials said Tuesday that they aren't running low on supplies, but are looking into whether they can accept donations in the future. And a former CBP official told CNN it would be illegal for the agency to accept donations from the public.\n\nHere's a deeper look at the issues in play:\n\nCBP: 'We're not running low on those things'\n\nOn a call with reporters Tuesday, a CBP official said that the agency is working with its lawyers to see whether it can accept donations in the future.\n\nAsked about reports that donations of hygiene products were not being accepted by CBP, the official said the agency isn't running low on such supplies.\n\n\"We're using operational funding to provide those things. But those things are available now and they have been continuously,\" he said. \"So we are looking at the possibility of using some of those donations going forward. But those items, it's important to note, are available now.\"\n\nGabriel Acuña says he bought toothpaste, toothbrushes and soap that he wanted to give to kids in the custody of US Customs and Border protection, but wasn't able to donate them.\n\nLast week a team of doctors, lawyers and advocates warned of what they said were major health and hygiene problems at several CBP facilities in Texas. Members of the team of monitors told CNN the conditions they witnessed were \"unconscionable,\" noting a lack of soap and restrictions on how often children could shower.\n\nSeparately, a Justice Department lawyer argued last week that detained migrant children don't need toothbrushes, soap and blankets in order to be held in \"safe and sanitary conditions,\" as a court settlement requires.\n\nBoth the monitors' findings and widely circulated reports of the Trump administration's recent legal argument have spurred widespread criticism -- and increased interest in donating items to kids in US government custody.\n\nA CBP official told reporters Tuesday that the agency takes any allegations of abuse seriously, but also cautioned that some allegations the monitors raised are vague and difficult to investigate.\n\n\"We have made significant investments in humanitarian care,\" the official said, adding that agents in the field should be commended for going out of their way to care for infants. The high numbers of migrants crossing the border is a crisis, the official said, \"and we're doing the best we can do deal with it.\"\n\nFormer CBP adviser: Accepting donations would be illegal\n\nTheresa Cardinal Brown says there's one clear reason why CBP wouldn't be accepting donations.\n\n\"The short answer is it's against the law,\" says Brown, who worked for CBP as a policy adviser from 2005-2007 and now is the head of immigration and cross-border policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington.\n\nThe law in question, Brown says, is known as the Antideficiency Act\n\n\"That law is a law passed by Congress that says the government cannot accept goods and services without remuneration. Because it cannot spend or use things that have not been appropriated to it by Congress,\" Brown said. \"If (CBP) was able to accept donations outside of that it would be overspending what it was authorized to spend.\"\n\nIn addition, Brown said ethical considerations would come up \"if the executive gets to decide from whom it gets to accept donations and for what.\"\n\nShe cited the recent example of a GoFundMe border wall fundraiser , which began as an effort to raise money to donate to CBP.\n\n\"The government could not accept that money for a border wall because it would be a donation,\" she said.\n\nWould-be donors say when they went to Border Patrol facility's door, no one answered\n\nGabriel Acuña headed to the dollar store and stocked up on supplies to donate over the weekend.\n\nBut he was surprised to see there was no one at the Border Patrol facility in his hometown of Clint, Texas, to accept the bars of soap, tubes of toothpaste and packets of toothbrushes he'd purchased. The door was locked, he said, and the lobby was empty.\n\nGabriel Acuña says he wrote a note that he left with toothpaste and other items he wanted to donate to kids in US government custody.\n\n\"Obviously the community wants to help out,\" Acuña told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Tuesday. \"Let the community get involved, if anybody higher up in terms of the administration or likewise in government is not able to do so.\"\n\nAustin Savage says he and a group of friends had a similar experience when they went to the Clint facility over the weekend with diapers and other supplies they'd brought to donate.\n\n\"The facility itself was shut down. We rang the intercom buzzer, to no response, and we called the help line posted on the window, to no response. The only activity was vehicles moving in and out from the facility through an electronic sliding gate,\" he said. \"The agents in the vehicles saw us, clearly, and in some cases stopped the vehicle to stare back, but no one interacted with us.\"\n\nAustin Savage says he and a group of friends tried to donate diapers and other supplies at a Border Patrol facility in Texas, but no one answered the door.\n\nLawmaker: Any policy and security reasons 'can be overcome'\n\nCanales said he spoke with Border Patrol representatives this week, but wasn't given an explanation as to why donations weren't being accepted.\n\n\"We had a semi-productive conversation with respect to what was happening, and the (Rio Grande sector) chief seemed to be receptive to trying to come to some sort of arrangement wherein he could accept donations. So the lines of communication are open,\" Canales said. \"But the reality is Border Patrol is overwhelmed, and whether they've got the monetary funding to provide the resources and whether they can provide the resources are two different things.\"\n\nThe federal government, he said, has been too slow to act.\n\n\"To say that you don't have the adequate resources, yet we're going to turn down resources that are being offered for free, is derelict,\" he said. \"I understand there can be some policy reasons and security reasons, but these reasons can be overcome.\"",

That area is the busiest sector for arrests on the southern border.\n\nThe report includes several photos that depict the extreme overcrowding, as well as standing-room-only conditions in some Border Patrol facilities, which are designed to be temporary holding facilities. However, over the past several months the length of time in custody has grown amid the ongoing influx of migrant families and children who turn themselves in to agents at the southern border.\n\nFor example, at the Centralized Processing Center in McAllen, Texas -- the main location for unaccompanied children in the region -- 165 children had been in custody longer than a week.\n\nInvestigators also found that, according to US Border Patrol custody data, roughly 30% of minors at the inspected facilities were held longer than the 72 hours permitted, including some children under 7 who had been held for more than two weeks awaiting transfer to Department of Health and Human Services custody.\n\nRead More",

        "text": "(CNN) Weeks ago, as President Donald Trump warned that ICE agents were preparing raids across the country , a 41-year-old housekeeper and babysitter in Miami headed to the grocery store with her daughter.\n\nThey knew they'd be staying inside and needed to stock up on supplies.\n\n\"I felt that day like it was a hurricane coming,\" the undocumented immigrant from Nicaragua told CNN.\n\nSince then, the raids Trump threatened haven't happened . But for millions of undocumented immigrants living across the United States, the storm is still brewing.\n\nWith a new threat of immigration raids on Sunday , immigrant rights advocates and undocumented immigrants told CNN that fear in their communities is growing.\n\nAnd undocumented immigrants are bracing themselves.\n\nThey're calling hotlines, afraid to go outside and unsure of where to turn. Some are staying home from work. Others are posting signs by doors inside their homes telling them what to do if ICE agents show up.\n\nShe woke up last night, screaming\n\nWhile the uneasy mix of panic and preparation weeks ago felt like a hurricane, there was one notable difference for the housekeeper in Miami. The store in her neighborhood seemed eerily empty. Already, she said, people were afraid to go out.\n\nShe returned home with a plan.\n\n\"I said, 'OK, you know what, we're going to keep the windows down, the blinds down. I don't want any noise. I want everybody to stay calm and try to turn off the lights in the living room, so if they come, they don't know that we are in the house,'\" she said. \"I know my rights. I know that I don't have to open the door. I know a lot of things, but even with that it's really scary.\"\n\nThe woman shared her story with CNN but asked to be identified only by a pseudonym, Elena, out of fear she could face repercussions for speaking out. She said she came to the United States more than two decades ago on a visa, which she overstayed as she sought asylum.\n\nElena lost her case but stayed in the United States, where she says she's built a life and grown her family. She's terrified of being separated from them.\n\n\"This is a horrible feeling,\" she said Thursday. \"These past two days, I've been waking up in the middle of the night. My husband says, 'What happened to you last night? You started screaming in your dream.'\"\n\nA man is detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on October 14, 2015, in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFrightened farm workers are staying home\n\nÉlfido García sat in the scorching sun Thursday tending to agave plants in Homestead, Florida. For weeks, he's been picking up extra work to fill in for colleagues who he says are too scared to leave home after hearing about the possibility of raids on TV.\n\nThe migrant worker from Guatemala says he only leaves home to walk to work, knowing that along the way he risks the possibility of arrest by authorities.\n\n\"Yes, I'm taking the risk,\" he said, \"but just to fight for my family.\"\n\nAs the threat of immigration raids looms in South Florida, fields once filled with workers look empty. Weeds are popping up where crops once grew. And the number of \"help wanted\" signs posted offering work are on the rise.\n\nA growing number of workers are scared to leave their homes, leaving farm owners in search of laborers to harvest their crops.\n\nFarm owner Gustavo Serna told CNN en Español that crops are being lost as a result.\n\n\"Because of the lack of workers, many times people are losing up to 50% of their harvest,\" he said.\n\nAcross the country, in Worthington, Minnesota, an undocumented agriculture worker who spoke with CNN said the community there is terrified, too. He said he's planning to hunker down all weekend until he is certain ICE agents aren't in the streets.\n\n\"I don't want to leave my family devastated,\" he said, \"so we are just going to stay inside.\"\n\nÉlfido García says he's been hunkering down at home as reports of possible immigration raids resurface. He only leaves to walk to work.\n\nQuestions and frantic calls\n\nAdvocates note that fears of deportation are familiar in immigrant communities across the country. And this isn't the first time raids have been threatened or reported on before they occur.\n\nBut this time around, many advocates say the concerns they're hearing from immigrants are more intense.\n\n\"There is a lot of panic and a lot of fear, even though we know that these raids happen every year. ... Something feels tangibly different this time around,\" said Nayim Islam, an immigrant rights organizer for Desis Rising Up & Moving, an advocacy group that works with South Asian and Indo-Caribbean communities in New York City.\n\nMany groups have set up hotlines for community members to report raids and reach out for help.\n\n\"We got a call from a mom who said that her little girl wasn't feeling well and she was afraid to go to the doctor. She was trying to figure out how to make it there,\" said Melissa Taveras, a spokeswoman for the Florida Immigrant Coalition.\n\n\"We keep getting calls and messages from folks, saying, 'We're scared. What should we do?'\" Taveras said. \"I've seen those sorts of messages and calls more than usual, which really worries me, because those are people that are preparing in fear.\"\n\nAcross the country, advocacy groups have been hosting \"Know Your Rights\" trainings and circulating fliers and social medial posts with guidelines about what they say immigrants should do if ICE agents show up at their door.\n\nThe word seems to have gotten out, said Abel Nuñez, executive director of the Central American Resource Center in Washington.\n\n\"A lot of people have heard that message,\" he said. \"I think the question is, if it does happen to them, are they going to implement it? It's one thing for me to give you a card or a paper with your rights. It's another thing at five in the morning, when you hear a loud knock at your door and someone's yelling, ' Police!' Are you going to let them in? That's a very different environment.\n\n\"At this point, it's just about repetition, reminding them of what they have, so that it's muscle memory.\"\n\n'This is not a life'\n\nNow that another ICE operation appears to be imminent, Elena says she doesn't want to risk staying home to find out what would happen if federal agents show up at her door.\n\n\"This week we're planning to move out for a week until this stops, but next month we're going to move from the apartment,\" she said. \"I've been in that apartment for five years now, so I don't think it's secure.\"\n\nFear, she says, has become a constant. She's so exhausted that sometimes she wishes she could go back to Nicaragua.\n\nBut she says recent unrest there has made her scared to return to the country she left decades ago.\n\n\"Sometimes I feel that way. I want to say...'I give up. I'm going back.' Because this is not a life. ... I'm driving. I have no driver's license.\n\n\"My daughter sometimes says, 'Mom, I'm scared you're not going to come back home,'\" Elena says. \"I don't know if I'm going to get the opportunity to feel that I have a free life, that I live in peace.\"",

Despite the drop, this June was much higher than the same time last year, when there were 34,089 apprehensions.\n\nThe numbers are in line with forecasts from acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, who said Friday that it appeared there would be a 25% decrease in June numbers of migrants crossing at the US-Mexico border.\n\nA dip in border crossings is common during the hot summer months, though McAleenan downplayed the role of seasonal trends in migration, saying that he expects to be able to tell by late July if initiatives undertaken by the US and Mexico governments will have a sustained impact.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection does not comment on unofficial numbers, according to a spokesperson. The agency generally releases final monthly numbers towards the beginning of the subsequent month.\n\nRead More",

        "text": "(CNN) Immigration and Customs Enforcement is scheduled to move forward with an operation targeting migrant families with court-ordered removals that had previously been called off by President Donald Trump, according to a US official.\n\nICE, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, is charged, in part, with deporting undocumented immigrants. A senior immigration official told CNN that the details of the ICE operation, currently slated to start on Sunday, will be largely the same as the one postponed last month.\n\nThe New York Times first reported on the upcoming raids , saying they are expected to take place in at least 10 cities. The raids will occur \"over multiple days\" and will include \"collateral\" deportations in which \"authorities might detain immigrants who happened to be on the scene, even though they were not targets of the raids.\"\n\nWho is targeted and why\n\nThe migrant families expected to be targeted recently arrived to the US.\n\nIn February, ICE sent around 2,000 letters to families who already had received final orders of removal by judges in absentia, asking them to self-report to local ICE offices by March to comply with the orders.\n\nThe upcoming operation is expected to target approximately 2,000 people, according to a senior immigration official.\n\nLast year, the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the nation's immigration courts, announced that it had begun tracking family cases filed by the Department of Homeland Security in 10 immigration court locations and those cases are being expedited to try to process the families in under a year.\n\nThen-acting ICE director Mark Morgan said last month that ICE had worked closely with the Justice Department on the family expedited docket and that the \"results were very disappointing,\" claiming that some families haven't attended their immigration hearings.\n\nWhere the raids are expected to take place\n\nThe senior immigration official tells CNN that the operation is expected to target some 2,000 family members with court orders of removal and take place over several days in 10 cities across the nation -- Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York and San Francisco.\n\nThe city of New Orleans said on Twitter that it confirmed with ICE that \"immigration enforcement will be temporarily suspended through the weekend\" in areas of Louisiana and Mississippi impacted by tropical storm Barry.\n\nWhat happens to those who are arrested?\n\nThere are additional legal steps that migrants could take in the event that they're arrested, therefore it's unlikely that all those targeted would be immediately deported.\n\nIn some cases, for example, an individual may be ordered removed because he/she didn't show up to their immigration court hearing. If the reason the individual didn't appear is because they weren't provided notice of the date, time and place of their immigration hearing, that individual could file a motion to reopen their case.\n\nOthers could file a motion to reopen if conditions have deteriorated in their home country since the date they were ordered deported.\n\nTrump has so far deported fewer people than Obama\n\nAccording to Immigration and Customs Enforcement statistics, 256,085 people were deported in fiscal year 2018, up from 226,119 removals in fiscal year 2017.\n\nThat's still significantly less than the number of people deported during fiscal year 2012, when the Obama administration deported more than 400,000 people.\n\nStaffing limitations and budget constraints generally limit how many people the US can detain and deport -- and how quickly that process happens. While the Trump administration has said it still focuses on criminals, there was an uptick in the number of people arrested by ICE without criminal records. Crossing the border illegally is a misdemeanor.\n\nIn Trump's first year, ICE arrested 109,000 criminals and 46,000 people without criminal records -- a 171% increase in the number of non-criminal individuals arrested compared to 2016.\n\nCNN first reported in May that the administration had been considering deporting migrant families with court-ordered removals in an attempt to \"send a message\" to smugglers, according to a senior administration official.\n\nAs part of the consideration, the administration had been looking at an operation rolled out in the late years of Obama's presidency -- and revived in Trump's first year in office -- that also targeted families.\n\nIn 2017, ICE apprehended 650 individuals during a four-day operation, dubbed Operation Border Guardian/Border Resolve, which targeted families and unaccompanied children. According to the agency, it was the second iteration of the operation which had also taken place at the start of 2016 following an uptick in families and unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally.\n\nSimilar to the upcoming ICE operation, all individuals had court-ordered removals.",

        "text": "(CNN) Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, grew emotional during a news conference Thursday recalling the photos of the father and young daughter who drowned crossing the Rio Grande, as well as the conditions she saw children facing at the migrant detention centers on the Southern border.\n\n\"When you saw the pictures of the kids at these detention facilities. When you saw the father, the little girl drowned in the Rio Grande. And if you didn't feel shame, pain. If you weren't appalled by these pictures, then something is dead or dying in your hearts and in the heart of America,\" Hirono said at the news conference to introduce the bill \"Stop Cruelty to Migrant Children Act.\"\n\nSenate Democrats say the legislation introduced Thursday seeks to provide additional guardrails and standards for migrant children and families two weeks after Congress passed the border supplemental, which was criticized by many Democrats for not doing enough to protect migrants. As Democrats are in the minority in the chamber, it's unclear whether Republicans will pick up the legislation.\n\nThe photo Hirono referenced was of Oscar Alberto Martinez and his daughter , identified by officials from El Salvador as Angie Valeria M., who drowned in the currents of the Rio Grande late last month as they tried to slip into the United States. The image of the father and his daughter lying face down in the water drew international attention for illustrating the humanitarian crisis at the border.\n\nHirono was part of a group of Democrats to introduce the new bill Thursday that included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, Assistant Senate Minority Leader Patty Murray and Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon.\n\nRead More",

His resignation is effective July 5.\n\nActing Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Mark Morgan is expected to take over as Customs and Border Protection in an acting capacity, according to a Department of Homeland Security official.Sanders's resignation as acting head of CBP comes amid a crush of migrants at the border that has overwhelmed facilities. Earlier Tuesday, CBP held a call with reporters on squalid conditions at a Border Patrol facility in Clint, Texas\n\nOfficials conceded that children should not be held in CBP custody, noting that the agency's facilities were designed decades ago to largely accommodate single adults for a short period of time.\n\nOver the weekend, President Donald Trump called off planned raids by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying deportations would proceed unless Congress finds a solution on the US-Mexico border within two weeks. Before it was postponed, Mark Morgan had publicly confirmed an operation targeting migrant families and others with court-ordered removals was in the works.\n\nMorgan, a vocal proponent of the President's efforts, was another of Trump's picks to lead ICE after abruptly pulling the nomination of Ron Vitiello.\n\nMorgan briefly served as Border Patrol chief during the Obama administration before leaving the post in January 2017. He previously spent two decades at the FBI. He is expected to return to Customs and Border Protection, which encompasses Border Patrol.\n\nSanders assumed the post after Kevin McAleenan, the former commissioner, moved up to fill the role of acting homeland security secretary in the wake of Kirstjen Nielsen's ouster this spring. In his role, Sanders has overseen the agency responsible for policing the US borders and facilitating legal trade and travel. It is also the frontline agency dealing with the surge of migrants at the southern border.\n\nRobert Perez, the highest-ranking career official, is the current deputy commissioner. It is unclear if he will step into the acting commissioner position.\n\nBefore becoming acting commissioner, Sanders, served as the Chief Operating Officer at CBP, where he worked with McAleenan to address the operational needs of the agency and work on strategic direction.\n\nAs of June 1 this fiscal year, Border Patrol has arrested more than 377,000 family units, over 60,000 unaccompanied children, and over 226,000 single adults.\n\nSanders did not provide a reason for his departure.\n\nRead Sanders's letter here:\n\nAs some of you are aware, yesterday I offered my resignation to Secretary McAleenan, effective Friday, July 5. In that letter, I quoted a wise man who said to me, \"each man will judge their success by their own metrics.\" Although I will leave it to you to determine whether I was successful, I can unequivocally say that helping support the amazing men and women of CBP has been the most fulfilling and satisfying opportunity of my career.\n\nI've spent a significant amount of time over the last several days reflecting on my time at CBP. When I began this journey, Commissioner McAleenan charged me with aligning the mission support organizations and accelerating his priorities. Easy enough, I thought. What I didn't appreciate at the time was how the journey would transform me professionally and personally. This transformation was due in large part to the fact that people embraced and welcomed me in a way that was new to me -- in a way that was truly special. To this day, I get choked up when speaking about it and I can't adequately express my thanks. As a result, let me simply say I will never stop defending the people and the mission for which 427 people gave their lives in the line of duty in defending. Hold your heads high with the honor and distinction that you so richly deserve.\n\nThroughout our journey together, your determination and can-do attitude made the real difference.

I therefore encourage everyone to reflect on all that you have accomplished as a team. My hope is you build upon your accomplishments and embrace new opportunities, remain flexible, and continue to make CBP extraordinary. This is your organization...own it! Don't underestimate the power of momentum as you continue to tackle some of this country's most difficult challenges.\n\nI will forever be honored to have served beside you.

Sign up for ProPublica’s Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published.\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency has opened an investigation into vulgar and misogynistic social media posts made by members of a secret Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents.\n\nOn Monday, “U.S. Customs and Border Protection was made aware of disturbing social media activity hosted on a private Facebook group that may include a number of CBP employees,” said Matthew Klein, head of the agency’s internal affairs unit.\n\nKlein said CBP “immediately informed” the investigators with the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General and initiated an inquiry. The office typically takes the first look at allegations of serious misconduct within the CBP.\n\nGet Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nThe investigation comes after a ProPublica report exposing the secret three-year-old Facebook group, which is called “I’m 10-15” and has some 9,500 members. Group members posted offensive graphics, including a photo illustration of Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez being sexually assaulted by President Donald Trump; discussed plans to disrupt a congressional visit to a Border Patrol facility; and joked about the deaths of migrants.\n\nRecent posts shared with ProPublica include a meme using graphic language to mock CNN anchor Anderson Cooper’s sexual orientation and a comment that referred to soccer star Megan Rapinoe as a man. A separate thread made fun of a video of a migrant man trying to carry a child through a rushing river in a plastic bag.\n\nOne poster wrote, “At least it’s already in a trash bag.”\n\nAnother wrote, “Sous-vide? Lol,” referring to a method of cooking in a bag.\n\nKlein said CBP’s code of conduct bars employees from making hateful and abusive statements on social media.\n\nThe group’s posts were also condemned by Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost.\n\nA screenshot of a post from the Facebook group, left, with comments.\n\n“These posts are completely inappropriate and contrary to the honor and integrity I see — and expect — from our agents day in and day out,” she said in a statement. “Any employees found to have violated our standards of conduct will be held accountable.”\n\nThe disclosure of the group’s existence and the nature of the posts raise a number of questions that remain unanswered. It’s apparent from some of the comments that agents were aware that the posts were inappropriate, and potentially actionable, for serving government employees. But it’s unclear whether CPB’s senior leadership was aware of the group or if any complaints had been made to the agency.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the leader of a key oversight committee expressed outrage.\n\n“This Facebook group is beyond sexist and racist — it is truly abhorrent and shameful, and there is no excuse for this depraved behavior,” said Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, one of the committees with jurisdiction over CBP. “The agents found to be responsible for these vile comments should no longer have the privilege of representing the United States of America in uniform.”\n\nThe story generated widespread revulsion on social media, with more than a dozen members of Congress expressing horror and disgust at the posts. Some called for an investigation into the group.\n\nOne of the targets of the offensive posts, Ocasio-Cortez, responded several times on Twitter.\n\nThis just broke: a secret Facebook group of 9,500 CBP officers discussed making a GoFundMe for officers to harm myself & Rep. Escobar during our visit to CBP facilities & mocked migrant deaths.\n\n\n\nThis isn’t about “a few bad eggs.” This is a violent culture. https://t.co/SkFwThHElx — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 1, 2019\n\nThe union representing Border Patrol employees, the National Border Patrol Council, issued a statement saying that the Facebook group is “not representative of our employees and does a great disservice to all Border Patrol agents, the overwhelming majority of whom perform their duties admirably.”\n\nProPublica’s reporting, the union said, “cited a handful of people who posted inappropriate content out of 9,500 members of the Facebook group, not all of whom are active active duty agents.”\n\nBut CBP insiders told ProPublica that the Facebook group has played host to offensive memes and degrading humor since it was launched in 2016.\n\n“The problems with the 10-15 page have been going on for years,” said one current Border Patrol agent who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. “No one has done anything about it.”\n\nRead More Inside the Secret Border Patrol Facebook Group Where Agents Joke About Migrant Deaths and Post Sexist Memes The three-year-old group, which has roughly 9,500 members, shared derogatory comments about Latina lawmakers who plan to visit a controversial Texas detention facility on Monday, calling them “scum buckets” and “hoes.”\n\nThe agent said that during the 2016 election, group members wrote up homophobic posts attacking an openly gay agent who voiced support for Hillary Clinton. “Nobody seemed to care,” recalled the agent.\n\nFormer Border Patrol agent Jenn Budd, who is now an immigrant-rights activist, told ProPublica that language like “floaters” — used to refer to the bodies of drowned migrants in a post about the widely shared Associated Press photograph of a father and daughter who died crossing the Rio Grande last week — is “normal, everyday terminology.”\n\n“That’s as normal as saying ‘10-15,’” Budd said, referring to the code for a migrant in custody that the Facebook group uses as its name. Budd said that degrading comments about women were also endemic to Border Patrol, whose workforce as of 2017 was only 5% female.\n\nBudd said she had little faith that CBP really intends to investigate its own.\n\n“When they sit there and say, ‘We’re not going to tolerate this,’” Budd said, “they are, I’m just going to say it, lying.”\n\nRevelations about the group came the day after Facebook released an audit of its efforts to protect civil rights across the social media platform. The audit specifically recommended strengthening protections against hate speech and calls for harassment related to national origin.\n\nA screenshot from the Facebook group.\n\nHeidi Beirich, the director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said she’d been pressing Facebook to pursue secret groups like 10-15 and hidden hate speech for years. Facebook, she said, “can use their AI or their people to identify these groups, and with the horrible language in there, they should have been finding these people.”\n\nFacebook has not yet responded to questions from ProPublica.\n\nSome members of the Facebook group predicted there would be trouble if the posts ever became public. “A bunch of people gonna regret comments they write on 10-15 if it shows up in court,” wrote one member in a post obtained by ProPublica.\n\n“You understand this page is full of Agents, right?” replied another member, apparently suggesting that no one would expose the offensive comments of their fellow Border Patrol employees.\n\nHelp Us Investigate People Are Using Secret Facebook Groups To Spread Hate We Can’t See.

        "text": "Despite expanding rapidly over the past two decades, federal law enforcement agencies remain almost as male-dominated as they were during the Clinton administration, according to a new POLITICO survey — the first to assess the gender gap in federal law enforcement in nearly a decade. In 1996, women held about 14 percent of the country’s federal law enforcement jobs; today, women represent just 15 percent. At this rate, it will be 700 years before women hold half of these jobs.\n\nFrom Customs and Border Protection to the Secret Service, large agencies are trundling along in a sort of time machine, with men dominating the ranks in ways they no longer do across the rest of government or even many large police departments. On a percentage basis, there are now more female members of Congress than female officers at the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe lowest ratio of all belongs to the Border Patrol. Just 5 percent of its agents are female, which means the Border Patrol employs fewer women than the U.S. Marines (at 8 percent). The active-duty military has three times as many women as the Border Patrol, on a proportional basis (at 16 percent).\n\nThere is no conclusive evidence that women are any better or worse at policing than men. Some studies have shown that women are less likely to be involved in police shootings or to prompt a complaint from civilians, but most of those studies are dated and the sample sizes are very small. As most cops will tell you, training and supervision matter more than biology, and the variation between individuals is much greater than between genders.\n\nBut there is reason to believe that a law enforcement agency that does not remotely resemble the population it serves risks losing the trust of those people. Since last year’s presidential election, Hillary Clinton and others have accused former FBI Director James Comey of bowing to pressure from the bureau’s conservative New York City field office when he reopened an investigation into her private-server emails days before the election. Some critics noted that the claim might be easier to dismiss if FBI agents were not 80 percent male and 80 percent white.\n\nBeyond symbolism, these imbalances also raise questions about the competence of these agencies. At the most obvious level, female agents are needed to do invasive searches of women — a not-uncommon occurrence at the border in particular (and one reason why Israel’s Border Guard Police has nearly 25 percent women). In other agencies, female officers are critical for undercover work. Most importantly, any organization that fails to engage half the population in its hiring is leaving behind serious talent.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, given the agency's paltry percentage of female agents, the Border Patrol’s newest acting chief is a woman — for the first time in the agency’s 93-year history. Carla Provost is a veteran agent who commands respect up and down the ranks, and has vowed to do better. “There’s more we can do to recruit women,” she told POLITICO in an interview in her office in Washington this fall. “The more women, the more African-Americans, the more different groups — it just makes us better.”\n\nAgents who don’t fit the stereotype can defuse tense situations, she says. “There’s a different approach when a female agent comes onto the scene,” Provost says. “I experienced this myself. In stressful situations, sometimes it’s a calming effect.” But the agency’s history suggests change will be difficult. When Provost started as a new agent 22 years ago, the Border Patrol had 5 percent women — the same ratio it has today.\n\nBorder agent Denisse Licon patrols the fence along the U.S.-Mexico border. Just 5 percent of Border Patrol agents are female. | Reena Flores/POLITICO\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, the most gender-balanced outfits include federal probation and pretrial services, whose officers are perfectly balanced at 50 percent women, as well as IRS special agents and various offices of inspectors general, which boast 28 percent women or more. But at the largest federal law enforcement agencies, the percentages of women have barely changed since the last such survey, conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2008.\n\nComing at a time when the Department of Justice has been urging local police departments to diversify their own ranks, this enduring imbalance is ironic — and a little mysterious.\n\nOverall, the federal government is unusually equitable when it comes to gender. Women hold 43 percent of the jobs and more than a third of the leadership roles. Female government executives actually earn slightly more than their male counterparts.\n\nIt’s no surprise that more men go into law enforcement than women, but that doesn’t explain why the San Diego and Detroit police departments have more women on a percentage basis than the FBI. There seems to be something uniquely intractable about federal law enforcement, suggesting a problem beyond the simple math of gender equality. Combined, federal law enforcement agencies represent a police force almost three times the size of the New York City Police Department, with vast powers to arrest and detain civilians. The more skewed their demographics, generally speaking, the less effective they will be.\n\n“I do think people want the government to look like them,” says Julie Myers Wood, former head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement under President George W. Bush. “On the cases I worked, sometimes the strongest agents were men and sometimes women. It’s the mixture that’s valuable. We’re enforcing all of our laws.”\n\nEarlier this year, President Donald Trump issued executive orders directing the Department of Homeland Security to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents and 10,000 more immigration officers. Given these agencies’ longstanding troubles attracting and onboarding qualified candidates, they would need to persuade more than a million Americans to apply just to get anywhere near those goals, according to a July report from the Department’s Office of the Inspector General. Given past application rates, the chances of reaching those numbers before the hiring window ends in 2019 are virtually zero.\n\nBut there is nothing inevitable about the dearth of women in law enforcement. After surveying more than 40 agencies and interviewing current and former law enforcement officers of a variety of ranks, POLITICO has identified specific ways that departments could attract and retain more female officers, should they truly desire to do so.\n\nThe best lessons come not from federal agencies but from the most country’s most innovative municipal police forces. These departments are years ahead of many federal agencies, not just in their hiring but in their philosophy. They operate in different contexts, but they share the same fundamental problem: You cannot protect a community that will not talk to you.\n\n“I honestly don’t think policing will have any chance of reclaiming lost ground or winning new hearts unless we are making an all-out blitzkrieg to incorporate diversity within our ranks,” says Michael Koval, the police chief of Madison, Wisconsin, where women have made up about 30 percent of the ranks for at least 17 years — one of the highest rates in the country. “Unless we can truly, authentically create a workforce that is reflective of our community, I think we will continue to slip and slide and lose whatever ground we may currently enjoy.”\n\nTrouble on the border\n\nAs a computer science student at the University of Texas at El Paso, Erika King had never considered working for the Border Patrol. Then, one day 15 years ago, she met a recruiter at a career day fair who told her the Border Patrol was looking for more women. She started imagining a very different life for herself. “I felt like I had been going to school forever,” she says, and she missed being outside. “I was never really the type of girl to wear dresses and want to play with Barbies. I wanted to play in the dirt and ride my bike.”\n\nAt the Border Patrol’s training academy, then located in Charleston, South Carolina, she discovered that the agency was even more male-dominated than her computer science classes — and cultivated a very specific culture.\n\n“The Border Patrol is paramilitary,” King says. The recruits ran in cadence; they polished their boots and their brass and presented themselves for inspection; they got screamed at by their instructors and tried to avoid making eye contact. The Border Patrol is not a military organization, but it often acts like it is — one of the many reasons for the agency’s yawning gender gap. Individuality is discouraged. Men cannot have beards, and women with longer hair must wear it up in a tight bun. But King found she liked the camaraderie and structure that the academy fostered, and she felt a growing sense of pride in the work she would do.\n\n“I see the difference it makes whenever we’re processing a family group or females,” Border Patrol agent Erika King says. “They’re more willing to open up to us as females, to tell us things they probably wouldn’t divulge to a male agent.” | Reena Flores/POLITICO\n\nTo join, female recruits have to meet the same physical standards as the male recruits — a point that King and other female agents stressed was non-negotiable. If there had been a double standard, they might not have been prepared for the job, they say, and it would have been far harder to overcome the doubts of men in their organization. But the Border Patrol’s physical challenges, which include scaling a 6.5-foot wall, do not necessarily match up to the actual job tasks. And once agents pass, they never have to take the fitness test again — suggesting the ordeal may be as much a hazing ritual as it is a test of job readiness.\n\nAfter she passed her fitness, Spanish and academic tests, King returned to El Paso to begin her new career. Once she was out on patrol, parked in her agency-issued vehicle on the levee overlooking the Rio Grande River on the edge of Mexico, King found out that the hardest part of the job was managing boredom. “Believe it or not, it is physically and mentally taxing to sit in a vehicle for up to 10 hours a day,” she says. “You need to try and keep yourself busy.”\n\nKing’s first job is to listen: to the dispatcher, who calls out the numbers of motion-detector sensors, hidden in the sand, that have been tripped by fleeing migrants; for the sounds of dogs barking in backyards, sometimes a sign there’s a stranger in someone’s backyard.\n\nTo pass the time, she also listens to “This American Life,” the “TED Radio Hour” and other podcasts. To stay alert, she sometimes goes on short hikes in the desert near her posting, watching out for cacti and snakes and looking for footprints. She tries to stay out of the sun and drink water — but not too much water. There are few places for a woman to go to the bathroom discreetly on the El Paso border without a camera watching, and agents are not allowed to leave their posting.\n\nAbout once a shift, she hears something. And in that second, King’s job is to transform: to go from listening to chasing, at an all-out sprint sometimes, and then, just as quickly, from chasing to rescuing. A good Border Patrol agent must be able to quickly distinguish a man searching for work from a man smuggling drugs. The shift from humanitarian relief to combat can happen without warning, requiring agility that’s as much mental as physical.\n\nThe Border Patrol’s rhetoric focuses on its counterterrorism mission, a popular way to attract resources and prestige in the modern age, but most agents will never encounter anyone associated with terrorism. The vast majority of migrants are looking for work or fleeing violence or both. They tend to be worn down from the journey, and most surrender immediately. “For the most part, they are embarrassed,” King says. “They know they’re breaking the law.”\n\nON THE BORDER: El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez in Mexico are separated by the Rio Grande river – and the U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Below right, notes appear on a wall at the advocacy center. | Reena Flores/POLITICO\n\nBeing a female agent in this environment is a blessing and a curse, depending on the day. A critical part of King’s job is to gather information — to find out whether the migrant is afraid to return to his or her country and is applying for amnesty; to learn who the “coyote” is and how much he was paid to smuggle the group across the border; to find out whether a woman has been sexually assaulted on the journey. “I see the difference it makes whenever we’re processing a family group or females,” King says. “They’re more willing to open up to us as females, to tell us things they probably wouldn’t divulge to a male agent.”\n\nThis intelligence gathering is something that the Border Patrol as a whole does not do very well, according to researchers and immigration advocates who have witnessed these conversations or read the resulting paperwork. When agents fail to communicate, they can miss opportunities to pursue bigger cases against human traffickers, document forgers and drug smugglers — or, more often, they can doom a migrant’s legal case.\n\n“That interview is crucial,” says Linda Rivas, managing attorney at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso. “That’s kind of [migrants’] first chance at proving to the U.S. government that they are to be believed.”\n\nComing from more traditional Latin American cultures, some migrants trust female agents more — while others underestimate them. King remembers finding birth control pills in one woman’s purse, and the woman’s quiet explanation that they were for her 12-year-old daughter, sitting nearby. The mother said that she’d known the girl might be raped on the perilous journey to America, so she had taken precautions — a desperate pragmatism that King has never forgotten.\n\nAnother time, a woman at a processing center would not allow any of the male agents to hold her infant so she could fill out the paperwork. When she saw King, she handed the baby over without question. King does not, in fact, have any children, but she took the baby and played her part — a common story told by female law enforcement officers. Rightly or wrongly, people see female cops differently than male cops, and those optics matter.\n\n\n\nOn other days, King’s job has been made more difficult by her gender. When women or minorities make up a very small percentage of any industry, they stand out. They are tokens, a term Harvard Business School professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter coined in the 1970s. They do not have the critical mass to change the culture, so they must fit into it. But they are seen as so strange and exotic that they can never really blend in.\n\nMore than once, King says, she has been assaulted or otherwise toyed with because she was a female agent. One day, while she was apprehending a group of six undocumented migrants in El Paso, patting them down for weapons and handcuffing their wrists, one of the men bolted into the distance. She suspected he had smuggled the group across, and she spent the rest of the day in pursuit. That night, he tripped a sensor, and King snuck up on him in the darkness on the side of the I-10 freeway.\n\n“Why did you run?” she asked.\n\n“Because you’re a girl,” he said, “and you weren’t gonna catch up to me.”\n\n“Well, this girl caught you,” she replied.\n\nTelling this story, King shakes her head, embarrassed for both of them. “Then he actually started flirting, and he tells me, ‘If I would’ve known you were this pretty, I wouldn’t have run.’”\n\nHidden barriers\n\nThree years ago, facing a surge of women and children crossing the border from Central America, the Border Patrol did something unprecedented to try to recruit more female agents. The agency got special permission from the Office of Personnel Management to run a special, women-only recruitment campaign. They posted ads asking for women “to protect American interests and secure our Nation while building a meaningful and rewarding career,” and local and national media outlets ran stories about the effort.\n\nIn 10 days, 4,800 women applied to the agency, suggesting the initiative was a success. But of all those women, only 33 — or less than 1 percent — were actually hired.\n\nAt the Border Patrol Museum in El Paso, a poster celebrates the first woman accepted into the agency. | Reena Flores/POLITICO\n\nWhen asked what happened to the 99 percent of applicants who did not make it, Border Patrol officials, including acting Chief Provost, referred questions to Assistant Commissioner Linda Jacksta, who oversees human resources management for Customs and Border Protection. Through her spokesperson, Jacksta declined to be interviewed. Her office, via email, explained that “CBP does not track gender-specific ‘drop out’ information during the hiring process,” citing federal regulations prohibiting such monitoring. But according to the Office of Personnel Management, there is no regulation preventing agencies from retroactively analyzing hiring decisions to try to understand where biases might exist. To the contrary, “OPM encourages agencies as part of their annual barrier analysis to review applicant, hiring and employee data for trends or outcomes related to different demographic groups,” according to an OPM spokesperson. Looking at this data could help reveal when and why women are falling out of the Border Patrol’s pipeline, but it appears CBP does not conduct this analysis, due to a misreading of federal regulations.\n\nAround the same time as the women-only job announcement, the agency also set up a working group to study the concerns of women in the Border Patrol. Deputy Chief Gloria Chavez participated in this process and found it to be productive, leading, for example, to a better mentorship program for women across CBP. “Does the Border Patrol benefit from having women? The answer is absolutely yes,” says Chavez, who has been with the agency for 22 years and now oversees the law enforcement operations directorate. “I find it brings a sense of balance.”\n\nWhen asked to share the after-action reports from this effort, however, a Border Patrol spokesperson responded that the document was “internal.”\n\nIn the past several years, the agency has tried to do a better job targeting women, visiting women’s colleges like Spelman in Atlanta and Smith in Northampton, Massachusetts, as well as female athletic competitions, including the Big Ten Women's Basketball Tournament. But it has simultaneously increased its efforts to recruit military veterans who can speed through the application process faster under federal rules that give preference to veterans in government hiring.\n\nOn one level, this approach makes sense, since many veterans have some of the same skills required of agents. But veterans also tend to be disproportionately male. And the Border Patrol is not, after all, a military outfit. Indeed, its history suggests it needs to cultivate a more varied skill set.\n\nAccording to an independent review conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum in 2013, Border Patrol agents have repeatedly taken unnecessarily aggressive actions that put agents and civilians in harm’s way. The last time the Border Patrol went on a hiring spree, after 9/11, the agency ended up employing people who should never be trusted with a badge, including drug cartel members. As POLITICO has chronicled in the past, agents have shot and killed at least 46 people since 2004. The agency has released almost no information about disciplinary measures taken in response. From 2005 to 2012, CBP officers were arrested for various kinds of misbehavior at the rate of almost one per day, according to a 2012 Government Accountability Office report.\n\nBorder Patrol trainee Stevany Shakare, 24, takes part in a weapons training class at the U.S. Border Patrol Academy on Aug. 3, 2017, in Artesia, New Mexico.

But through its hiring practices and its culture, the agency still gives preference to agents who act more like soldiers than guardians, and it will be hard to attract more women — and different kinds of men — with that mind-set in place.\n\nTo witness its efforts to diversify, CBP invited POLITICO to a recruitment event at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina, this fall. It was an informative event, with spirited, uniformed recruiters who explained the process clearly and handed out Border Patrol pens and water bottles. But Camp Lejeune is a Marine Corps base — not a place you’d naturally think to go to find women. Of the 14 attendees at the day’s two sessions, only one was female.\n\nIn all of 2016, CBP held 4,400 recruitment events. Of those events, 26 percent targeted veterans and 5 percent targeted women. Those ratios are almost exactly the same as the ratios of veterans and women in the Border Patrol overall. Not coincidentally, an outfit that talks mostly to men ends up being mostly male.\n\nSome of the Border Patrol’s other problems with recruiting and retaining women cannot be easily fixed. Joining up requires relocating for four months to the agency’s residential academy in a remote part of New Mexico — a requirement that is impossible for most single parents to meet (and an approach that most police departments have moved away from). Like other federal law enforcement agencies, the Border Patrol also requires agents to move if they want to be promoted up the ranks — a disruptive mandate that can discourage women, who still tend to take on a majority of child care obligations.\n\n“We’re not a standard police department,” Provost says. “You’re asking people to pick up and move to a little border town that maybe doesn’t have good school systems. We’re asking people to work night shifts in the desert, by themselves.”\n\nGiven these constraints, Provost tries to be realistic. “I don’t ever see our numbers being huge,” she says. She would like to reach 10 percent women, she says, but does not offer a timeline for achieving that goal.\n\nIt is easy to believe that the Border Patrol’s leadership would like to hire more women; it is hard to believe it is a priority, particularly since CBP, which oversees the hiring, does not analyze basic information that could help officials learn how to do better. In an email, CBP noted that more than 20 percent of new hires last year were female — helping to boost the percentage of female agents a little less than 1 percentage point. But of all those newly hired female agents, only 86 percent are still there — versus 92 percent of male agents. If CBP officials know why that is or how it could be improved, they are not saying.\n\nA different view of policing\n\nOne way to glimpse how the Border Patrol and other federal law enforcement agencies might change if they had more women is to observe a department that has already made this transformation.\n\nThis fall, POLITICO visited one of the most gender-diverse police departments in America. The Madison, Wisconsin, police department has had about 30 percent women since at least 2000, when it began keeping digital records. That is a magic number, according to research on group behavior: At around 25 percent to 30 percent, women reach critical mass and can begin influencing the culture of an organization instead of just trying to conform to it.\n\nA few days before Halloween, Madison Police Officer Natalie Deibel put her long brown hair in a pony tail, pulled on her bulletproof vest, checked out a rifle and climbed into her department-issued SUV for her evening shift. Madison is a small city of a quarter of a million people, perched between two large lakes and home to the state capital and the University of Wisconsin’s flagship campus. The city has problems with drug and alcohol use and a rising violent crime rate but fewer than a dozen homicides a year.\n\nNatalie Deibel, a police officer in Madison, Wis., sits in her cruiser earlier this month. A third of Deibel’s class was female; this year’s class is 37 percent female. | Darren Hauck/ For POLITICO Magazine\n\nNothing about Deibel fit the stereotype for a cop. She was relentlessly cheerful, for one thing. And she was wearing purple sunglasses featuring tiny cat faces, for another. “It’s one way to connect with people, and it also, frankly, is a benefit investigatively,” Deibel explained, laughing. When people see a female cop wearing ridiculous sunglasses, it disrupts their narrative about cops in general. Her earrings, featuring Leslie Knope from “Parks and Recreation,” served the same purpose: to render her less like a cop and more human. “I can’t do my job if people don’t tell me things. So to me, it’s a no-brainer.”\n\nBefore becoming a police officer three years ago, Deibel worked as a teacher and then attended graduate school. Right before joining the department, she was working, improbably enough, on a Ph.D. dissertation on 17th century gender, class and ethnic power structures in the American colonies.\n\n“What I found is that I missed people,” Deibel says. She’d spent time volunteering with nonprofits that help victims of sexual assault, where she got to see how some police officers interacted with victims. “I saw victims being retraumatized by police officers who, simply because of their lack of life experience or a lack of training, did not [show] that level of compassion that I wanted to be there for those victims.”\n\nDeibel read about the Madison Police Department’s focus on diversity and cold-called the recruiting sergeant (now the chief). He asked about her research, sounding genuinely curious, and he encouraged her to submit her application.\n\nMadison’s Police Academy is the opposite of the Border Patrol Academy in almost every way. It is not residential; recruits go there for eight hours a day and then go home. “I don’t want our people eating, living, sleeping, cop shop 24/7,” says Chief Koval, “because that’s just a reinforcement of the sort of dichotomy of, ‘us versus them.’ We don’t want them to get caught up in this cop culture that is so insidious.”\n\n\n\nOfficers repeatedly described the academy as a “collaborative adult learning space,” using literally those words. It sounded less like a boot camp than a wellness center. “I found my academy experience to be very warm, empathetic place where people’s experiences were valued right away,” Deibel says.\n\nIf recruits are struggling with a certain class or skill, they get extra help. If they fail the pre-academy fitness test, they can now take it again a few months later. A third of Deibel’s class was female, and those recruits remain among her closest friends. This year’s class is 37 percent female.\n\n“We just aren’t militaristic,” says Mary Schauf, Madison’s captain of training. “It doesn’t work for us. We treat them like we want them to treat our community, and I don’t want them to treat our community like militaristic robots.”\n\nOver the years, Koval has found ways to target women and all kinds of atypical candidates. “We’re not looking for recovering Navy SEALs or U.S. Rangers,” he says. “We’re looking for critical thinkers, people who are empathetic, good communicators, great at crisis intervention.” The department has 20 percent minority officers, roughly mirroring the local population. Every year, the department sends a wave of recruitment letters to the coaches of female sports teams at universities around the Midwest, proven talent pools for the department. In July, the department helps run CampHERO, a two-week program to introduce girls to emergency services — including lessons in rappelling and handcuffing stuffed animals.\n\n“I honestly don’t think policing will have any chance of reclaiming lost ground or winning new hearts unless we are making an all-out blitzkrieg to incorporate diversity within our ranks,” says Michael Koval, the police chief of Madison, Wis., where women have made up about 30 percent of the ranks for at least 17 years — one of the highest ratios in the country. | Darren Hauck/For POLITICO Magazine\n\nThe applicants who tend to fare the worst are the ones from the military or other police departments, Koval says. During the interview process, when asked to explain their vision of law enforcement, they tend to talk only about enforcing the laws. “They don’t talk about the dimensions of the social work that are very, very real for us,” Koval says. “Enforcement of the law is about 20 percent of what we do. The other 80 percent is a lot of relational stuff, a lot of mediation, diagnostics, referral — a lot of collaboration that has nothing to do with law enforcement. Nothing.”\n\nIn interviews with a dozen of Madison’s 461 police officers, all of them spoke about policing in the same, unusual way. They talked about “connecting” with victims, witnesses and suspects, and making themselves “vulnerable” in order to build trust. Policing sounded more like speed dating than law enforcement, to hear them tell it.\n\nUpon arriving at a crime scene, explains Detective Lt. Paige Valenta, officers need to figure out what happened. They need, as she puts it, someone to “make eye contact.” Then they can start to talk, which changes everything. But here’s the thing: It’s hard to predict who will get eye contact. Sometimes it’s the female officer, and sometimes it’s not. Maybe it’s the African-American officer with a goatee. That’s why police need to come in different varieties, she says. To increase the odds of connecting. “It's very important to have a lot of different people to make eye contact with.”\n\nDuring one four-hour period with Deibel, she went out on several calls, all of which involved different levels of eye contact. First, there was a large and profoundly inebriated man wearing cargo shorts, a black puffy jacket and one red sock, whom she was able to calm down almost immediately.\n\n“I wasn’t even doing nothing,” the man protested after she approached him on a street corner downtown.\n\n“Actually, three people called us on their way home from work, worried about you,” Deibel said in a loud, animated voice, not unlike a teacher talking to a child. “They were afraid you were walking into traffic.”\n\n“Oh, I’m sorry,” the man said.\n\n“What’s going on with the drinking?” Deibel asked, handing him her card.\n\n“My sister died,” the man said. “My friend died. Everybody’s dying. My daughter almost died.”\n\n“Is there someone you talk to? What’s your daughter’s name? Don’t close your eyes.”\n\nTWO SIDES OF THE JOB: Top, Madison Police Officer Natalie Deibel leads a handcuffed, inebriated man to a patrol car. Below, she checks out a trick-or-treater's candy stash. | Reena Flores/POLITICO\n\nWhile the conversation went on like this, another officer searched the man’s name on his laptop and discovered that he was violating the rules of his probation by drinking. He walked back and swiftly handcuffed the man, who was now calm, thanks to Deibel. As the man was led to a patrol car, he slowly turned Deibel’s card over and over in his hands, now cuffed behind his back. The officers emptied his pockets of coins and a fidget spinner, leaving him with only the card in his possession, on his way to jail.\n\nBut then, an hour later, when she was called to check out a semi-conscious man lying in the door of a downtown business, Deibel was not able to connect. The man, also intoxicated and passing in and out of consciousness, did not want to talk to her. She tried to calm him down and ask him questions, and it did not work. “Shut up, bitch. I don’t want to talk to you,” he yelled repeatedly.\n\nDeibel let another officer — a male — do more of the talking. Then she helped the other officers get the man into a patrol car so that he could be taken to a detox facility to sleep it off. “That was actually like the nicest profanity I’ve heard this week,” Deibel commented.\n\nWhile the Border Patrol does a very different job than the Madison Police Department, both organizations need to communicate with the public, work as unified teams and attract qualified people to do difficult and sometimes dangerous work. Their jobs require intelligence-gathering, problem-solving and social-service work, not just marksmanship and arrest tactics. Different kinds of people can bring more creative solutions to bear. Notably, female officers in Madison (and other, larger departments including New York City) report using force in their encounters with the public less often than male officers.\n\nWhat Madison chiefs have learned over the years is that diversity needs to be a priority from the top down through the department. “It absolutely starts from the top,” says Assistant Chief Susan Williams, who has spent 29 years at the department. “You won’t have a department that embraces diversity unless that is something that is absolutely supported and emphasized by the chief.” Otherwise, without that continuous counterpressure, a police department will revert to homogeneity, Williams says. And that would make the job much harder, says Koval. “How would I look if we had 400 white guys with bad haircuts like me? It would be very hard to build those relationships if everyone had the same life experiences.”\n\nSusan Williams, assistant chief of police of the Madison Police Department, has spent 29 years at the department. “It absolutely starts from the top,\" she said. \"You won’t have a department that embraces diversity unless that is something that is absolutely supported and emphasized by the chief.” | Darren Hauck/For POLITICO Magazine\n\nAnother key lesson is that the academy needs to be a place where nontraditional recruits fit in. Otherwise, white men will be the most likely to persist, explains Training Team Lt. Marianne Flynn Statz. “When you automatically belong, you're not aware that you feel like you belong when you walk in a room. Women don't necessarily feel like that,” she says. That’s why it’s so important to offer people second chances if, say, they fail the fitness test. “When you make that invite, ‘Come on back,’ it says, ‘You belong here. You have a chance. We want you here.’”\n\nFinally, the entire organization needs to shift from a warrior to a guardian mind-set, an evolution that has been slow in coming to most municipal departments, let alone federal agencies. “We unapologetically market ourselves as social workers in uniform,” says Koval. That approach turns off some gung-ho recruits, he concedes, and that is the idea.\n\n“I can teach a monkey how to shoot a Glock,” he says. “The cerebral skills, the relational skills, that is the elusive commodity that you have to search for if you really want to be true guardians.”\n\nThe work continues, even in Madison. There are currently no women on the SWAT team. The chief and his three assistant chiefs are all white. The city has paid out millions of dollars in civil cases related to at least three police shootings of civilians in recent years (though no criminal liability has been found). “We’re still experiencing the same issues many departments are,” Koval says. “We’re a constant work in progress.\"\n\nTrying to reach a critical mass\n\nOutside of Madison, Wisconsin, female officers do not, generally speaking, like to talk about their gender. When asked about it, most get a pained expression on their faces. They’ve spent their careers trying to transcend gender.\n\n“I didn’t want to be known as the ‘first woman.’ I wanted to be known as someone selected by my merit,” says Jan Fedarcyk, who retired in 2012 as the first woman to lead the FBI’s New York field office, overseeing 2,000 agents. “You have to prove yourself constantly, and there’s a smaller margin of error. You want to be recognized as competent.”\n\nMost high-ranking women had generous and career-changing mentors who were men. “The FBI was great to me,” says Kristy Kottis, who retired in 2014 after leading the Threat Response Squad of the Joint Terrorism Task Force in the New York office. “If it was not for fine, level-headed men, who do not see gender, I wouldn’t be where I was.”\n\nOne day, hopefully, more officers will not “see” gender — or will at least see it differently. But when the gender imbalance is extreme, as it is in most federal agencies, it can cause all manner of distortions, some of which are hard to talk about openly.\n\nAt one large federal agency, for example, women who are promoted are routinely assumed by rank-and-file agents to have “slept their way to the top,” according to a female agent who asked that her name be withheld out of concern for her job. That kind of talk creates a perverse incentive, making women think twice about how a promotion will be perceived, she says.\n\nTo build camaraderie, female agents keep many of their true feelings to themselves, like other minorities in the profession. And it’s not just a matter of fitting in; law enforcement agents need to rely upon each other as a matter of life and death, so trust trumps justice. “You don't want to be that female,” the agent says. “Where all the guys are like, ‘Shh, don't say anything around her because she's gonna get you in trouble.’ I don't want to be that girl. I want them to trust me and feel comfortable around me.”\n\nRecruit Chelsea Wetjen of the Madison Police Department poses in a mock clearing room in the scenario bay of the department's training facility. | Darren Hauck/ For POLITICO Magazine\n\nHer own rule, she says, is that her fellow officers can talk about other women’s “tits and ass” all they want as long as they don’t talk about her. It’s a sad compromise, she admits. “I'm sure they're talking about my tits and ass with somebody else, you know? They're just not doing it to my face. I guess, should I be grateful? ‘Oh, thank you?’ It's not easy, that's for sure.”\n\nGenerally speaking, female police officers report higher levels of harassment and perceived bias in promotion and assignments, along with an insidious sense of being undersupported by their superiors, according to past surveys. One survey of female agents at the federal level identified a lack of respect as the biggest barrier facing women in the field. Six in 10 said there are not enough female role models. Many also complained about the lack of family friendly policies, including shift work and mandatory relocations in certain agencies. But the culture will be the hardest and most important problem to fix.\n\nThat culture is part of the warrior model of policing, which took decades to entrench itself in American law enforcement agencies, according to a 2016 report by the advocacy group Women in Federal Law Enforcement, and “has created an ‘us vs. them’ mentality that bleeds into many aspects of the profession.”\n\nThe fastest way to change that culture is to hire different people. “There is nothing more important to the future of law enforcement than the successful recruitment, retention, and promotion of highly qualified women and underrepresented minorities,” the report concludes.\n\nJanette Sheil is the chief of the Program Oversight Division at the Probation and Pretrial Services Office, the federal law enforcement agency with more women on a percentage basis than any other. When she first arrived there in 1990, after leaving her job as a special agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, she knew she was going to a much more gender-balanced agency. But she did not know what a difference it would make.\n\n“As soon as I walked in the door, I knew I’d made the right choice. I was treated with respect from the first minute. Gender had no bearing on my job,” she says. Gender was irrelevant because women had reached a critical mass; their presence was normal, not bizarre. “I worked with a lot of very competent, well-educated women, and several were in management positions.”\n\nWhen that tipping point is reached, agencies can become more effective, positive places to be — not just for women but for men, says Cathy Lanier, the first female police chief of Washington, D.C., and, now, the first woman to head up security for the National Football League.\n\n“When I first started in the chief’s role, I was able to do a lot of things that my male counterparts couldn't do,” she says. At crime scenes, for example, Lanier could be seen walking past the police tape and putting her arm around the mother of a victim. If an officer was injured, she would hold his hand.\n\n“When I first started doing that, showing a little bit of compassion, people kind of looked a little shocked,” she remembers. “But I think I could pull it off a lot easier than a male chief. And after a while, it became more acceptable.” In this small way, she gave permission to officers — male and female — to be human, which could make their lives easier in all kinds of ways.\n\n“Just because you’ve got a uniform on doesn’t mean you have to be devoid of any emotion.”\n\nReena Flores and Derek Robertson contributed to this report.

Read in English.\n\nMiembros de un grupo secreto de Facebook para exagentes y agentes actuales de la Patrulla Fronteriza se burlaron de migrantes fallecidos, conversaron acerca de lanzarles burritos a las legisladoras latinas del Congreso que visitarían un centro de detención en Texas este lunes; y publicaron una vulgar imagen falsa que muestra a la Representante Alexandria Ocasio-Cortéz participando en sexo oral con un inmigrante detenido, según capturas de pantalla de estas publicaciones.\n\nManténte informado/a Suscríbete a nuestra newsletter en español y te avisaremos cada vez que publiquemos una historia en español.\n\nEn una de las conversaciones del grupo, sus miembros respondieron con indiferencia y burlas ante la publicación de un reportaje sobre un joven migrante guatemalteco, de 16 años, que murió en mayo pasado estando detenido en la estación de la Patrulla Fronteriza de Weslaco, Texas. Uno de los miembro subió un GIF del personaje Elmo con la cita: “Oh well” (Y, bueno, ¿qué?) Otro respondió con otra imagen con estas palabras “If he dies, he dies” (Si se muere, se muere).\n\nEl grupo de Facebook llamado “I’m 10-15” (Soy 10-15) fue creado en agosto de 2016 y tiene unos 9,500 por todo el país (“10-15” es el código que usa la Patrulla Fronteriza para denominar a “extranjeros detenidos”). En una introducción en línea, se describe al grupo como un foro de charlas “chistosas” y “serias” relacionadas con trabajar en la Patrulla. “Recuerda que nunca estás solo en esta familia”, señala dicha introducción.\n\nCaptura de pantalla del grupo de Facebook con estas palabras: “Eso es putas. El pueblo ha hablado y hoy ganó la democracia. Ya regresé. A todos quienes conocen mi verdadero yo, y me respaldaron, les agradezco. ¿A los demás? Esto es lo que tengo que decirles.....”\n\nComo entidad encargada de patrullar las fronteras norte y sur del país, la Patrulla Fronteriza ha sido fuente de escrutinios intensos recientemente, debido a las nuevas y agresivas medidas del gobierno de Trump, que tienen como objetivo detener el flujo de migrantes indocumentados que atraviesan la frontera entre México y los Estados Unidos. Dentro de la Agencia de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza de EE.UU. operan unos 20,000 agentes de la Patrulla. A su vez, la agencia del orden ha sido criticada por el supuesto maltrato de menores y adultos bajo su custodia. Inclusive sus líderes se han visto en crisis, como la renuncia de su director suplente, John Sander, hace una semana.\n\nProPublica recibió imágenes de varias de las conversaciones recientes del chat del grupo 10-15 de Facebook y pudo vincular a los participantes de estas conversaciones en línea con perfiles aparentemente legítimos de agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza, incluido el de un supervisor basado en El Paso Texas y el de un agente en Eagle Pass, Texas. ProPublica aún no ha logrado comunicarse con los miembros del grupo que subieron lo publicado.\n\nProPublica contactó a tres voceros de CBP en relación con el grupo de Facebook y les proporcionó nombres de tres agentes que parecen haber participado en las conversaciones en línea. La agencia aún no ha contestado.\n\n“Estos comentarios y memes son extremadamente preocupantes”, dijo Daniel Martínez, sociólogo de la Universidad de Arizona en Tucson dedicado a estudiar la frontera. “Son claramente xenofóbicos y sexistas”.\n\nSegún Martínez, las publicaciones reflejan lo que “aparenta ser una cultura generalizada de crueldad en la CBP dirigida hacia los inmigrantes. No se trata de unos cuantos agentes malandrines, o ‘descarrilados’”.\n\nCaptura de pantalla con el título del grupo de Facebook y su descripción: “Acerca de Donde la Patrulla Vieja se reúne con la Patrulla Nueva. Suban sus fotos y contenido relacionado con AMO. Cosas chistosas, serias y relacionadas con el trabajo. Antes que todo, somos familia. Aquí comienza la Línea Verde, con nosotros. Comienza una charla o discusión, o usa la página como tablero de mensajes o sesión de preguntas y respuestas. Estamos aquí para respaldarnos entre todos. Recuerda que en esta familia nunca estás solo.”\n\nEl grupo en Facebook de la Patrulla Fronteriza es uno de los ejemplos más recientes de la mala conducta que muestran ciertos funcionarios del orden público en espacios digitales, tanto públicos como privados. Una investigación de Reveal News descubrió cientos de oficiales del orden público en servicio activo y jubilados que se mueven en círculos extremistas en Facebook, los cuales incluyen grupos de supremacía de la raza blanca y de anti gobierno. Un grupo de investigadores que se nombran Plain View Project, emitió recientemente una extensa base de datos con publicaciones ofensivas hechas en Facebook por funcionarios del orden público actuales y anteriores.\n\nY, a principios de 2018, los investigadores federales que registraron el teléfono de Matthew Bowen, agente acusado de haber atropellado a un inmigrante guatemalteco con una camioneta Ford F150, encontraron una larga serie de mensajes de texto perturbadores y racistas, intercambiados por agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza del sur de Arizona. Los textos, posteriormente divulgados a través de documentos que fueron presentados en un juzgado federal de Tucson, describían a migrantes como “guats”, “wild ass shitbags” (salvajes, sacos de mierda), “beaners” (frijoleros), y “subhuman” (subhumanos). Los mensajes incluyeron varias charlas que mencionaban quemar a los migrantes.\n\nCaptura de pantalla de una de las publicaciones en el grupo de Facebook. Captura de pantalla de una de las publicaciones en el grupo de Facebook. El titular dice: “Escobar, Ocasio-Cortéz acompañarán otros miembros del Congreso en gira a las instalaciones de la Patrulla Fronteriza en Clint.” Una persona comenta: “Manden fotos.” Otra persona comenta: “Empecemos una recaudación en *go fund me* para el agente de CTX valiente que le aviente un burrito de 10-15 a una de estas perras. El que lo haga se gana el $$$ de la recaudación.”\n\nVarias de las publicaciones revisadas por ProPublica mencionan la visita planeada por el Caucus Hispano del Congreso a un polémico centro de detención en las afueras de El Paso, en la cual participarían las Representantes Ocasio-Cortéz y Verónica Escobar. Los agentes en las instalaciones de Clint, Texas han sido acusados de mantener a los menores detenidos allí, en condiciones de maltrato e inhumanas.\n\nLa gira no entusiasmó mucho a los miembros del grupo de la Patrulla Fronteriza en Facebook, donde se hizo notar que Ocasio-Cortéz, Demócrata de Queens, había comparado las instalaciones de la Patrulla Fronteriza con los campos de concentración nazi. Escobar es Demócrata y representante de El Paso.\n\nUno de los miembros animó a los demás lanzarles “burritos a esas perras”. Otro, aparentemente supervisor de la Patrulla, escribió: “Fuck the hoes” (Que se jodan esas malparidas). Un tercero puso: “There should be no photo ops for these scum buckets” (Estas escorias no deberían tener una oportunidad para fotografía).\n\nLas publicaciones quizás más perturbadoras se enfocan en Ocasio-Cortéz. Una incluye una ilustración fotográfica con su rostro participando en sexo oral en el entorno de un centro de detención. El texto que va con la imagen dice: “Lucky Illegal Immigrant Glory Hole Special Starring AOC” (Especial de agujero glorioso para ilegal suertudo con AOC como protagonista).\n\nOtro es una ilustración fotográfica de un Presidente Trump sonriente forzándole el rostro a Ocasio-Cortéz hacia la entrepierna. El agente que publicó la imagen comentó: “Eso es perras. El pueblo ha hablado y hoy ganó la democracia”.\n\nUna persona del equipo de Escobar dijo que lo publicado acerca de ella y de Ocasio-Cortez era “vil y sexista”. “Además, los comentarios de los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza dirigidos hacia inmigrantes, sobre todo los que han perdido la vida, son repugnantes y muestran una desconsideración total por la vida y la dignidad de los seres humanos”.\n\nCaptura de pantalla del grupo de Facebook. La publicación dice: “Bueno, voy a preguntar. ¿Han visto ustedes flotadores así de limpios? No quiero ser un imbécil, pero YO NUNCA HE VISTO FLOTADORES COMO ESTOS. ¿podría ser otra foto editada? Todos hemos visto que los demócratas y los partidos liberales hacen cosas bastante asquerosas.…”\n\nJoaquín Castro, director del Caucus Hispano del Congreso, se enfureció al revisar las conversaciones de Facebook del grupo. “Esto confirma las peores críticas acerca de la agencia de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza”, señaló el Representante Demócrata de San Antonio. “Se trata claramente de agentes tan desensibilizados que están llegando al punto de ser peligrosos tanto para los inmigrantes, como para sus compañeros de trabajo”. Castro añadió que los agentes que hicieron comentarios vulgares “no merecen llevar ningún uniforme que represente a los Estados Unidos de América”.\n\nVicki Gaubeca, directora de la Coalición de Comunidades de la Frontera Sur (Southern Border Communities Coalition), dijo que las publicaciones son evidencia adicional del sexismo y la misoginia que han plagado a la Patrulla Fronteriza durante mucho tiempo. “Por eso son los peores para reclutar mujeres”, agregó Gaubeca, cuyo grupo trabaja para reformar la agencia. “Tienen el [porcentaje más bajo de agentes o funcionarias mujeres]{.underline} de cualquier agencia federal del orden público”.\n\nEn otro hilo, un miembro del grupo publicó la foto del padre que murió ahogado junto con su hija de casi dos años en el Río Bravo, cuando ambos trataron de cruzar el río para entrar a los Estados Unidos. La imagen ha circulado en un sinfín de medios en línea durante estos últimos días y generado protestas.\n\nEl miembro del grupo de Facebook de la Patrulla que público la imagen, se preguntó si la foto podría haber sido falsificada debido a que los cuerpos se veían tan “limpios”. (La fotografía fue tomada por un fotógrafo de Associated Press y no hay indicios de que haya sido posada o manipulada). “NUNCA HE VISTO FLOTADORES COMO ESTOS”, comentó la persona y añadió, “¿podría ser otra foto editada? Todos hemos visto que los demócratas y los partidos liberales hacen cosas bastante asquerosas…”\n\nTraducción de Mati Vargas-Gibson.",

Sign up for ProPublica’s Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published.\n\nWe recently uncovered racist, sexist and hateful posts and comments in a secret Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents.\n\nSuch secret Facebook groups are only visible to their members. This means the general public cannot flag inflammatory posts and exchanges, such a photo illustration depicting President Donald Trump sexually assaulting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and posts making fun of migrants who died while crossing the Rio Grande.\n\nSince we published our story, more people have gotten in touch to tell us about other secret groups that may warrant closer scrutiny.\n\nWe know there are members of groups who don’t agree with everything that is said in these forums. We also recognize that these groups can be a helpful support network for often-complicated issues that come up on the job. So we need your guidance to do more reporting. We’d like to hear about what’s happening in your communities, particularly from those of you who are concerned public servants.\n\nHere’s how you can help:\n\nAre you in a group whose members are posting content that causes you concern? Tell us what you’ve seen. Have you reported something to Facebook that the company left up? We’d like to see that, too.\n\nAre you eligible to join groups in your community that might have concerning posts from public officials? You can join and report back on anything of concern you think we should see. For example: Are you a Border Patrol or ICE agent? A police officer? A corrections officer? A TSA agent? A service member? Let us know if there are groups you think journalists should examine.\n\nWe don’t want you to do anything that would jeopardize your safety or endanger your career. If you have concerns, please feel free to get in touch with us directly on Signal, an encrypted app for messages and calls; send a message to 347-244-2134. If you’d like to contact a reporter, email borderpatrol@propublica.org. We’re also happy to help you figure out what to screenshot.\n\nThe best way to help us is by filling out the following questionnaire. It will ask you for:\n\nA picture or screenshot of the group’s “about” page, including its background photo, number of members and starting date.\n\nInformation about the group’s administrators (the people who created or moderate the activity), in case we need to contact them.\n\nAny information you have about who belongs to the group.\n\nScreenshots of posts you think we should see.\n\nInstructions for viewing a specific post on Facebook.\n\nTo take a screenshot of a whole post along with all of its comments, you can click on the date or time of the post to open it in a new browser window. If you’re on your phone, you’ll need to take multiple screenshots of the post as you scroll down. If you’re on a desktop or laptop computer, you can use a browser extension, like Full Page Screen Capture, to take a screenshot of the whole post.\n\nIf you need help capturing images, please get in touch with us.",

Read parts two and three.\n\nHundreds of active-duty and retired law enforcement officers from across the United States are members of Confederate, anti-Islam, misogynistic or anti-government militia groups on Facebook, a Reveal investigation has found.\n\nThese cops have worked at every level of American law enforcement, from tiny, rural sheriff’s departments to the largest agencies in the country, such as the Los Angeles and New York police departments. They work in jails and schools and airports, on boats and trains and in patrol cars. And, Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting discovered, they also read and contribute to groups such as “White Lives Matter” and “DEATH TO ISLAM UNDERCOVER.”\n\nThe groups cover a range of extremist ideologies. Some present themselves publicly as being dedicated to benign historical discussion of the Confederacy, but are replete with racism inside. Some trade in anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant memes. Some are openly Islamophobic. And almost 150 of the officers we found are involved with violent anti-government groups such as the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters.\n\nMore than 50 departments launched internal investigations after being presented with our findings, in some cases saying they would examine officers’ past conduct to see if their online activity mirrored their policing in real life. And some departments have taken action, with at least one officer being fired for violating department policies.\n\nWe’ve been telling stories that change laws and lives for more than 40 years. And we’re just getting started. Sign up for our newsletter.\n\nU.S. law enforcement agencies, many of which have deeply troubled histories of discrimination, have long been accused of connections between officers and extremist groups. At the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, marchers flew a “Blue Lives Matter” flag alongside anti-Semitic and white supremacist messages. In Portland, Oregon, police officers were found to have been texting with a far-right group that regularly hosts white supremacists and white nationalists at its rallies. A classified FBI Counterterrorism Policy Guide from April 2015, obtained by The Intercept, warned that white supremacists and other far-right groups had infiltrated American law enforcement.\n\nIt can be difficult to determine how deep or widespread these connections run. Researchers recently found numerous examples of police officers posting violent and racist content on their public Facebook pages. Reveal’s investigation shows for the first time that officers in agencies across the country have actively joined private hate groups, participating in the spread of extremism on Facebook.\n\nMost of the hateful Facebook groups these cops frequent are closed, meaning only members are allowed to see content posted by other members. Reveal joined dozens of these groups and verified the identities of almost 400 current and retired law enforcement officials who are members.\n\nOne guard at the Angola prison in Louisiana, Geoffery Crosby, was a member of 56 extremist groups, including 45 Confederate groups and one called “BAN THE NAACP.”\n\nA detective at the Harris County Sheriff’s Office in Houston, James “J.T.” Thomas, was a member of the closed Facebook group “The White Privilege Club.”\n\nThe group contains hundreds of hateful, racist and anti-Semitic posts; links to interviews with white supremacists such as Richard Spencer; and invites to events such as the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. Users regularly post memes featuring Pepe the Frog, the alt-right mascot, with captions such as, “white people, do something.” And there are explicitly racist jokes, such as one with a photo of fried chicken and grape soda with the caption, “Mom packed me a niggable for school.”\n\nThomas once posted the logo for the Black College Football Hall of Fame inside the group with a simple caption: “Seriously. Why?” Soon after, he posted a meme about an elderly African American woman confusedly responding to a reporter’s question by naming a fried chicken restaurant.\n\nAfter being presented with Thomas’ postings on Facebook, the Harris County Sheriff’s Office fired him in February for violating a number of employee conduct policies.\n\n“These policies state that ‘an employee’s actions must never bring the HCSO into disrepute, nor should conduct be detrimental to the HCSO’s efficient operation. … Personnel who, through their use of social media, cause undue embarrassment or damage the reputation of, or erode the public’s confidence in, the HCSO shall be deemed to have violated this policy and shall be subject to counseling and/or discipline,” the department said in an email.\n\nIn a hearing to appeal his firing, Thomas said he didn’t realize he was a member of the closed group and defended his behavior. “If you remove the black female out of the picture, what’s racist about it?” he said. The Harris County Sheriff’s Civil Service Commission upheld his firing.\n\nLonnie Allen Brown of the Kingsville Police Department in Texas, a member of three Islamophobic groups, posted a photo of a young black man with a pistol to his head with the header, “If Black lives really mattered …. They’d stop shooting each other!” He also posted an image that read: “Islam. A cult of oppression, rape, pedophilia and murder cannot be reasoned with!” Neither he nor his department returned calls for comment.\n\nPeter Simi, an associate professor of sociology at Chapman University who has studied extremist groups for more than 20 years, said biased views like those expressed in these Facebook groups inevitably influence an individual’s decision-making process.\n\n“The perceptions we have about the world at large drive the decisions we make,” Simi said. “To think that people could completely separate these extremist right-wing views from their actions just isn’t consistent with what we know about the decision-making process.”\n\nWhile Facebook vows that it prioritizes meaningful content, its algorithms also appear to play a role in strengthening biases. The more extreme groups we joined, the more Facebook suggested new – and often even more troubling – groups to join or pages to like. It was easy to see how users, including police officers, could be increasingly radicalized by what they saw on their news feed.\n\nWhat’s harder to see is how these views affected their policing offline.\n\n‘I may have used the N-word’\n\nDisciplinary records and investigations into police misconduct are kept secret in a majority of states, meaning most American cops enjoy a blanket of protection that can cover up biases. But in some cases, we found public documents that showed the officers we identified via Facebook also had been involved in real-life instances of alleged racism or other misconduct.\n\nWill Weisenberger, a sheriff’s deputy in Madison County, Mississippi, was a member of a closed Facebook group called “White Lives Matter.” He’s also been caught up in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the department for allegedly engaging in decades of systemic racism and discriminatory policing.\n\nRacism was so systematic at the Madison County Sheriff’s Department, the ACLU asserts, that the department’s blank arrest forms came with two words already filled in: “Black” and “Male.”\n\nLawyers for the ACLU deposed Weisenberger and asked him about an incident in which a fellow deputy alleged that Weisenberger had punched an African American man in the face while the man’s hands were cuffed. Then they asked him if he ever uses any racial slurs while on duty.\n\n“I may have used the N-word,” Weisenberger said, according to the deposition.\n\n“It’s not something I’m proud of or do every day,” he continued.\n\nNeither the Sheriff’s Department nor Weisenberger responded to calls for comment. The Sheriff’s Department wouldn’t release Weisenberger’s disciplinary record or a copy of the complaint made by his colleague. Police disciplinary records in Mississippi are confidential.\n\nTO PROTECT AND TO SLUR\n\nThe American militia movement, a breeding ground for hate, is pulling in cops on Facebook\n\nAmerican cops have openly engaged in Islamophobia on Facebook, with no penalties\n\nThese police officers were members of extremist groups on Facebook\n\nIn Chicago, Lt. Richard Moravec was a member of a closed Facebook group called “Any islamist insults infidels, I will put him under my feet,” which disappeared from Facebook before we could join it or search it for posts by officers.\n\nWhile we don’t know if he ever interacted with the Islamophobic group, Moravec has posted content that appears to be openly anti-transgender and anti-Islam on his personal Facebook page.\n\nOne meme Moravec posted featured a photo of a young girl with the caption, “Please! Don’t confuse me. I’m a girl. Don’t teach me to question if I’m a boy, transexual, transgendered, intersexed or two spirited.”\n\nAnd Chicago’s open records on police conduct revealed that he also has been the subject of 70 allegations, including accusations of illegal use of force, verbal abuse and criminal misconduct, according to the Citizens Police Data Project. That’s more than 99 percent of Chicago police officers. One of the allegations resulted in a five-day suspension.\n\nMoravec didn’t respond to a call for comment.\n\n‘This group is sometimes racist does this bother you?’\n\nTo find cops with connections to extremist groups, we built lists of two different types of Facebook users: members of extremist groups and members of police groups.\n\nWe wrote software to download these lists directly from Facebook, something the platform allowed at the time. In mid-2018, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and after we already had downloaded our data, Facebook shut down the ability to download membership lists from groups. Then we ran those two datasets against each other to find users who were members of at least one law enforcement group and one far-right group.\n\nWe got 14,000 hits.\n\nWe did not assume that everyone in a police Facebook group was an actual officer, because many could be relatives of police officers or just really into law enforcement. So, we spent months poring over individual Facebook pages, looking for clues, such as photos of the officer in uniform, or posts about police events, or notes mourning lost cops. Then we corroborated what we found on Facebook with additional research, often calling the departments to confirm the individual either still or had once worked there.\n\nUltimately, we confirmed that almost 400 users were indeed either currently employed as police officers, sheriffs or prison guards or had once worked in law enforcement.\n\nWe then asked to join the closed extremist groups. Many groups ask users questions in order to join, and these often offer insight into the nature of the group. The group “Stop Radical Islam in America,” for example, asks, “Why do you personally think Islam should be banned in America?” At least 12 current and former police officers were members of that group.\n\nThe group “Confederate Brothers & Sisters,” which counts at least 25 current and former cops as members, explicitly asks, “This group is sometimes racist does this bother you?” Inside that group, we found several cops and ex-cops posting racist comments.\n\nWe used our real names and photos and answered the questions honestly to join these groups. We used general language, often saying we were “interested in learning more.” As a result, many of the most extreme groups rejected our application to join, ignored us or blocked us from viewing the group.\n\nBut dozens let us in.\n\nWe didn’t seek to find every single hate group or police group on Facebook, and we couldn’t confirm the professions of hundreds of the users in our database.\n\nSeveral officers claimed that they didn’t even know they were members of the closed groups we identified them in. And that’s probably the case for at least some of these officers, due to Facebook’s policies for joining groups.\n\nUntil late 2018, Facebook allowed users to invite friends to join groups they thought would interest them. The invitees would receive a notification telling them they were a member of a new group, and depending on each user’s algorithm, the user’s news feed might include content and postings from the group. But it’s certainly possible that cops could have been added to groups without realizing it, especially if they’re not active on Facebook.\n\nFacebook has since changed its policies. Users now get a request to join a group that they have to confirm.\n\nBut that doesn’t apply to dozens of current and retired officers who have commented on and liked posts in closed extremist groups or who proactively joined groups themselves, without being invited by somebody else.\n\nWe examined a tiny sample of what exists on Facebook — what Megan Squire, a computer science professor from Elon University in North Carolina, called “a tiny, postage-stamp-sized window into Facebook’s skyscraper of data.”\n\nSquire, who has studied hate groups on Facebook for years and maintains her own database, said the social media platform, and especially closed groups, are used by hate groups such as white supremacists to plan events and build camaraderie.\n\n“Charlottesville was planned on Facebook,” Squire said. “Extremists are definitely using Facebook groups to plan physical, real-world events or just to make their lives a little smaller, to find friends.”\n\nA spokeswoman for Facebook said the company doesn’t tolerate hate speech on the platform and works extremely hard to identify and shut down hate groups. In the last year, as part of a push to reform the company, Facebook has said it won’t tolerate white nationalist or white supremacist content, and it has moved to shut down the accounts of some of the most popular hate-speech provocateurs.\n\nBut while groups with overt neo-Nazi, white supremacist or Ku Klux Klan names get shut down relatively quickly by Facebook, hate groups have wised up in response.\n\n‘I like memes, they make me laugh’\n\nAs has happened elsewhere on the internet, extremist groups on Facebook often use in-jokes and subtle references in their names to avoid takedown policies. Moderators of closed groups control who can join, and on Facebook, cops can hide who they really are — using false names and listing pretend jobs.\n\nInside the closed Facebook groups to which we gained access, transparently racist, misogynistic and homophobic content is on full display. We catalogued more than 120 active and retired officers posting in these groups or commenting in support of others.\n\nIn one 48-hour period, civilian members of one closed group posted a steady stream of hateful content:\n\nAt least six law enforcement officers were members of the group, which was called “Anti-SJW Pinochet’s Helicopter Pilot Academy.” The name showcases the wordplay central to the white supremacists’ rebranding as the “alt-right.” It refers to the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who had his political opponents thrown out of helicopters into the Pacific Ocean. “SJW” stands for “social justice warrior,” a term used to mock individuals who support equal rights for people of color, women and the LGBTQ community.\n\nWhile the terminology is new and sometimes cryptic, the core messages of the alt-right echo longstanding neo-Nazi and white supremacist premises. Perry Tolliver, a retired corrections officer from Baltimore, and Michael Pinegar, a former Arizona Department of Corrections officer — who were both members of the Pinochet group until it disappeared from Facebook earlier this month — seemed well-versed in the alt-right’s terminology. In separate posts in the group, both Tolliver and Pinegar referred to African Americans as “dindus” — a racist slur common on Facebook and elsewhere.\n\nIn a similar vein, Detective Steve Fumuso from Westchester County in New York frequently inserted comments into posts in the Pinochet group that denigrated African Americans, Latinos and the LGBTQ community.\n\nFumuso posted a meme with a white man making the “OK” symbol — a favored gesture of the alt-right — and the words “fuckin mint” under a racist joke about Mexicans in December 2017. Earlier, he had commented, “Ha ha ha haaaa. Fuck em,” under a “Tucker Carlson Tonight” clip about Mexicans being worried about crime committed by Central American migrants.\n\nWestchester County Public Safety Commissioner Thomas Gleason said the department’s Special Investigations Unit would launch an investigation.\n\nIn an interview months later, Fumuso said he had retired shortly after the internal affairs investigation. He said the two things had nothing to do with each other.\n\n“I like memes, they make me laugh. I didn’t join to express any racist views,” he said. “I don’t care what you think. That’s my opinion. You know what’s a racist comment? ‘Brits are all full of shit.’ ”\n\n(The reporter conducting the interview, Will Carless, has a British accent.)\n\nSeveral officers contacted for this story countered that they have a First Amendment right to opine on social media, even if those opinions are unpopular or offensive to some people.\n\nHowever, while civilians enjoy First Amendment protection from government censorship or harassment, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that public agencies such as police departments may penalize their employees for speech and behavior in certain cases.\n\nValerie Van Brocklin, a former federal prosecutor who trains police departments and other public employees on social media use, said police officers across the country have been fired or suspended for making off-color jokes or leaving problematic comments under newspaper articles.\n\n“I ask them, ‘Would you, as a cop, in your uniform, put that on a sandwich board and walk up and down the streets of your town? ’ ” Van Brocklin said. “And they’ll say, ‘No, because I could be fired for that.’ Well, instead of putting it on a sandwich board, you put it up for the whole world to see, so why would you think it’s protected?”\n\n‘We don’t discuss personnel matters’\n\nNo single code of conduct or ethics policy governs the thousands of jurisdictions in the U.S. that employ police officers. Different law enforcement agencies have widely differing standards for the behavior they accept from their personnel, and this was reflected in the responses we received from departments.\n\nIn Watkins Glen, New York, Sgt. in Charge Steven Decker refused to talk about the fact that one of his officers, Robert Brill, was a member of two groups connected to the Proud Boys, a violent alt-right gang, and the group “Kekistani Freestate,” named for Kek, a sort of deity employed by the alt-right for memes and other jokes.\n\n“We don’t discuss personnel matters,” Decker said, before hanging up. Brill didn’t respond to calls for comment.\n\nThe Abbeville Police Department in Georgia hasn’t responded to multiple phone calls and emails about one of its officers, Joel Quinn, frequently featuring conspiracy theories and anti-Islam posts on his personal Facebook wall. He also has posted inside a Confederate group.\n\nReached via Facebook Messenger, Quinn defended his posts. “Its also my responsibility to detect possible threats to my community all the way up to and including my country,” he wrote. “Think about this, majority of crimes are committed by minorities (black, hispanic, etc) per FBI statistics yet I don’t ‘prey’ on any particular one.” (According to the latest FBI Uniform Crime Reporting statistics, 68.9 percent of arrestees in 2017 were white.)\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Corrections hasn’t commented on corrections officer Sheldon Best, a member of “Crusades Against Degeneracy,” a group that trades in racist, anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant and homophobic content. In 2017, Best commented on an NPR story reporting that babies of color are now the majority in the United States. Below it, he wrote: “Maybe, but minority on minority homocide (sic) will make sure adults of color remain a minority.”\n\nBest said in an interview that he was apologetic about this and other posts in the group. “Some people” could view his membership in the group as problematic, he acknowledged. However, he said that while some members of the group hold discriminatory views, he does not.\n\nWe provided the New York Police Department with posts from Officer Randy Paulsaint, a member of 13 groups committed to the anti-feminist Men Going Their Own Way movement.\n\nThe groups contain memes depicting women as evil, greedy and jealous. In one, someone posted a meme about a woman asking for a Christmas present. In the comments, Paulsaint inserted a gif of a man kicking a woman in the head.\n\nThe NYPD said its investigation was closed as unsubstantiated. “The investigation was unable to clearly prove or disprove that the subject officer made the offending posts,” the department said.\n\nPeter Simi, the sociologist, said white supremacists and other extremists have been working hard to integrate their hateful views into society in as many ways as possible.\n\n“Leaders have long been advocating for infiltration of society — graduate from high school, go to college, join the military, become a police officer, become a school teacher — get inside the system,” he said. “That’s why it’s so difficult to get a handle on the scope of this, because the purpose for those who are infiltrating these systems is to be careful not to tip their hands. So we’re always dealing with the tip of the iceberg.”\n\nResearchers Daneel Knoetze and Michael Dailey contributed to this story.

        "text": "A surge of migrants arriving at the Texas-Mexico border has pushed the country's immigration system to the breaking point as new policies aimed at both undocumented immigrants and legal asylum seekers have contributed to a humanitarian crisis. The Texas Tribune is maintaining its in-depth reporting on this national issue. More in this series\n\n*Editor's note: This story was updated Tuesday to include information from a former U.S. Customs and Border Protection advisor about why the agency isn't accepting donations.\n\nOn Sunday, Austin Savage and five of his friends huddled into an SUV and went to an El Paso Target, loading up on diapers, wipes, soaps and toys.\n\nAbout $340 later, the group headed to a Border Patrol facility holding migrant children in nearby Clint with the goal of donating their goods. Savage said he and his friends had read an article from The New York Times detailing chaos, sickness and filth in the overcrowded facility, and they wanted to help.\n\nThe Tribune's reporting for this project is supported by the Pulitzer Center.\n\nBut when they arrived, they found that the lobby was closed. The few Border Patrol agents — Savage said there were between eight and 10 of them — moving in and out of a parking facility ignored them.\n\nFor a while, the group stood there dumbfounded about what to do next. Ultimately, they decided to pack up and head home. Savage said he wasn’t completely surprised by the rejection; before he left, the group spotted a discarded plastic bag near the lobby door holding toothpaste and soap that had a note attached to it: “I heard y’all need soap + toothpaste for kids.”\n\nCourtesy of Armando Martinez Photography\n\n“A good friend of mine is an immigration attorney, and he warned us that we were going to get rejected,” Savage said. “We were aware of that, but it’s just the idea of doing something as opposed to passively allowing this to occur.”\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nBorder Patrol facilities are only supposed to hold detained migrants for a short period of time, until they are processed. But an influx of migrants along the southwest border has stretched facilities in places like Clint and McAllen beyond capacity, leading to what people who have visited them have called unsafe and unsanitary conditions.\n\nA slew of other sympathetic people, advocacy groups and lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle have expressed a desire to lend a hand to the kids housed in the facilities. But after purchasing items like toys, soap, toothbrushes, diapers and medicine — especially as news reports circulate of facilities having drinking water that tastes like bleach and sick children without enough clothing — they’ve been met with a common message: No donations are being accepted.\n\n“It makes me feel powerless knowing there’s children taking care of toddlers and little kids,” said Gabriel Acuña, who grew up in Clint and attempted to visit the facility in his hometown Sunday morning. “Knowing what’s happening in your community and that you can’t give these kids supplies to clean or clothe themselves — it’s heartbreaking.\n\n“For God’s sake, they’re kids, man.”\n\nThe substandard living conditions have been described in great detail over the past few weeks. Last week, an attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice argued in court that the government shouldn’t be required to give migrant children inside Border Patrol detention facilities toothbrushes, soap, towels or showers.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nMost have assigned blame for the substandard living conditions to federal officials who are unsure of how to handle the influx of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. The surge has also overwhelmed facilities and led to serious health and safety risks for those sheltered in them. Some kids and teens have spent nearly a month without adequate food or water. Nearly a dozen others in a McAllen facility were sick with the flu.\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Terry Canales of Edinburg tweeted this weekend that he wrote to Border Patrol asking for a list of acceptable items to donate. He said officials told his office by email they do not accept donations.\n\n“The whole situation is disgusting, but I’m always hopeful that the better part of us as human beings will shine through,” said Canales, whose district neighbors the McAllen facility. “Those children feel like the world has given up on them, and we have to fight for them.”\n\nAn official with Border Patrol did not respond to a request for comment, but Theresa Brown, a former policy advisor for U.S. Customs and Border Protections, said there’s a legal reason why Border Patrol and other government agencies aren’t accepting donations from do-gooders.\n\nUnder the Antideficiency Act, the government can’t spend any money or accept any donations other than what Congress has allocated to it. The theory behind not accepting donations, Brown said, is so that the government isn’t beholden to private-sector entities for what should be appropriated government actions.\n\n“It’s partially a constitutional thing about Congress controlling the purse and only being able to spend money that Congress gives, but it’s also about ethics,” she said. “Without a change in law, DHS, CPB and Border Patrol cannot accept those private donations.”\n\nBut despite getting their donation requests denied, some sympathetic Texans are remaining persistent.\n\nCanales said he had a conference call Monday morning with Rodolfo Karisch, U.S. Border Patrol's Rio Grande Valley sector chief, and had a “short but productive conversation” about the living conditions for kids being held in processing facilities.\n\n“These kids are being underserved, and they’re not getting what they need,” Canales said. “We discussed diapers, hygiene products, and I pressed upon him that from a PR perspective that it looks terrible we’re not meeting their needs and they’re not accepting donations from the public.\n\n“He, to some extent, agreed with me and said he would get back with me and see how we can collaborate,” he said. “So the lines of communication are open.”\n\nAcuña, who attempted to donate bars of soap, toothbrushes and toothpaste from a local Dollar Tree this weekend, said a lot of people have reached out to him after he publicized his encounter at the Clint facility. He said he is working to get in contact with town leadership to come up with a plan of action moving forward.\n\n“If the government isn’t going to do anything, then let the community help and do something for these kids,” Acuña said.\n\nSavage, meanwhile, plans to visit the same Clint facility Monday with the same diapers, wipes, soaps and toys. He’s going with low expectations — especially since a number of kids have been moved from the facility after reports of poor living conditions.\n\n“We imagine they will reject it,” he said.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nIf they do, he plans to turn to local organizations, such as the Annunciation House, that are housing families that Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained and separated on the El Paso-Juarez border.

        "text": "Washington (CNN) Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Friday that it appears there will be a 25% decrease in June in numbers of migrants crossing at the US-Mexico border .\n\nMore than 144,000 migrants had been encountered or arrested at the US-Mexico border in May , the highest monthly total in 13 years.\n\nMcAleenan credited Trump administration initiatives, especially the increase in interdictions by Mexico over the past three weeks and the return of some asylum seekers to Mexico for the duration of their immigration proceeds, a program McAleenan says is being expanded.\n\nThat program, however, is being fought in court, including by a union representing asylum officers which opposes the initiative.\n\nA dip in border crossings is common during the hot summer months, though McAleenan downplayed the role of seasonal trends in migration, saying that he expects to be able to tell by late July if these initiatives will have a sustained impact.\n\nOver recent months, there's been a dramatic spike in apprehensions at the southern border, particularly of families and unaccompanied minors -- overwhelming the administration and prompting a request for emergency funding to the border.\n\nOn Thursday, the House passed a $4.6 billion Senate bill to send emergency funding to the border, a vote that triggered outrage from progressives who objected to the legislation and an outpouring of emotion on the House floor. The measure, which passed 305-102, will next go to the White House for President Donald Trump's signature.\n\nMcAleenan lauded the Hill's bipartisan passage of the funding bill which he said he hopes the President will sign next week.\n\nThe measure comes against the backdrop of media reports of perilous conditions at border facilities . A team of doctors, lawyers and advocates warned of what they said were major health and hygiene problems at several US Customs and Border Protection facilities in Texas, including a station in Clint.\n\nMcAleenan reiterated Friday that he has warned of overcrowding in border facilities for months, but also pushed back strongly on what he termed \"unsubstantiated\" reports about the Clint, Texas, facility where he says children are receiving supplies such as blankets and toothbrushes, despite claims to the contrary.\n\nThe lawyers have since asked a federal judge to hold the Trump administration in contempt and to order immediate improvements to conditions at Customs and Border Protection facilities where children are being held.\n\nSpotlighting the risks and tragedy on the border, McAleenan said the young girl who drowned beside her father trying to cross the Rio Grande River into the US was the fourth child to die attempting to cross in the past week.\n\nThe \"situation should not be acceptable to any of us,\" he said.\n\nA lull for nonprofit shelters too\n\nIn the Rio Grande Valley sector of Texas, the busiest region for migrant arrests on the southern border, those running nearby nonprofit shelters have seen a lull over the past week, but weren't sure it would last.\n\nThe Salvation Army of McAllen/Hidalgo County serves as an overflow facility to house and feed migrants when the primary nonprofit shelters in the region are full.\n\n\"Last week we had an overflow,\" said Maggie Pena, business operations manager. \"But the numbers have decreased this week.\"\n\nShe said what the migrants need the most when they arrive, is a hot meal and shower, and \"somebody to understand,\" added Alvin J. Migues, regional emergency disaster services director.\n\nOn Tuesday, 11 migrants were brought to Good Neighbor Settlement House, which serves as the primary overnight shelter in Brownsville, Texas, for migrants who are released from government custody before they travel to their destinations throughout the US, said Marianela Ramirez-Watson, the Refugee Respite Program.\n\nThat's much fewer than the 60 to 90 people a day the small facility has been receiving.\n\nOn Wednesday, when CNN visited the shelter, a couple and their 3-year-old daughter Ariceli were inside, a few hours before they were destined to travel to South Carolina.\n\n\"We are hoping to give her a better life,\" her father said in Spanish. \"And get good medical treatment.\"\n\nAriceli's parents, who had fled El Salvador in fear of a gang initiation a few years ago, were living and working in Mexico, but crossed the Rio Grande earlier this week seeking better medical care for their daughter. The toddler, who couldn't hold herself up, had microcephaly, stemming from a Zika infection her mother had during pregnancy.\n\nThe \"happy ending\" isn't at the shelter, but \"when they leave us and go with family,\" said Ramirez-Watson.\n\nThis story has been updated.",

        "text": "McAllen, Texas (CNN) Detained migrants generally are not supposed to spend more than 72 hours at the Centralized Processing Center in McAllen, Texas, per US Customs and Border Protection policy .\n\nBut CBP said the average time single adults spend at the processing center is more than 100 hours, the latest sign of how the facility's limits are being tested.\n\nWhen CNN returned to the center on Thursday, we found that little has changed since our last visit.\n\nBut the level of assistance has grown -- personnel from the Coast Guard, Federal Protective Service, US Marshals, National Guard and other Department of Homeland Security were all involved in the processing of migrants.\n\nOfficial: When funding dries up, 'this is the result'\n\nNo signs on the large warehouse facility denote what it is, apart from small US government logos on some perimeter fencing.\n\nThe media tour began in the same place where buses drop off migrants at the sally port of the converted warehouse.\n\nThey are offered snacks and drinks before they are processed and screened for medical care. Here, they can also change their clothes. Portable toilets, showers and laundry facilities are also available.\n\nInside the cavernous space, the center is divided into sections for single adults, families and unaccompanied minors, all behind chain-link fencing.\n\nThe lights are never turned off and Customs and Border Protection says the fences allow staff to see what is happening at all times.\n\nThe single adults section is in a separate part of the building with no beds or mats on the concrete floor, just a few benches. The migrants also receive mylar blankets, which CBP said is for sanitary reasons.\n\nThere were 344 single adults at the facility. On average, this population is spending 100 hours there, according to CBP.\n\nWhy do single adults remain at the facility for so long? \"When [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] does not receive funding -- this is the result,\" Carmen Qualia, US Border Patrol acting executive officer for law enforcement operational programs, told the group of visiting reporters.\n\nQualia blamed the back up of migrants inside the facility on the inability to transfer migrants into ICE custody, inferring more funding was need to to that.\n\nGenerally, single adults and families who are arrested by Border Patrol, are processed, then transferred to ICE custody for deportation or release. However, earlier this year Border Patrol began directly releasing migrant families with a notice to appear in court. This has eased some of the wait times for families in in the facility, Qualia said.\n\nMore than 40,000 family members have been released in the Rio Grande Valley since March, when the releases began, to a bus stations or the nearby Catholic Charities shelter, she added.\n\nUnaccompanied children are taken into custody by a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nShe added that daily apprehensions in the Rio Grade Valley sector average 1,500 migrants.\n\n\"We way surpassed what we thought we would have in apprehensions,\" she said.\n\nA play area beyond the chain-link fence\n\nWhen CNN toured the center, there were around 1,900 people total, in a space designed for 1,500, which included more than 400 unaccompanied children and around 1,200 family members. However, these numbers fluctuate daily. Unlike in the area for single adults, green gym mats are on the floor for families and children to rest on.\n\nOn the side of the facility beyond the chain-link cells, six young children played in an area resembling a mini-daycare with a play mat, toys and a stroller. CBP said the average stay for families at this time is 48-72 hours, and under 70 hours for unaccompanied children.\n\nLast week, the facility had \"hundreds\" of unaccompanied children who were not able to be moved into HHS custody, Qualia said.\n\nChildren have stayed in this facility beyond the 72 hour mark, she said.\n\nHighlighting the strain on resources, Qualia said that CBP is spending $1.2 million on food per month for the entire Rio Grande Valley region -- spending more overall this year than \"ever anticipated.\"",

        "text": "The steep increase comes most sharply among Democrats, though there are increases across party lines. Back in January, just 23% of Democrats called it a crisis as President Donald Trump took that line in an effort to build support for border wall funding during the longest-ever government shutdown. Now, 70% of Democrats see the situation at the border as a crisis.\n\nAmong independents, the share who see a crisis at the border has climbed from 47% to 72%, and among Republicans, it's up 11 points to 82%.\n\nThe same poll finds little movement in Trump's approval rating over that time for handling immigration (42% approve now, 41% did in January). Trump's overall approval numbers hold steady in the new poll at 43% approving and 52% disapproving.\n\nThere is disagreement across party lines about the cause of the crisis at the border. A majority of Democrats consider it a crisis because of the treatment migrants are receiving as they attempt to cross the border (54%), while most Republicans say they think it's a crisis because of the number of migrants attempting to enter the country (63%). Among independents, slightly more say it's a crisis due to the number of migrants attempting to cross (35%) than because of the treatment migrants are receiving (28%).\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans (62%) say they disapprove of the treatment migrants are receiving at the border, but there's a steep partisan divide here as well. Democrats are near-unanimous in their disapproval (93% disapprove), and a majority of independents feel the same (60%), but most Republicans (62%) say they approve of the way migrants are being treated by the government after crossing the US-Mexico border.\n\nThere is a similarly large partisan divide over whether refugees from Central American countries should be able to seek asylum in the US. While a majority of Americans (60%) say yes, that stands at 85% among Democrats, 60% among independents and just 31% among Republicans.\n\nBut majorities across party lines say that the government's top priority in dealing with immigrants living in the US illegally ought to be developing a plan to allow some people doing so to become legal residents (80% overall say so, including 96% of Democrats, 81% of independents and 63% of Republicans).\n\nJust 15% overall -- and only 32% of Republicans -- say the nation should prioritize deporting all people living in the US illegally over developing such a plan.\n\nThe survey also finds little movement in approval ratings for the President's handling of foreign affairs generally (40% approve, 54% disapprove, neither changed significantly since April).\n\nBut there have been increases in disapproval for the President's handling of North Korea (49% disapprove, up from 45% in May and the highest disapproval in more than a year) and Iran (51% disapprove, up from 43% in May). The poll was in the field when the President became the first American president to set foot in North Korea, and found no difference in approval ratings on this issue measured after that event.\n\nDemocratic disapproval of the President's handling of both North Korea and Iran has grown in the last month (from 77% to 85% disapproval on North Korea, and from 71% to 89% on Iran), while Republican approval has also ticked up from 66% to 75% on his handling of Iran and from 73% to 78% on North Korea.\n\nAmericans continue to say things in the US generally are going well (57% say so, about the same as last November), with 42% saying things are going badly.\n\nTrump's steadily negative approval ratings come alongside steadily negative favorability ratings.\n\nOverall, 41% have a favorable view of the President and 56% an unfavorable one. That is a bit more negative than in May or April, but about the same as his standing in March.\n\nAmong registered voters, the 12-point deficit Trump faces in favorability ratings is larger than those faced by any of the Democrats attempting to unseat him in 2020 who were tested in this poll. The worst-rated Democrat in the poll -- Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to results from the same poll released on Monday -- holds a net-negative rating among registered voters by 6 points.\n\nThe CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS Friday through Sunday among a random national sample of 1,613 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.0 percentage points. It is larger for subgroups.",

        "text": "(CNN) It's an alarm immigrant rights groups have been sounding since the day President Trump took office.\n\nTrump himself suggested well before his January 2017 inauguration that he planned to deport millions of people, telling \"60 Minutes\" days after his election that millions of criminals would be kicked out of the US once he was at the helm.\n\nBut while the number of deportations have increased since he took office, the mass deportations he warned of haven't materialized.\n\nTrump's tweets Monday, threatening that \"millions\" of undocumented immigrants would be deported next week , revived fears that a major deportation operation was looming.\n\nA day later, a senior immigration official with knowledge of the administration's plans painted a different picture. \"There is no operation next week to pick up millions,\" the official told CNN. \"No clue where he got that impression.\"\n\nBut Trump, who kicked off his 2020 re-election campaign with a rally Tuesday night in Orlando , stood by his tweets and maintained immigration officials were aware of the deportation initiative. \"They know,\" he said. \"They're going to start next week.\"\n\nIt's a familiar contradiction for Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who co-authored a 2017 analysis of Trump's presidency titled \"Hitting the wall: On immigration, campaign promises clash with policy realities.\"\n\n\"This whole area of immigration is one where there's just a vast gap,\" she said, \"between the president's hysterical pronouncements and the reality on the ground and the capacity of the federal government.\"\n\nAsking for a budget boost\n\nAccording to Immigration and Customs Enforcement statistics, deportations increased about 13% between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018, when 256,085 people were deported. That's still significantly less than the number of people deported during fiscal year 2012, when President Barack Obama's administration deported more than 400,000 people.\n\nStaffing limitations and budget constraints generally limit how many people the US can detain and deport -- and how quickly that process happens. Deporting millions of people would cost far more than Immigration and Customs Enforcement's current budget allows.\n\nIn an emergency budget request made last month , the White House is seeking $4.5 billion more from Congress \"to address the immediate humanitarian and security crisis at the southern border of the United States,\" including $33.7 million more to fund ICE transportation and removal, and more than $340 million to fund thousands more beds in immigrant detention facilities.\n\nBut that request is still making its way through Congress -- and it's likely to face pushback, particularly from House Democrats who've repeatedly noted their concerns about the Trump administration's approach to immigration enforcement.\n\nAn 'atmosphere of fear'\n\nICE's acting director said earlier this month that the agency was exploring options to arrest and deport families who had gone through their legal proceedings and been ordered to depart the US. And the senior immigration official told CNN Tuesday that there is a tentative plan for a July operation that would target families who didn't show up at their immigration hearings and have removal orders.\n\nAnother official told CNN more than \"1 million\" undocumented immigrants \"have been issued final deportation orders by federal judges yet remain at large in the country.\" That senior administration official called enforcing those judicial orders a \"top priority\" for ICE.\n\nBut it's unclear what will happen next.\n\nRegardless, Trump's comments will likely instill more fear in communities that are already reeling, said Donald Kerwin, director of the Center for Migration Studies.\n\n\"The administration has created this atmosphere of fear in immigrant communities,\" he said. \"Something like this is certainly designed to ratchet up the fear on the one hand, and on the other hand, appeal to people that want to see immigrants fearful.\"\n\nAdvocates argue that just because something hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it couldn't.\n\n\"ICE has been more than willing in the past to bust through its budget and find creative ways to pad their budget, overspend the money they're given and then go begging for more after they've spent it,\" said Ur Jaddou, a former chief counsel at US Citizenship and Immigration Services who now directs the watchdog group DHS Watch.\n\nAnd authorities don't need to deport millions of people in order to send a message, Jaddou said.\n\n\"To sow fear and gain political points with his base, he only needs to say that, and then go after a lot more people than anyone has ever done, a lot more rooted families,\" Jaddou said. \"All they need to do is go after a few thousand, and that will sow the fear that they are wanting to sew and gain the points that he wants to gain from his base.\"",

        "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Monday night issued a vague threat to deport \"millions\" of undocumented immigrants next week, falling short of providing any additional details and surprising officials within his own administration.\n\nTrump said in a pair of tweets thatthe agency will begin deporting undocumented immigrants \"as fast as they come in,\" and called on congressional Democrats to address the \"Border Crisis.\" It wasn't immediately clear what plan Trump was talking about.\n\n\"Not a lot of happy faces\" around the Department of Homeland Security, a senior administration official told CNN, as the President essentially announced an operation before it was put into action.\n\nTrump insisted Tuesday that top immigration officials are aware of the deportation initiative he referenced in his tweets.\n\n\"They know,\" Trump said when asked by CNN's Pamela Brown about immigration officials who said they were caught off guard by the tweets.\n\n\"They're going to start next week,\" Trump continued. \"When people come in illegally, they have to go out. Everybody is seeing that.\"\n\nThe tweets came hours before the President is set to officially kick off his 2020 bid . He launched his 2016 campaign vowing to take a hard stance against illegal immigration by building a wall and removing undocumented immigrants from the country, but deporting millions of people, as Trump suggested Monday, requires vast resources and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, DHS' enforcement arm, is already strained by migrants crossing the border illegally.\n\n....long before they get to our Southern Border. Guatemala is getting ready to sign a Safe-Third Agreement. The only ones who won't do anything are the Democrats in Congress. They must vote to get rid of the loopholes, and fix asylum! If so, Border Crisis will end quickly! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2019\n\nThe senior administration official said the department is in the planning phase for an operation aimed at stepping up the deportation of undocumented immigrants. The expected operation will be on a \"different scale\" than what the public has previously seen from the department, the official said, as it will target undocumented families. The Obama administration also targeted families in the later years.\n\nThe upcoming operation will also focus on work site enforcement as well as apprehending violent criminals who are in the country illegally, the official added. \"A broad section of things,\" the official said. Still, the official noted the operation is \"not imminent\" and remains in the planning stage.\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan declined to comment to CNN on the President's tweets as he left a speaking engagement Tuesday morning.\n\nAnother senior administration official told CNN on Tuesday that more than \"1 million\" undocumented immigrants \"have been issued final deportation orders by federal judges yet remain at large in the country\" and called enforcing those judicial orders a \"top priority\" for ICE.\n\n\"The border crisis doesn't start and stop at the border, which is why ICE will continue to conduct interior enforcement without exemption for those who are in violation of federal immigration law,\" ICE said in a statement Tuesday. \"This includes routine targeted enforcement operations, criminals, individuals subject to removal orders, and worksite enforcement. This is about addressing the border crisis by upholding the rule of law and maintaining the integrity of the immigration system, as created by Congress.\"\n\nThere are around 52,000 single adults in ICE custody overall, the majority of whom are coming from the border. But DHS is unable to deport all those who are ordered to be removed from the country, given limited resources.\n\nICE's new acting director, Mark Morgan, said earlier this month that agency was exploring options to arrest and deport families who have gone through their legal proceedings and have been ordered to depart the US. That operation would target migrants with a \"final order of removal,\" Morgan said.\n\nMorgan described the potential deportation of families as a way to reduce the incentive for migrants to travel to the United States. Families are often released into the US following their apprehension, due to limits on the time children can be held in government custody.\n\nFormer Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen had rejected the plan because the policy of the department was to prioritize criminals for deportation, according to one US official.\n\nUnder former President Barack Obama, the department had deployed an operation targeting families in the later years. It was revived in Trump's first year in office.\n\nCNN first reported that the Trump administration was considering deporting migrant families with court-ordered removals. The administration had been looking at Obama-era policies such as Operation Border Guardian/Border Resolve, which targeted family units for removal amid an uptick in families and unaccompanied minors attempting to cross the border.\n\nThe increasing number of apprehensions at the southern border, and makeup of those apprehensions, has overwhelmed the Department of Homeland Security. In May, nearly 133,000 migrants were arrested for illegally crossing the border, more than 11,000 of whom were unaccompanied children, according to Customs and Border Protection data\n\nWhile the administration argues deportations will stanch the flow of migrants to the border, it's unclear whether the President's tweet will upend any future operation.\n\nLast year, the President expressed frustration toward Oakland, California, Mayor Libby Schaaf after she issued a public warning for the immigrant communities in her city about impending raids by ICE in the the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n\"They had close to a thousand people ready to be gotten, ready to be taken off the streets ... they say 85% of them were criminals and had criminal records. And the mayor of Oakland went out and warned them all,\" Trump said at the time, adding that her actions were a \"disgrace.\"",

The President, adamant on doubling down on illegal immigration, has repeatedly tweeted about an impending operation, a striking move given that operations are not announced ahead of time.\n\nIt comes in the middle of another tumultuous week at the White House, with controversy surrounding Labor Secretary Alex Acosta and concerns about upcoming testimony of former special counsel Robert Mueller.

        "text": "Washington (CNN) More people have been apprehended illegally crossing the US-Mexico border this fiscal year than in any year since 2009, according to Customs and Border Protection.\n\nBetween October and April, the US Border Patrol apprehended 460,294 people for illegally crossing into the US from the southern border.\n\n\"I expect we will surpass 500,000 this weekend,\" Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost told a Senate panel Wednesday. \"Our apprehension numbers are off the charts compared to recent years.\"\n\nIn 2009, agents made 540,865 apprehensions on the southern border for the full fiscal year. Every year since then, apprehensions have remained below the half-million mark.\n\nLast month, 98,977 people were apprehended at the southern border, marking yet another increase.\n\n\"Just a few days into May, this trend shows no signs of slowing down,\" a Department of Homeland Security official said Tuesday. \"In the past 10 days, Border Patrol has apprehended over 33,000 individuals on the Southwest border. These numbers have caused us to surpass the FY totals for every single year since 2009 in just over seven months.\"\n\n\"What makes these numbers so dramatically different than anything we've ever faced in the history of Border Patrol is the demographic,\" the official said. There continue to be record numbers of families and children arriving predominantly from the Northern triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, with over 58,000 family members apprehended on the southern border in April.\n\nAround 8,800 unaccompanied children were also taken into custody last month.\n\nThe high numbers and demographic makeup of migrants arriving at the border are causing \"dire concerns,\" said the official.\n\nAccording to the official, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Health and Human Services, which is tasked with caring for unaccompanied migrant children, lack sufficient bed space to keep up with the apprehensions, forcing migrants to be held for extended periods in short-term holding facilities.\n\n\"This is dangerously elevating the time in custody and poses serious, significant safety risks\" to agents as well as migrants, said the official.\n\nAdditionally, the Border Patrol has released over 32,000 family members to nongovernmental organizations and at bus stations.\n\n\"We know that the continued release of family units will only continue to increase the pull factors, however, we have no other options,\" said the DHS official, who added that \"single adult bed space is now a critical issue.\"\n\nSimilarly, ICE has released 168,000 family members from its custody since Dec. 21, 2018, and has surged personnel and resources to assist with the border mission.\n\n\"This shift obviously has a negative impact on our public safety efforts,\" ICE acting Director Matthew Albence said Tuesday. \"Unfortunately, those officers are no longer there to take custody of these individuals or make these arrests.\"\n\nAlbence said that ICE's \"most meaningful\" civil immigration enforcement statistics are all down by double digits this year as a result.\n\n\"In fact our convicted criminal arrests are down 14%, as a direct result of having to support what's going on at the border. While we keep talking about this being a border crisis, it's really more than that. It's a crisis for this entire country,\" he added.\n\nTo address the influx, Customs and Border Protection has also shifted \"large portions\" of personnel and resources to the southern border, including 545 customs officers from ports of entry and 325 agents from other locations.\n\nCurrently, 40% to 60% of Border Patrol manpower is dedicated to the care, feeding, processing and hospital watch of migrants, according to DHS officials.\n\nBorder Patrol has also canceled training, increased overtime hours, brought agents back from \"valuable task forces\" and shut down checkpoints.\n\nOffice of Refugee Resettlement Director Jonathan Hayes warned lawmakers at a Senate hearing Wednesday of the ramifications if the program is not provided additional funding soon.\n\n\"Without additional funding, there is a significant likelihood that the UAC program will exhaust all of its resources in June, in which case HHS may need to reallocate more funds from refugees and victims of trafficking and torture, and scale back services,\" Hayes said in his statement to the Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"In the worst-case scenario, thousands of children might remain for lengthy periods of time in DHS facilities that were never intended to be long-term shelters, rather than being expeditiously transferred to HHS custody, where they would receive case management and other services that address their unique needs,\" he added.\n\nRoughly 8,700 unaccompanied children were turned over to the office last month, more than double the number of children compared to the previous April, a senior agency official told CNN. The number of border apprehensions is not a direct correlation, but it still impacts the capacity in HHS facilities.\n\nThe White House supplemental request recently sent to Congress asked for an increase in shelter capacity to accommodate the high number of unaccompanied children.",

        "text": "Washington (CNN) Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Friday that it appears there will be a 25% decrease in June in numbers of migrants crossing at the US-Mexico border .\n\nMore than 144,000 migrants had been encountered or arrested at the US-Mexico border in May , the highest monthly total in 13 years.\n\nMcAleenan credited Trump administration initiatives, especially the increase in interdictions by Mexico over the past three weeks and the return of some asylum seekers to Mexico for the duration of their immigration proceeds, a program McAleenan says is being expanded.\n\nThat program, however, is being fought in court, including by a union representing asylum officers which opposes the initiative.\n\nA dip in border crossings is common during the hot summer months, though McAleenan downplayed the role of seasonal trends in migration, saying that he expects to be able to tell by late July if these initiatives will have a sustained impact.\n\nOver recent months, there's been a dramatic spike in apprehensions at the southern border, particularly of families and unaccompanied minors -- overwhelming the administration and prompting a request for emergency funding to the border.\n\nOn Thursday, the House passed a $4.6 billion Senate bill to send emergency funding to the border, a vote that triggered outrage from progressives who objected to the legislation and an outpouring of emotion on the House floor. The measure, which passed 305-102, will next go to the White House for President Donald Trump's signature.\n\nMcAleenan lauded the Hill's bipartisan passage of the funding bill which he said he hopes the President will sign next week.\n\nThe measure comes against the backdrop of media reports of perilous conditions at border facilities . A team of doctors, lawyers and advocates warned of what they said were major health and hygiene problems at several US Customs and Border Protection facilities in Texas, including a station in Clint.\n\nMcAleenan reiterated Friday that he has warned of overcrowding in border facilities for months, but also pushed back strongly on what he termed \"unsubstantiated\" reports about the Clint, Texas, facility where he says children are receiving supplies such as blankets and toothbrushes, despite claims to the contrary.\n\nThe lawyers have since asked a federal judge to hold the Trump administration in contempt and to order immediate improvements to conditions at Customs and Border Protection facilities where children are being held.\n\nSpotlighting the risks and tragedy on the border, McAleenan said the young girl who drowned beside her father trying to cross the Rio Grande River into the US was the fourth child to die attempting to cross in the past week.\n\nThe \"situation should not be acceptable to any of us,\" he said.\n\nA lull for nonprofit shelters too\n\nIn the Rio Grande Valley sector of Texas, the busiest region for migrant arrests on the southern border, those running nearby nonprofit shelters have seen a lull over the past week, but weren't sure it would last.\n\nThe Salvation Army of McAllen/Hidalgo County serves as an overflow facility to house and feed migrants when the primary nonprofit shelters in the region are full.\n\n\"Last week we had an overflow,\" said Maggie Pena, business operations manager. \"But the numbers have decreased this week.\"\n\nShe said what the migrants need the most when they arrive, is a hot meal and shower, and \"somebody to understand,\" added Alvin J. Migues, regional emergency disaster services director.\n\nOn Tuesday, 11 migrants were brought to Good Neighbor Settlement House, which serves as the primary overnight shelter in Brownsville, Texas, for migrants who are released from government custody before they travel to their destinations throughout the US, said Marianela Ramirez-Watson, the Refugee Respite Program.\n\nThat's much fewer than the 60 to 90 people a day the small facility has been receiving.\n\nOn Wednesday, when CNN visited the shelter, a couple and their 3-year-old daughter Ariceli were inside, a few hours before they were destined to travel to South Carolina.\n\n\"We are hoping to give her a better life,\" her father said in Spanish. \"And get good medical treatment.\"\n\nAriceli's parents, who had fled El Salvador in fear of a gang initiation a few years ago, were living and working in Mexico, but crossed the Rio Grande earlier this week seeking better medical care for their daughter. The toddler, who couldn't hold herself up, had microcephaly, stemming from a Zika infection her mother had during pregnancy.\n\nThe \"happy ending\" isn't at the shelter, but \"when they leave us and go with family,\" said Ramirez-Watson.\n\nThis story has been updated.",

        "text": "(CNN) President Donald Trump said tariffs on Mexican goods are \"indefinitely suspended\" after negotiators from the US and Mexico were able to reach a deal on immigration enforcement.\n\n\"I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico,\" Trump tweeted Friday. \"The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended.\"\n\nThe announcement was a dramatic reversal of a sudden tariff threat that Trump himself announced last week in an attempt to put more pressure on the Mexican government to stem the flow of migrants into the US. Trump spent much of the intervening period out of the country, visiting with European leaders and attending a state dinner in the United Kingdom, while US and Mexican negotiators worked feverishly in Washington to avoid another escalation in his foreign trade wars.\n\nTrump has leaned on tariffs as a favorite bargaining mechanism, including in his ongoing dispute with China, with mixed results, and his Mexico threats drew open opposition from top Republican senators as well as blowback from the business community.\n\nHis decision to back off three days of intense discussions in Washington between Mexican officials and the Trump administration, with talks between Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard and State Department officials lasting for more than 11 hours Friday.\n\nTrump had threatened to impose tariffs on all Mexican goods entering the US if Mexico did not limit the number of Central American migrants moving through the country to the US. He said late Friday, after he had returned to the White House from his visit to Europe for D-Day commemorations , that the Mexican officials had agreed to his demands.\n\n\"Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border,\" Trump tweeted. \"This is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States. Details of the agreement will be released shortly by the State Department. Thank you!\"\n\nTrump's assertion was met with derision from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has crossed swords with the President repeatedly over immigration -- particularly over Trump's demands for money to build a border wall, which triggered a record-long government shutdown last fall.\n\nLate Friday, the New York Democrat tweeted: \"This is an historic night! @realDonaldTrump has announced that he has cut a deal to 'greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.' Now that that problem is solved, I'm sure we won't be hearing any more about it in the future.\"\n\nOn Saturday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded to the latest development with Mexico, saying in a statement that Trump \"undermined America's preeminent leadership role in the world by recklessly threatening to impose tariffs on our close friend and neighbor to the south.\" Congress, she said, will hold the White House \"accountable for its failures to address the humanitarian situation at our southern border.\"\n\n\"We are deeply disappointed by the Administration's expansion of its failed Remain-in-Mexico policy, which violates the rights of asylum seekers under US law and fails to address the root causes of Central American migration,\" Pelosi said.\n\nBut Trump earlier Saturday criticized media coverage and said \"the reviews and reporting on our Border Immigration Agreement with Mexico have been very good\" in a series of morning tweets.\n\n\"Mexico will try very hard, and if they do that, this will be a very successful agreement for both the United States and Mexico!\" the President wrote in a tweet . He continued later Saturday: \"MEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!\"\n\nA declaration amid a crisis\n\nThe United States and Mexico signed onto a joint declaration as a result of the negotiations. The State Department said in a statement that as part of the agreement, Mexico will take \"unprecedented steps\" to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration, including the deployment of its National Guard throughout the country -- giving priority to Mexico's southern border.\n\nThe countries also agreed that individuals caught crossing into the US from Mexico seeking asylum will be \"rapidly returned\" to Mexico where they will await consideration of their asylum claims. Mexico, the declaration says, will authorize the entrance of all of those individuals. Mexico says it will offer jobs, health care and education to those people. In return, the US must expedite the asylum adjudication process.\n\nThe declaration also reiterates the countries' commitment from last year, which emphasizes US support for development in Central America and southern Mexico.\n\nHowever, the agreement does not include requiring asylum seekers to first apply for asylum in the US while in Mexico.\n\nWhile the US got what it wanted from Mexico in terms of border enforcement and breaking up trafficking networks, the US did not get Mexico to agree to have asylum seekers from Central America face asylum proceedings in Mexico or the first country they cross through, rather than in the US.\n\nDiscussions will continue and the two countries may announce further efforts within the next 90 days if necessary, the statement said.\n\nThe deal comes amid a surge in migrants crossing into the US, straining the resources of federal immigration and border authorities. More than 144,000 migrants were encountered or arrested at the US-Mexico border in May, US Customs and Border Protection said this week , a roughly 32% increase from the previous month and the highest monthly total in more than a decade.\n\nOf those, nearly 133,000 crossed the US-Mexico border illegally, including more than 11,000 unaccompanied children.\n\nMexico has already pledged to send about 6,000 National Guard troops to its southern border with Guatemala in a bid to cut off the flow of Central American migrants whose journey to the US's southern border has led to the steep spike in border crossings in recent months.\n\nBut US officials demanded more.\n\nUS officials pressed Mexico to change its asylum policy by entering into a \"safe third country\" agreement with the US. Mexico had rejected those offers in the past, but US officials said Mexico was more open to some version of this idea in talks on Thursday. The goal was to require Central American migrants to face asylum proceedings in Mexico or the first country they cross through, rather than in the US.\n\nMexican officials, meanwhile, urged the US to address the root causes of Central American migration by investing in programs that would reduce poverty and violence in those countries. Trump, though, moved earlier this year to cut US foreign aid to those countries , a move even US officials say is counterproductive.\n\nDiplomats celebrate avoiding tariff confrontation\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday night praised his counterpart in the Mexican Foreign Ministry, thanking Ebrard and his team for their hard work in negotiating a deal.\n\n\"We would like to thank Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard for his hard work to negotiate a set of joint obligations that benefit both the United States and Mexico,\" Pompeo said in a statement. \"The United States looks forward to working alongside Mexico to fulfill these commitments so that we can stem the tide of illegal migration across our southern border and to make our border strong and secure.\"\n\nMexican Ambassador to the US Martha Barcena also praised Ebrard, and said the deal would address what she called a humanitarian crisis on the border.\n\n\"Mexico will strengthen the measures for the implementation of its immigration law. Provide job, education and health opportunities for people who wait in Mexican territory for the end of their asylum process in the US,\" Barcena tweeted.\n\nIn a news conference following the announcement of the declaration, Ebrard told reporters that it was a fair deal. He said that the Mexican delegation had moderated some of the US' requests, such as a safe third country agreement, which would require asylum seekers traveling through Mexico to make their case for American asylum in Mexico. But Mexico did allow others, such as an expansion to Section 235(b)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act that would return asylum seekers to Mexico for the duration of their immigration proceedings.\n\n\"I think it is a fair balance because they have more drastic measures and proposals at the start and we reached some middle point,\" he said. \"For instance, they accepted to support the program that Mexico proposed in Central America. They proposed in the first meeting to have (a) third safe state, which is not the case here, which is very important. And on the other hand, we accepted to have a more extended version of 235 and to accelerate the deployment of the national guard. So it's a fair play, I think.\"\n\nDays of pressured negotiations\n\nAdministration officials had said earlier Friday that they were prepared to move forward with the threatened tariffs on Mexico , even as negotiations continued in Washington over addressing the immigration issues at the heart of the standoff.\n\nThe Trump administration was expected to submit legal notification on Friday of its intention to implement tariffs Monday on Mexico , Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Marc Short said. But Short said Trump could \"turn that off\" over the weekend if negotiations \"continue to go well,\" which appeared to be the route Trump chose Friday.\n\n\"There's a legal notification that goes forward today with a plan to implement tariffs on Monday, but I think there is the ability -- if negotiations continue to go well -- that the President can turn that off at some point over the weekend,\" Short had told reporters at the White House on Friday morning.\n\nTrump faced a Friday deadline to sign an executive order to ensure the tariffs go into effect by Monday, his deadline for Mexico to meet his immigration demands or face a 5% tariff on all exports to the US.\n\nTrump on Thursday had said \"a lot of progress was made\" earlier this week in talks with Mexican officials, but repeatedly stood by his vow to impose the tariffs, despite criticism from some Republicans, who have urged him to delay the implementation.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers had expressed concern about the impact of tariffs on all goods that cross into the US from Mexico, a move that could ultimately lead to higher prices for US consumers and hurt US businesses as well as the Mexican economy.\n\nShort hit back at the uneasy Republican lawmakers earlier Friday.\n\n\"We wish that members of Congress would spend as much time looking to fix the problem legislatively as they do bellyaching about what the President is doing trying to fix the problem,\" Short said when asked about Republican opposition to his tariffs.\n\nShort said specifically that the administration wants Congress to change US asylum laws that \"allow families to basically come across the border and be protected and let go into our United States until the adjudication process completes.\"\n\nThis story has been updated.",

Another source said there are ongoing discussions within the department. A separate source tells CNN no immediate action is being taken.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, suffering from a lack of resources, is unable to deport all those who are ordered to be removed from the country and has said it focuses on the people it deems the most dangerous.\n\nHowever, that could change as a massive influx of migrant families make their way into the country illegally over the southern border.\n\nAs part of the consideration, the administration has been looking at an operation rolled out in the late years of Barack Obama's presidency -- and revived in President Donald Trump's first year in office -- that also targeted family units. Obama initially focused on felons.\n\nRead More",

        "text": "(CNN) It's an alarm immigrant rights groups have been sounding since the day President Trump took office.\n\nTrump himself suggested well before his January 2017 inauguration that he planned to deport millions of people, telling \"60 Minutes\" days after his election that millions of criminals would be kicked out of the US once he was at the helm.\n\nBut while the number of deportations have increased since he took office, the mass deportations he warned of haven't materialized.\n\nTrump's tweets Monday, threatening that \"millions\" of undocumented immigrants would be deported next week , revived fears that a major deportation operation was looming.\n\nA day later, a senior immigration official with knowledge of the administration's plans painted a different picture. \"There is no operation next week to pick up millions,\" the official told CNN. \"No clue where he got that impression.\"\n\nBut Trump, who kicked off his 2020 re-election campaign with a rally Tuesday night in Orlando , stood by his tweets and maintained immigration officials were aware of the deportation initiative. \"They know,\" he said. \"They're going to start next week.\"\n\nIt's a familiar contradiction for Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who co-authored a 2017 analysis of Trump's presidency titled \"Hitting the wall: On immigration, campaign promises clash with policy realities.\"\n\n\"This whole area of immigration is one where there's just a vast gap,\" she said, \"between the president's hysterical pronouncements and the reality on the ground and the capacity of the federal government.\"\n\nAsking for a budget boost\n\nAccording to Immigration and Customs Enforcement statistics, deportations increased about 13% between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018, when 256,085 people were deported. That's still significantly less than the number of people deported during fiscal year 2012, when President Barack Obama's administration deported more than 400,000 people.\n\nStaffing limitations and budget constraints generally limit how many people the US can detain and deport -- and how quickly that process happens. Deporting millions of people would cost far more than Immigration and Customs Enforcement's current budget allows.\n\nIn an emergency budget request made last month , the White House is seeking $4.5 billion more from Congress \"to address the immediate humanitarian and security crisis at the southern border of the United States,\" including $33.7 million more to fund ICE transportation and removal, and more than $340 million to fund thousands more beds in immigrant detention facilities.\n\nBut that request is still making its way through Congress -- and it's likely to face pushback, particularly from House Democrats who've repeatedly noted their concerns about the Trump administration's approach to immigration enforcement.\n\nAn 'atmosphere of fear'\n\nICE's acting director said earlier this month that the agency was exploring options to arrest and deport families who had gone through their legal proceedings and been ordered to depart the US. And the senior immigration official told CNN Tuesday that there is a tentative plan for a July operation that would target families who didn't show up at their immigration hearings and have removal orders.\n\nAnother official told CNN more than \"1 million\" undocumented immigrants \"have been issued final deportation orders by federal judges yet remain at large in the country.\" That senior administration official called enforcing those judicial orders a \"top priority\" for ICE.\n\nBut it's unclear what will happen next.\n\nRegardless, Trump's comments will likely instill more fear in communities that are already reeling, said Donald Kerwin, director of the Center for Migration Studies.\n\n\"The administration has created this atmosphere of fear in immigrant communities,\" he said. \"Something like this is certainly designed to ratchet up the fear on the one hand, and on the other hand, appeal to people that want to see immigrants fearful.\"\n\nAdvocates argue that just because something hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it couldn't.\n\n\"ICE has been more than willing in the past to bust through its budget and find creative ways to pad their budget, overspend the money they're given and then go begging for more after they've spent it,\" said Ur Jaddou, a former chief counsel at US Citizenship and Immigration Services who now directs the watchdog group DHS Watch.\n\nAnd authorities don't need to deport millions of people in order to send a message, Jaddou said.\n\n\"To sow fear and gain political points with his base, he only needs to say that, and then go after a lot more people than anyone has ever done, a lot more rooted families,\" Jaddou said. \"All they need to do is go after a few thousand, and that will sow the fear that they are wanting to sew and gain the points that he wants to gain from his base.\"",
