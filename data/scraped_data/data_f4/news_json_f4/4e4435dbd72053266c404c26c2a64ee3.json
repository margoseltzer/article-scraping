        "text": "TrendMicro CEO Donald Luskin sounded worse than Marie Antoinette when he lectured struggling Americans who work two jobs and can’t afford to retire to count their blessings and think of it as “heaven” if they are not starving.\n\nHost Charles Payne seemed to understand that it's a problem that the country has a large segment of financially struggling Americans. But rather than come right out and say so, he suggested it was “up for debate.”\n\nPAYNE: Well, retirement inching closer or becoming a thing of the past for a lot of Americans. In fact, a recent poll finds nearly one in four people don't expect to ever leave the workforce. This, as the number of people working multiple jobs also spiking. So why are so many people financially unfit to call it quits? Well, It's up for debate.\n\nPayne acknowledged that such polls are “always alarming.” But hinting that maybe there's no need for alarm, Payne asked Luskin, “Is that worrisome for you, Donald?”\n\nThe shockingly out-of-touch Luskin went beyond “Let them eat cake” to “They should be grateful to eat cake all the time.”\n\nLUSKIN: It doesn't worry me personally. I guess I'm one of those people who plans never to retire. I mean, I got to tell you, what do people do when they retire? You know, how do you spend a day? I mean, is bowling that interesting? Is fishing that interesting? I happen to love my work. Why would I want to stop it? It’s not like it hurts. Why would I stop it? This is great! What a great country where we have the opportunity to keep working! What a miracle where our lives are long enough and we're healthy enough and mentally alert enough so that we don't have to retire like generations before us! This is a great blessing. You should embrace it!\n\nAs The Young Turks pointed out, half the workforce doesn’t have the kind of cushy job Luskin has but jobs that require “heavy work” or “medium work.” I'd love to see Luskin \"embrace\" that kind of work for himself in his 70s.\n\nLuskin acknowledged that not having enough money to retire if you want to is a problem - but probably because you’ve been a naughty spender!\n\nIn a condescending voice Luskin “asked,” “Were you the profligate grasshopper instead of the ant who saved up? I mean, were you just messing around when you were a kid and didn’t contribute enough to your 401(k) or did the economy just fail to provide a job for you? It’s hard to know.”\n\nOr, did you get laid off in your later years? Suffer a health crisis that ate up your savings? Have some kind of family emergency? A recent Washington Post article dug into why 40% of Americans struggle to pay their current bills and it’s not because they are profligate. It’s because of low wages that have not kept pace with rising expenses for housing, health care and education as well as increased levels of personal debt. “In discussions with 30 Americans unable to pay all of their bills, a clear pattern emerged: Most were able to eke by until they faced an unexpected crisis such as a job loss, cancer, car trouble or storm damage,” reporter Heather Long noted.\n\nBut to a fatcat like Luskin, everything is peachy from his 1% perch and, if not – why, it’s your fault and not his problem!\n\n“All I can say is that we have – we’re very close to what is statistically full employment right now which means that anybody who wants a job can have a job,” Luskin said smugly. Notice he said nothing about anybody having a job that will provide for a middle class lifestyle. Or keep you from having to choose between daycare and a family car.\n\nThen he went “back to the blessing part of it.”\n\nLUSKIN: It is part of your destiny to be productive and to work. And that means different things to different people. But it is a blessing and you should embrace it. Even if you didn’t save properly and you now see yourself between a rock and a hard place, find the blessing in it. Think how great it is that you live in a time where you can work.\n\nPayne didn’t seem quite on board. He quickly opined that some people may work two jobs because they want the “flexibility of working for Uber and Lyft.” But he said a lot is also because of “economic circumstances or dire economic circumstances as well.” He asked if it might be “worrisome” that in a booming economy the prosperity is not “trickling down” to everyone.\n\nNope, Luskin thinks that’s “like going to heaven, baby.”\n\nLUSKIN: No, what would be worrisome to me is that if you had these people where their initial starting point is “Oh, my God, I didn’t save enough, I can’t afford to retire, and they couldn’t get a job or a second job, right? … Do you want to be able to work two jobs or do you want to starve? Because between those two alternatives, working two jobs is like going to heaven, baby. That sounds great to me.\n\nWatch the hideous elitism below, from the Fox Business Network's July 8, 2019 Making Money, via Media Matters.",

        "text": "\n\nCarl Dunlap and Sommer Johnson in May at the home they rent in Douglasville, Ga. (Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\n\nSommer Johnson thought everything was finally coming together for her last year. She was engaged, working full time and doing well in online college classes when her fiance’s mother died a week before their wedding day — triggering a series of large and unexpected expenses that left her struggling to pay her bills and brought her to the verge of bankruptcy.\n\n“I keep hearing this is one of the best economies we’ve ever had and unemployment is down, especially among African Americans, which I am,” said Johnson, 39, who lives in Douglasville, Ga., an Atlanta suburb. “I’m looking around going, ‘Where is this boom?’ From where I sit, this doesn’t look like the best economy ever.”\n\nThe economic expansion this week became the longest in U.S. history, surpassing the 1990s boom, which lasted exactly a decade.\n\nThe stock market is at record levels, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at a new high Wednesday ahead of the July 4 holiday, and President Trump has made the economy’s strong performance a centerpiece of his reelection campaign.\n\nBut this expansion has been weaker and its benefits distributed far more unevenly than in previous growth cycles, leaving many Americans in a vulnerable position.\n\n[How healthy is the U.S. economy? Here’s what 7 key indicators reveal.]\n\nThis is a “two-tier recovery,” said Matthew Mish, head of credit strategy at the investment bank UBS. About 60 percent of Americans have benefited financially, he said, while 40 percent have not.\n\nThe 40 percent — which Mish calls the “lower tier” — have seen paltry or volatile wage growth, rising expenses for housing, health care and education, and increased levels of personal debt. They tend not to own homes or many stocks.\n\nIn discussions with 30 Americans unable to pay all of their bills, a clear pattern emerged: Most were able to eke by until they faced an unexpected crisis such as a job loss, cancer, car trouble or storm damage.\n\nThe extra expense caused them to get behind on their bills, and they never fully rebounded.\n\nEconomists fear such precarious financial situations put many Americans at risk if there is even a mild setback in the economy, potentially setting up the next recession to be worse than anything in recent history except the Great Recession.\n\n“So many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck,” said Signe-Mary McKernan, vice president of the Center on Labor, Human Services and Population at the Urban Institute. “We are headed toward a political crisis, if not an economic one.”\n\n[Why nearly 350,000 workers in mostly red states aren’t seeing wage increases, even though their local lawmakers passed them]\n\nTheir vulnerability is due to a confluence of factors. First, the average American family has yet to recover fully from the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve found, leaving half the nation with a diminished cushion to handle surprise expenses — or the next downturn.\n\nThe bottom half has less wealth today, after adjusting for inflation, than it did in 1989, according to Fed data through March of this year.\n\nWhile wage growth has accelerated in recent months, especially for the lowest-paid workers, families who have struggled for years have a ways to go to return to solid footing.\n\n\n\nSommer Johnson works a full-time job, takes online classes toward a degree in business administration and is a mom to two teenagers and an infant. (Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\n\nHalf of U.S. jobs pay less than $18.58 an hour and more than a third pay less than $15, which makes it difficult to save or invest for a better future.\n\nTrump and his team argue that a strong economy is lifting more and more Americans up financially, including blue-collar workers, the formerly incarcerated and minorities. In contrast, Democrats are calling for major expansions of government programs to address inequality. How to help the economically vulnerable is likely to be a key debate in the 2020 race.\n\n“Just because folks on Wall Street think things are fine doesn’t mean most Americans feel like things are fine,” said Ray Boshara, director of the Center for Household Financial Stability at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “When every day is a rainy day for millions of families, things are not fine.”\n\nTo get by, Americans have borrowed heavily in recent years. Total U.S. household debt is now $13.7 trillion, surpassing the 2008 peak in dollar terms, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The surge in debt this time around is for cars and college, not mortgages.\n\nJohnson knows these issues all too well. Her family of five — including two teenagers and an infant daughter — was making it on her $31,000 salary as an insurance underwriting assistant and her husband’s part-time job as a clerk. But it took longer to sell her mother-in-law’s house than the couple expected.\n\nThe modest life insurance policy the couple collected on her death soon ran out, but the bills — for the funeral, carrying the extra house, rent, health insurance and the new baby — kept coming. Johnson’s husband, Carl Dunlap, has applied repeatedly for full-time jobs but has not been able to get one. He picked up as many extra hours as he could at work, but it wasn’t enough.\n\n[‘A constant state of drowning:’ On Post Reports, Heather Long talks to the Americans who don’t feel lifted by a strong economy]\n\nAlready in debt for college and a used Volkswagen Passat she bought in 2017, Johnson turned to friends and family for help. But she eventually had to choose between paying for day care and the $350-a-month auto loan. She picked day care, and her family lost a vehicle.\n\nShe recalls the exact moment it happened: 10 p.m. on a Thursday night in early March. She saw the red flashing lights of the repo men through her living-room window and ran outside barefoot.\n\n“I just stood there and watched it go, which was tough,” Johnson said. “That was the first car I ever bought for myself, and we needed it.”\n\n\n\nJohnson shops with her daughter Harmonii in Douglasville. (Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\n\n\n\nJohnson and Dunlap drive to a ceremony at her university honoring students for their grades. (Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\n\nJohnson takes Harmonii out of her car. “Where is this boom?” Johnson says of her vantage point on the U.S. economy. (Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\n\nThe couple carpool to work now, trying to save money to pay the thousands of dollars they still owe on the VW that is no longer in their possession.\n\nOlder and wealthier — and usually white — Americans typically take on debt to buy homes or make investments that are likely to make them richer in the years to come. Most in this category have recovered the wealth they lost in the Great Recession as home prices and stocks have soared.\n\nIn contrast, data from the Fed show that families of color and Americans born after 1970 are the least likely to have recovered the wealth they lost in the crisis. Households earning less than $60,000 also tend to carry heavy debt loads, according to data from credit-score company Equifax, often taking out loans for college, which they cannot get rid of in bankruptcy, or loans to pay bills, which can put them further behind.\n\n[Kamala D. Harris changes answer on abolishing private health insurance, saying she misheard debate question]\n\nThe prevailing view among Wall Street investors and Washington policymakers is that there is little to worry about because student loans are backed by the government and delinquency rates for other kinds of debt are fairly low, meaning most people can make their monthly payments.\n\n“Credit quality is about as good as I’ve ever seen it,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “There is nothing that suggests inordinate stress on low-income households . . . certainly nothing compared to times past.”\n\nBut Boshara, of the St. Louis Fed, pointed out that credit card and auto loan delinquencies have risen this year, the opposite of what Wall Street expected in good economic times.\n\nFour in 10 Americans say they still struggle to pay their bills, despite the strong economy, according to a quarterly survey by UBS that has shown no improvement since 2014. An April Gallup poll found that 36 percent of Americans were “very” or “moderately” worried about not being able to pay their normal monthly bills, little changed from 2018, but up from 2017 when 31 percent were very or moderately worried. And looking at how households are doing by class, race or age reveals a concerning picture.\n\nFor Maddy Dannemiller, who lives outside Columbus, Ohio, the tipping point came when her then-boyfriend hit a deer while driving her car.\n\nThe vehicle was badly damaged, and the couple decided it was not safe enough for their children, prompting her to buy another.\n\nHer monthly payment jumped to over $450 a month because she didn’t have a credit history. (Dannemiller’s late mother had co-signed the loan on her first car.)\n\nThen the couple broke up, and Dannemiller says she is supporting three children on her own.\n\nAs a nurse’s aide, she makes above Ohio’s $8.55-an-hour minimum wage but not much over $10. Her landlord is a relative who sometimes gives her a break on rent, but she is routinely late on car and credit card payments.\n\n“I’m 25, but I feel like I am in my late 30s,” Dannemiller said, shortly before heading to work. “Right now, I’m two months behind on my car payment.”",

        "text": "Story Highlights 56% rate own financial situation as excellent/good; 57% say it's getting better\n\n56% are currently saving money; 26% just making ends meet\n\nBiggest worries: retirement income and unplanned medical costs\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Gallup readings across several personal economic measures since the beginning of this year confirm that the public has felt the effect of last week's news: The first quarter of 2019 was the strongest first quarter for the U.S. economy since 2015.\n\nAt the start of 2019, Americans' optimism about their personal finances reached levels not seen in more than 16 years, as 69% expected they would be financially better off in a year. Since then, Gallup has seen the following additional indications that the public's confidence in their own financial stability is strong.\n\n1. A majority of Americans, 56%, rate their current financial situation as \"excellent\" (12%) or \"good\" (44%), while 29% rate it as \"only fair\" and 15% as \"poor.\" This overall positive rating has increased 10 percentage points since 2015 and is currently the highest since 2002, though it is statistically unchanged since last year. Likewise, the 57% of Americans who now say their overall financial situation is getting better has risen 10 points since 2016 and is at its highest numerical point since 2002.\n\nBoth questions, which were included in Gallup's April 1-9 Economy and Personal Finance poll, have been asked at least once a year since 2001, and results have fluctuated as the U.S. economy has gone through downturns and recoveries.\n\nAnother April financial reading, Americans' views on whether they have enough money to live comfortably, has been more stable historically, with the \"yes\" responses falling below 65% only once (to 60% in 2012) since 2002, when the measure was at its highest point of 75%. The latest reading is 66% saying they have enough to live comfortably and 33% saying they do not.\n\nAmericans who tend to have more financial resources -- including those with higher household incomes and those who own stocks -- are more likely than their counterparts to rate their own financial situation positively in all three Gallup questions.\n\n2. Two questions -- asked less frequently than the previous three -- gauge U.S. adults' ability to make ends meet and were included in a Feb. 12-28 poll. Overall, just 25% of Americans say they worry \"all\" or \"most\" of the time that their family income will not meet their expenses; 37% worry \"some of the time\"; and 37% \"almost never\" worry. The previous reading for this question, in 2008, found 37% worrying at least most of the time.\n\nAt the same time, 56% of Americans report that they are currently saving money (19% say \"a lot\" and 37% \"a little\"); 26% say they are just making ends meet; and far fewer are drawing on savings (6%) or running into debt (7%). This marks a slight increase in the percentage saying they are saving since the previous reading, in January 2016.\n\nSeveral demographic subgroups show a significant advantage over their counterparts when it comes to worrying less about covering expenses and managing to save money, most notably those with higher household incomes and college graduates.\n\n3. Not having enough money for retirement and not being able to pay for medical care in the event of a serious illness or accident are the most worrisome of eight financial issues for Americans. Slim majorities, 54% and 51%, respectively, report that they are \"very\" or \"moderately\" worried about each of these long-term financial matters in the April poll. Both of the latest readings are at the low end of the historical trend.\n\nAn inability to afford medical costs for normal healthcare and to maintain the standard of living they enjoy rank next in the list, with 42% registering concern about each. Slightly fewer, 36%, are worried about not having enough money to pay their monthly bills, and the same percentage worry about not being able to pay for college for their children. Yet, 65% of parents of children under 18 worry about affording college for their child.\n\nAmericans remain least concerned about being able to pay their housing costs (30%) and making the minimum payments on their credit cards (20%). Since 2001, the rank-order of concerns has been similar to this year's.\n\nGallup uses these data to create a Financial Worry Index, which is based on the number of financial matters respondents say they are \"very\" or \"moderately worried\" about. The score ranges from 0 for those who do not worry about any of the matters to 7 for those who worry about all of them; it does not include the reading for college costs because it was not asked before 2007.\n\nThis year, 22% of Americans are worried about six or seven of the seven items -- putting them in the \"highly worried\" category. Another 24% worry about three to five items and are classified as \"moderately worried.\" The remaining 55% have few financial worries, including 30% who are worried about none of the seven.\n\nA maximum of 51% were highly or moderately worried about their finances from 2001-2007, but that spiked to 61% in 2012. Since then, it has ranged from 46% to 54%. The latest reading marks the lowest level of worry since before the recession.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAlthough Gallup's economic confidence reading faltered in April, Americans remain largely sanguine about their own personal financial situations and more upbeat than in recent years. Majorities rate their own situation positively, think it is getting better on the whole and say they are managing to save money these days. Their most pressing concerns about their own finances continue to be related to retirement and healthcare costs in the event of a medical emergency rather than meeting everyday bills. College-educated adults, those who are employed and those owning stocks are less likely than their counterparts to express concern about their personal economic situations.\n\nContinued positive economic news, including sustained low unemployment and economic growth, are giving Americans some peace of mind about their own finances. As the 2020 presidential election approaches, a robust economy works in President Donald Trump's favor, as history has shown that a strong economy can buoy a sitting president's chances of re-election. Given the sharp political polarization in the U.S. today, Trump's inability to make inroads with Democrats means he will need to appeal to independent voters and will most certainly need economic conditions to remain positive to do so.\n\nView complete question responses and trends.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.",

However, growth is expected to slacken somewhat in the second quarter. (Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe U.S. economy is in an odd place. Jobs are plentiful and the stock market is at record levels, but business leaders are worried enough about the future to pull back on spending. President Trump calls this the “greatest economy” ever, yet he’s also demanding the U.S. central bank inject more stimulus into the economy ASAP, something that typically happens only when a lot of yellow and red flags appear.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus among experts is that the U.S. economy is slowing after a pretty hot 2018. But there’s heated debate over how fast it’s cooling. Some argue that by the end of this year the U.S. economy is likely to look and feel a lot as it did in 2016: decent but not great. Others say the nation is likely to slip into a moderate downturn akin to those in 1990 or 2001. (The White House is adamant that there’s no slowing).\n\n[Trump may be about to face his biggest test yet on the economy]\n\nThe Washington Post asked top economic forecasters what metrics they are watching closely right now. Many pointed to seven key indicators that have done a decent job signaling recessions in the past: manufacturing purchases (PMI), trucking volumes, heavy truck sales, business capital spending, temporary hires, bank lending conditions (i.e., how easy it is to get a loan) and new claims for unemployment benefits.\n\nThe data reveal a cloudy outlook but only a few signs of a nasty storm. Manufacturing is the biggest red flag, a sector that makes up about 12 percent of the economy. Trucking shipments and business spending are flashing some yellow lights, a reflection that executives are on edge. But hiring and banking lending still look solid — or even strong.\n\n“The message you hear from Fed Chair [Jerome H.] Powell and about everyone else is, ‘we are waiting for the trend to become clear,’ \" said Peter Atwater, president of Financial Insyghts. “The danger is everyone plays catch up at once” if the trend starts to point down.\n\n[Fed is prepared to act to save U.S. economy from trade war, Powell says]\n\nThe big risk is if corporate anxiety over the trade war, weak growth abroad and the slowing manufacturing sector causes businesses to halt hiring in the United States in coming months, a shift that would probably spook Main Street and cause the almighty American consumer to pull back on spending. But a lot remains unclear. Here’s a rundown of the key metrics.\n\nTrump: U.S. will continue to negotiate with China, won’t raise tariffs\n\n1. Manufacturing (red flag) — There has been a sharp deceleration in manufacturing in 2019. Hiring has flatlined after having one of its best years last year since the late 1990s. Output is slowing, and, especially alarming, manufacturing sentiment has tumbled to levels that almost signal a recession.\n\nMany economists closely watch the Purchasing Managers’ Index, a survey of industry leaders by IHS Markit. When PMI is above 50 the economy is usually expanding. When it falls below 50, the economy is typically contracting. In June, the index fell to 50.1, the worst reading since 2009. The question is whether this weakness will spill over into other sectors or set up a situation similar to that in 2015, when manufacturing contracted but the services sector (technology, finance, hospitality, health care, etc.) remained solid.\n\n[‘A constant state of drowning:’ On Post Reports, Heather Long talks to the Americans who don’t feel lifted by a strong economy]\n\n2. Trucking (yellow to red flag) — Nearly every good sold in the United States touches a truck at some point, which is why trucking shipment data can be revealing. After a stellar 2018, shipments have plunged during the past six months, according to the Cass Freight Index.\n\n“Bottom line, more and more data is indicating that this is the beginning of an economic contraction. If a contraction occurs, then the Cass Shipments Index will have been one of the first early indicators once again,” said Donald Broughton, founder of Broughton Capital and the lead analyst for the Cass Freight Index.\n\nBut many truckers note that it would be tough to continue last year’s levels, so it’s hard to know how much to read into the annual decline. In 2018, companies were enjoying big tax cuts that spurred some extra purchases and trying to move goods before Trump’s tariffs took effect.\n\n3. Heavy truck sales (green light) — While trucking shipments look gloomy, another way to gauge the health of the trucking industry (and overall economy) is to look at sales of the big 18-wheeler trucks. That data looks a lot better, a seeming indication that the industry is still in a good enough place for companies to want to invest for the future.\n\n“So far, the data I am looking at does not suggest the economy is slowing,” said Brian Wesbury, chief economist at First Trust Portfolios, who likes to watch large truck sales and initial jobless claims.\n\nBut Boris Strbac, owner of Star Trucking in Milwaukee, says a lot of trucking company owners wanted to buy trucks at the end of last year and couldn’t get them until this year because of heavy demand. He expects sales to drop off. “I made a mistake. I bought four trucks not too long ago. I regret that now, believe me,” he said.\n\n4. Jobless claims (green light) — Hiring has been one of the strongest parts of the economy since 2014. Economists closely watch how many Americans file for unemployment insurance, because that data comes out weekly and is often the first indication of trouble.\n\nNew jobless claims remain low, but there has been a slight uptick recently, reaching a seven-week high on Thursday. Still, most economists say unemployment claims need to reach at least 250,000 a week before there’s concern (the latest data out Thursday showed 227,000 new claims last week).\n\n5. Temporary hires (green light) — Another way to gauge how eager companies are to hire people is to look at how many temporary employees they bring on. These workers are usually the first to go if there’s any sign of a slowdown, since they are easy to let go and have few ties to the company or management.\n\nThe Labor Department measures temporary hires monthly. So far in 2019, temporary hiring has slowed, compared with last year’s, but it has yet to turn negative. Temp hiring appears to be consistent with the idea that the economy is slowing gradually this year but not nose-diving.\n\n6. Business spending (yellow flag) — Business leaders are nervous, according to most metrics of sentiment in the corporate sector. But the question is how is that translating into decision-making? This year evidence is growing that companies are pulling back on investment spending.\n\nBusiness typically taper their capital spending when they are less certain about the future, making it a closely watched economic gauge. Like temporary hires, business spending has yet to turn negative but it is showing a clear slowing path.\n\n7. Bank lending (green light) — While many watch the daily gyrations of the stock market, a better gauge of how Wall Street and the broader economy are interacting is what’s happening with bank loans. Economists pay close attention to whether banks are tightening lending standards, a sign of growing concern, or easing them.\n\nLately, banks have been easing lending standards, an indication that most banks don’t think a big downturn is imminent.\n\nMatthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, says all of these mixed signs about the economy lead him to predict “a decline in domestic growth momentum in the second half of the year,” but he is careful not to say “recession.”",

        "text": "A cargo ship prepares to dock June 10 at PortMiami in Miami Beach, which saw China as its top trading country in 2018, as trade tension continues between Washington and Beijing. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on virtually all products from China is running into a wall of opposition from the business community, amid fears that what began as a temporary negotiating tool is becoming a permanent feature of trans-Pacific trade.\n\nStarting Monday, hundreds of companies are scheduled to testify before the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) over seven days of hearings on the president’s proposal to expand tariffs to an additional $300 billion in imports from China. After a year-long trade war, those are the only imports from China that remain duty-free.\n\nThe USTR has received more than 1,600 written comments on the plan, with the overwhelming majority warning that additional tariffs would raise prices for consumers, cost American jobs and disrupt production at companies across the nation.\n\n“If we are forced to move production from China, it will take a long time to make sure that new factories will make the garment correctly and can get the proper materials. The costs may be too great too, as we are barely profitable now,” wrote Mark Corrado, president of Leading Lady, a bra maker in Beachwood, Ohio, who was among the first witnesses.\n\nThe avalanche of complaints suggests that industry patience with the president’s tariff-heavy trade policy is evaporating. His sudden threat last month to impose tariffs on Mexican imports in a dispute over border security, coupled with fading prospects for a comprehensive trade deal with China, explains the increasingly vocal opposition, according to trade analysts and executives.\n\n“The tone has changed since the Mexican tariff episode,” said Edward Alden, an economics professor at Western Washington University. “The level of concern in business is going up, and the willingness to challenge the president more directly on this issue is increasing.”\n\nSenate Republicans, including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, are considering legislation tohat would limit the president’s ability to impose tariffs.\n\nTrump began imposing import taxes on more than $250 billion in Chinese goods a year ago to compel China to treat American companies fairly, particularly by respecting their intellectual property rights.\n\nAs the confrontation with China intensified, many industry groups swallowed their tariff concerns in hopes that the president would succeed in forcing Beijing to change its practices. Until early May, that seemed a good bet, as Trump repeatedly said a historic trade deal with China was imminent.\n\nBut talks abruptly stalled six weeks ago, after the president’s chief trade negotiator, Robert E. Lighthizer, accused China of reneging on a tentative deal. Trump has said he wants to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of this month at the Group of 20 summit in Japan to revive discussions, but no meeting has been scheduled.\n\nIn Paris on Monday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross played down prospects for an early accord. “We will eventually make a deal, but if we don’t, the president is perfectly happy with continuing the tariff movements that we’ve already announced, as well as imposing the new ones that he has temporarily suspended,” Ross told CNBC.\n\nThe deadlock increases the likelihood that Trump will proceed with additional tariffs.\n\n“A substantial, enforceable and sustainable agreement could really help both sides. Further tariffs could really hurt both sides,” emailed Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. “Let’s hope that the two governments can get back to the table as soon as possible.”\n\nIf the president does follow through with his threat, he will be risking not only a clash with business groups but also consumer unease as he begins his reelection campaign. The initial tariffs on Chinese products were calibrated to minimize pain for American shoppers. Taxing almost all of the $540 billion in Chinese goods that the U.S. imports each year makes such pain difficult to avoid.\n\n“Companies have tried to shield customers from tariff increases, but that will no longer be possible,” said John Veroneau, a partner at Covington & Burling and a U.S. trade negotiator under President George W. Bush. “To the extent possible, companies are working hard to diversify supply chains, but it’s easier said than done.”\n\nLarry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said Thursday that the tariffs’ impact on American consumers would be “very, very small” and that any costs would be worth bearing if they secured a rebalancing of the U.S.-China trade relationship.\n\nBut that same day, 661 companies — including retail giants Costco and Walmart — wrote the administration warning that the tariffs would destroy 2 million U.S. jobs and cost the average family $2,000 each year.\n\n“We know firsthand that the additional tariffs will have a significant, negative and long-term impact on American businesses, farmers, families and the U.S. economy,” the companies said. “Broadly applied tariffs are not an effective tool to change China’s unfair trade practices. Tariffs are taxes paid directly by U.S. companies, including those listed below — not China.”\n\nThe new levies will hit laptop computers and tablets, cellphones, smartwatches, computer displays, televisions and gaming consoles, Nathaniel Bolin, an attorney representing Best Buy, told USTR in written comments.\n\nThe company iRobot said it raised prices on its Roomba vacuum cleaner at the beginning of this year because of earlier Trump tariffs. Additional import levies will lead to higher prices on its new robotic mops and lawn mowers, delaying their adoption by consumers and “preventing us from hiring more well-paid, high-skilled American workers,” wrote Glen Weinstein, iRobot’s chief legal officer.\n\nThe president says that companies can evade the tariffs by moving production from China to countries such as Vietnam or the United States. Based in Bedford, Mass., iRobot, which has switched some of its orders to factories outside China, told the USTR it “will not be able to entirely relocate our manufacturing and supply chain in the short to medium term.”\n\nGraco, which makes car seats, strollers and high chairs, says that by raising prices, the tariffs will encourage consumers to buy used products that may not be safe. Products bought on the secondhand market could be subject to government-ordered recall without a consumer’s knowledge or might lack the most up-to-date safety features, warned Russell Torres, group vice president of Newell Brands, Graco’s corporate parent.\n\nThe tariffs could have a wider impact on overall U.S. trade, according to SSA Marine, which operates terminals at major ports including Long Beach, Calif.; Seattle; and Savannah, Ga.\n\nThe company told the USTR that it is “totally dependent” upon China to supply the 160-foot-tall cranes that lift shipping containers from cargo vessels to the pier. Without the newest models, some American ports would be unable to handle the largest vessels.\n\n“This puts U.S. exporters and importers at a distinct disadvantage in global markets,” Ed De­Nike, who heads SSA’s domestic container operations, wrote to the USTR.\n\nIn previous tariff rounds, the administration allowed companies to seek waivers permitting them to continue importing specific products if there was no alternative to a Chinese supplier. A similar process is likely if additional tariffs are imposed, though executives have complained about the red tape, uncertainty and delays involved in obtaining those exemptions.\n\nSome trade analysts are skeptical that administration officials will heed the warnings that will be aired at this week’s hearings.\n\nRiley Waters of the Heritage Foundation tweeted: “7 days, 321 witnesses, $300 billion worth of goods, and a waste of everyone’s time. Witnesses’ testimonies will fall on deaf ears as @realDonald­Trump had made it clear it’s his decision that matters. For Americans, the cost of these and previous tariffs will be real.”",

        "text": "\n\nDonald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House. (Al Drago/Bloomberg).\n\nThe U.S. economy grew 2.2 percent in the final quarter of last year, the Commerce Department said Thursday, less than the 2.6 percent the government initially estimated and another sign of a slowdown.\n\nPresident Trump, however, has focused on how fast the economy grew in 2018, which was widely expected to be a strong year after the GOP tax cuts and infusion of more government spending. Trump contends the economy is taking off, while most economists say growth peaked last year.\n\nTrump has been touting 3.1 percent economic growth in 2018. But officially, the Commerce Department said Thursday, the economy grew 2.9 percent last year.\n\nThere are two main ways to calculate GDP growth. The White House method is to calculate the change from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018, which is preferred by many economists, including the Federal Reserve. The Commerce Department reported Friday that measure of growth was revised down to 3 percent.\n\nThe official government GDP statistic, however, is calculated by comparing how many goods and services were produced in 2017 ($18.6 trillion) with 2017 output ($18.1 trillion). That change is 2.9 percent.\n\nThe two measures are typically quite close, and few people beyond data nerds notice the difference. But this report came under more scrutiny because Trump promised 3 percent growth every year for the next decade. Americans are rightly asking: Did he achieve his goal?\n\n[Trump won’t get sustained ‘boom’ without an infrastructure bill and more tax cuts, new White House report shows]\n\nBy the official government statistic, Trump did not. But most economists are willing to say he did because they think it is valid to look at the 3 percent calculation.\n\nWhat is perhaps more important is putting growth in historical context. The 2.9 percent measure is the best since 2015, a robust but not unprecedented rate during this recovery.\n\nTrump has been pointing to the 3 percent measure as the “best in 14 years.” He says that because it is the best fourth quarter to fourth quarter change during that time frame, but growth also hit 3 percent (or better) several times under President Obama, including during the first quarter of 2015, when it grew 3.8 percent.\n\nEconomists are not focused on this political debate. The main takeaway for most experts is that growth is showing clear signs of slowing. The economy grew 4.2 percent in the second quarter of 2018, 3.4 percent in the third quarter and a 2.2 percent in the final quarter.\n\nBoth consumers and businesses cooled in the final quarter of the year and that trend is expected to continue in early 2019.\n\nThe White House is predicting 3.2 percent growth this year, but most independent forecasters expect it to fall within the 2 to 2.5 percent range. The first quarter is expected to be particularly sluggish because of bad weather in parts of the country and the partial government shutdown.\n\n“In 2018, momentum accelerated. In 2019, we will see momentum decelerating. The inflection point was really the fourth quarter last year,” said Gregory Daco, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “This does not mean we’re headed for a recession. It just means growth will slow to about 2 percent this year and next.”\n\nRelated:\n\nTrump won’t get sustained ‘boom’ without an infrastructure bill and more tax cuts\n\nTrump picks close ally Stephen Moore for Fed seat as economy shows signs of weakness",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output was unchanged in March after two straight monthly declines, resulting in the first quarterly drop in production since President Donald Trump was elected.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A line worker installs the front seats on the flex line at Nissan Motor Co's automobile manufacturing plant in Smyrna, Tennessee, U.S., August 23, 2018. REUTERS/William DeShazer/File Photo\n\nThe weakness in manufacturing reported by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday is in tandem with a moderation in the broader economy, and is despite the White House’s “America First” policies, including trade tariffs aimed at protecting domestic factories from what Trump says in unfair foreign competition.\n\nSoft manufacturing and slowing economic growth reflect the ebbing stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package and supply chain disruptions caused by Washington’s trade war with China.\n\n“Manufacturing production has pivoted to the downside in the first quarter of the year, showing the revival in factories and output is sputtering for the first time since the Trump economics team took office,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “The trade war and America First policies have not brought factories back home yet.”\n\nManufacturing output last month was restrained by weak motor vehicle and wood products production after falling 0.3 percent in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing production edging up 0.1 percent in March.\n\nProduction at factories dropped at a 1.1 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. That was the first quarterly drop since the third quarter of 2017 and followed a 1.7 percent pace of increase in the October-December period.\n\nU.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.\n\nMotor vehicles and parts production dropped 2.5 percent in March after increasing 2.3 percent in February. An inventory overhang in the automobile sector is weighing on production.\n\nFactory employment declined in March for the first time since July 2017. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output rose 0.2 percent in March, lifted by increases in the production of primary metals, and computer and electronic products, after falling 0.5 percent in February.\n\nUNDERWHELMING RECOVERY EVIDENCE\n\nWhile that offered some glimmers of hope for manufacturing, the outlook for the sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, is cloudy. A survey from the New York Fed on Monday showed a measure of future business activity in New York state dropped to a more than three-year low in April, with companies downbeat about new orders and shipments.\n\n“We think we could be moving past the worst of the recent soft patch for the manufacturing sector, although the evidence of this improvement has not been overwhelmingly clear,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.\n\nManufacturing is also being hobbled by last year’s surge in the dollar and softening global economic growth, which are hurting exports. The sector could be further strained by Boeing’s decision to stop deliveries and cut back production of its troubled 737 MAX aircraft. The MAX planes have been grounded indefinitely following two deadly crashes.\n\n“The delivery stoppage and production slowdown of the 737 MAX will be a drag on production and orders data in the near term, and may subtract as much as two tenths of a percentage point from second-quarter GDP growth,” said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte.\n\nWhile manufacturing is struggling, there are signs of green shoots in the housing market after activity contracted last year. A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Tuesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders edged up this month amid optimism over sales conditions and buyer traffic.\n\nThe housing market is getting a lift from a fall in mortgage rates after they surged last year. But housing accounts for a small fraction of the economy, meaning the recovery in activity is unlikely to have a huge impact on gross domestic product.\n\nGrowth forecasts for the first quarter are between a 1.5 percent and 2.3 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a moderate 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter after expanding at a brisk 3.4 percent pace in the July-September period.\n\nThe flat manufacturing output in March, together with a 0.8 percent drop in mining, led to a 0.1 percent dip in industrial production. Industrial output edged up 0.1 percent in February. It fell at a 0.3 percent rate in the first quarter after rising at a 4.0 percent pace in the fourth quarter.\n\nMining production was unchanged in February. Oil and gas well drilling rebounded 0.3 percent in March after tumbling 1.3 percent in February. Utilities output gained 0.2 percent in March after surging 3.7 percent the prior month.\n\nCapacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, slipped to 76.4 percent last month, the lowest in a year, from 76.5 percent in February. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector fell to 78.8 percent from 79.0 percent in February.\n\nIt is 1.0 percentage point below its 1972-2017 average. Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much “slack” remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.",

        "text": "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised concerns the economy is slowing and sent its strongest signal to date that it could act soon to cut interest rates, a move that would plunge the central bank into unusual territory.\n\nBusiness investment is slowing, uncertainty has increased and the U.S. economy is growing at a “moderate” pace, the Fed said Wednesday in its official policy statement, a notable downgrade from last month, when the central bank characterized the economy as “solid.”\n\nThe Fed did not cut rates Wednesday and did not specify exactly when it would. But nearly half of Fed leaders now predict rates will fall by the end of the year, a significant change from March, when none of the 17 Fed policymakers anticipated a cut this year. Seven of the 17 are forecasting two rate decreases by the end of 2019, according to projections also released Wednesday.\n\n“The case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,” Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said Wednesday. “It’s really trade developments and concerns about global growth that are on our minds. . . . Risks seem to have grown.\"\n\n[Trump’s potential Fed pick Judy Shelton wants to see ‘lower rates as fast as possible’]\n\nThe Fed’s benchmark interest rates play a powerful role in shaping the economy, by encouraging or discouraging the lending that often serves as the lifeblood of business. Mortgages, credit cards, business loans and virtually all other types of lending are affected by the Fed’s decisions.\n\nThe Fed is facing an unusual predicament. By many measures, the economy is doing well, with unemployment and inflation low, so it should not need stimulus from low rates. But there have been numerous red flags recently that the economy could turn, particularly in manufacturing data, and the Fed is in the uncomfortable spot of trying to figure out whether the head winds are strong enough to necessitate action.\n\nIt is also a difficult moment because so much of the economy’s path could be dictated by political events, including a meeting later this month between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping that could defuse trade tensions that have grown more intense this year.\n\n[Business Steel industry begins to idle plants, shows signs of weakness]\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has repeatedly slammed the Fed for not cutting rates, though Powell reaffirmed Wednesday he is not looking to respond to political criticism.\n\nStocks rallied modestly Wednesday after the Fed’s decision, probably because the Fed made clear it would act to prevent a downturn.\n\n“The Fed is getting awfully close to a rate cut,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “They promised that they have got the economy’s back.”\n\nPowell stressed repeatedly during his news conference Wednesday that businesses are growing more nervous about the trade war and that global growth is deteriorating. He also emphasized that inflation remains low and the Fed does not see any sign it will rise soon.\n\n“I think there will be one cut in July and one in September,” said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. “The news we’re getting from the rest of the world is not very encouraging. Europe is not performing well at all.”\n\nPowell specifically pointed to the weakening manufacturing sector as a concern and the disappointing May jobs report, which showed slowing in hiring in blue-collar and service-sector jobs. The Fed will see the June jobs report and get an initial look at second-quarter growth by the time it meets to decide whether to cut rates next month.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump suggested he might try to remove Powell from the top leadership post at the Fed if Powell does not lower rates soon. Powell, a Republican who was nominated by Trump for the job, has been a frequent target of the president’s ire, with the Fed raising interest rates four times last year.\n\nFed leaders are allowed to be removed only “for cause,” which has been interpreted by courts as criminal wrongdoing. Having a central bank that makes decisions independent of politics is widely viewed by Wall Street and business leaders as fundamental to a strong economy, but Trump is betting that lower interest rates could help the economy and boost his chances of reelection in 2020.\n\nPowell reiterated that he does not believe he can be fired and does not intend to step down.\n\n“I think the law is clear that I have a four-year term, and I fully intend to serve it,” Powell said. “My colleagues and I have one overarching goal, to sustain the economic expansion with a strong market and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.”\n\n[There are 3 ways the U.S.-China trade war could end]\n\nWhile Wall Street and Trump are likely to welcome a cut, some economists say the Fed is going too far before there are genuine signs of concern. The U.S. economy is powered by consumer spending, which has been strong this spring, and there is reason to believe business sentiment could rebound quickly if U.S.-China trade tensions subside.\n\n“I fear that the Fed has raised expectations of a July rate cut to the point where it will find it hard to avoid when the time comes, even if conditions don’t really call for it,” said George Selgin, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\nPowell has been clear that he will do whatever it takes to keep the economy thriving for as long as possible, but he noted that the reason the committee did not act Wednesday was that it was not yet clear that the trade tensions were having a deep impact.\n\n“Some of these developments are so recent that we want to see whether they are sustained,” Powell said.\n\nInterest rates are near 2.5 percent, the highest level in more than a decade but low by historical standards. The Fed wants to act quickly to head off trouble in the economy, but there is also a risk that the central bank could cut rates too soon and then would not have many tools left to fight a larger hit to the economy down the road.\n\nWhile Trump has called for a rate cut, an action typically used to stimulate a slowing economy, the president also calls this the greatest economy ever.\n\n“Our economy has never, ever been stronger than it is today,” Trump said Wednesday at a ceremony at the White House to honor conservative economist Arthur Laffer, who helped shape tax-cut plans for Trump and President Ronald Reagan.\n\nPowell call the outlook for the economy “complicated” right now, but he noted that working-class people are finally benefiting from the recovery — which next month will become the longest in U.S. history — and that he wants to keep that going, a goal he shares with Trump.\n\n“You’ve got workers in surveys saying that jobs are plentiful. You’ve got wages going up. You’ve got high levels of household confidence,” Powell said. “Wages are rising, and this is particularly so for lower-paying jobs.”\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump’s potential Fed pick Judy Shelton wants to see ‘lower rates as fast as possible’\n\nTrump suggests he might remove Powell\n\nTrump may be about to face his biggest test yet on the economy",

        "text": "THE TICKER\n\nTrader Joseph Lawler works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)\n\nArguably one of the worst things that could happen to the stock market just did: It closed at a record high.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.9 percent to close at 2954.18, its first new high since April, while the Dow Jones industrial average surged a similar amount to come within 0.3 percent of its all-time high. Stocks appeared to be rallying on news out of this week’s Fed meeting that the central bank is primed to cut interest rates to protect an economic expansion menaced by, among other things, President Trump’s trade war.\n\nBut a surging market and a newly dovish Fed might be unwittingly conspiring to intensify Trump’s trade confrontation with China. That’s because, armed with the confidence that stocks are rising and the Fed is moving his way, the president will feel less pressure to negotiate a cease-fire when he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, next week.\n\nTrump on Thursday made clear via his Twitter account that he is keeping a close eye on the market’s action:\n\nS&P closes at Record High! https://t.co/C5nOXIQ7EJ — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 20, 2019\n\nAnd he took a victory lap of sorts over the news the Fed looks ready to cut its benchmark interest rate later this year, saying he was encouraged by what he saw. “They should have done it sooner, but what are you going to do?” he told reporters Thursday.\n\nThe twin developments spell bad news for investors, business interests and others rooting for the administration to settle its trade hostilities with Beijing — or at least put them on pause before imposing 25 percent tariffs on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese imports, which Trump has threatened barring major concessions from Xi.\n\n“Both Trump and Xi feel they’re in the stronger position, which doesn’t usually get you to a deal,” says Bill Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Trump believes he’s in an economically stronger position at home, and we’re hurting them more than they’re hurting us. Xi knows he doesn’t have to have an election, and we do. And he probably thinks Trump needs a victory on trade, because he doesn’t have many, despite making it a signature issue, and probably feels Trump will not go to the next tranche of tariffs because of the terrible consumer impact it would have.”\n\nOther trade watchers are similarly bearish about prospects for a breakthrough in Japan. “Both presidents are under pressure to get a deal, but both are under pressure to get a good deal,” Doug Barry of the U.S.-China Business Council writes in an email. “So at this point we have building pressure but no clarity on when and how it will be released.”\n\nOr as Bloomberg Economics chief economist Tom Orlik writes, after noting the market and Fed moves reduce pressure on Trump to make a deal, “At the same time, the incentives for Trump, who officially launched his reelection bid this week, to stand tough on China are rising. The lesson of past presidential elections is that bashing Beijing is a vote-winning strategy with few downsides, politically speaking. By contrast, the concessions required to get a deal done would open up Trump to criticism that he’d gone soft at the last minute.”\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizerspeak with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He in Washington last month. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nAnd at least one White House adviser on China issues said a tariff escalation may be necessary. Michael Pillsbury, a Hudson Institute senior fellow who consults with the administration, gave even odds to the two sides agreeing to restart talks next week. But in a Monday appearance on Fox Business, he said, “I’m afraid the president may need to go to the full 25 percent on all Chinese exports to America, because they just seem to feel the pain in China in a subjective sense. They should. But they just don’t see it that way.”\n\nInvestors evidently appraise the situation differently.\n\n“Trade tensions and uncertainty over central-bank policy had rattled investors last month, with stocks posting their worst May since 2010,” The Wall Street Journal’s Jessica Menton writes. \"But the potential for thawing trade relations between Washington and Beijing has helped lift share prices this month, putting the S&P 500 on pace for its best June since 1955.”\n\nOr as Jonathan Corpina of Meridian Equity Partners told her, “Investors are now really banking on the G-20 summit.”\n\nMARKET MOVERS\n\nRobots work on a VW Passat car at a Volkswagen plant in Emden, Germany. (Joerg Sarbach/dpa via AP)\n\n— Stumbling factory output highlights global slowdown. WSJ's Paul Hannon: \"Factory output is faltering in a number of key economies, darkening the outlook for the global economy and increasing the likelihood that leading central banks will respond with fresh stimulus. Global industrial production has been weakening since the start of 2018, around the same time that [Trump] announced the first in a series of fresh tariffs on imports from a number of countries, including China. Europe has suffered the sharpest turnaround, and there is little relief in sight, according to a June survey of purchasing managers conducted by data firm IHS Markit that was released Friday...\n\n\"Economists are divided on whether the factory slowdown is largely a consequence of disruptions to trade and investment as a result of higher tariffs and uncertainty about where they will settle, or a more short-lived pause after a long expansion and some setbacks in particular sectors, such as automobiles.\"\n\n— Gold surges. Bloomberg's Ranjeetha Pakiam: \"Gold’s firmly back in favor. Prices have taken off after a lackluster few months, passing $1,400 an ounce for the first time since September 2013 on Friday. Investors have piled back into exchange-traded funds and the U.S. Federal Reserve gave bulls a major boost this week when it opened the door to reducing interest rates, weakening the dollar and adding to gold’s appeal.\n\n\"Central banks in Europe and Australia have added to the positive narrative, signaling they’re also ready to do more for economic growth. And gold’s traditional role as a haven asset has provided further impetus amid increased tensions between the U.S. and Iran following the downing of an American drone.\"\n\nTRUMP TRACKER\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\nPeople walk past an Apple store at an outdoor shopping street in Beijing. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\n— Chinese companies go on K Street hiring spree. Politico's Theodoric Meyer: \"Trump has done everything he can to squeeze Huawei over the past year, bringing criminal charges against the Chinese telecommunications company, moving to block it from buying American technology and trying to convince foreign governments to crack down on the company. Now other Chinese companies are turning to K Street to keep the same thing from happening to them.\n\n\"Eight other Chinese companies have spent at least $7.9 million hiring Washington lobbying and public relations firms since last spring, right before Trump cracked down on a different Chinese telecom company, ZTE, according to a POLITICO analysis of disclosure filings. That’s nearly eight times what the same companies spent in the same period a year earlier.\"\n\n— Apple eyes moving some production out of China. WSJ's Yoko Kubota and Tripp Mickle: \"Apple Inc. is asking suppliers to study shifting final assembly of some products out of China, people familiar with the matter said, as trade tensions prompt the company to consider diversifying its supply chain. While any major changes would be difficult and could take months to years to implement, Apple is looking into the feasibility of shifting up to about a third of the production for some devices, some of the people said. Destinations under consideration include Southeast Asia, the people said.\"\n\nThe company is also pressing the Trump administration for tariff relief. FT's Tim Bradshaw: \"Apple has warned the Trump administration that proposed tariffs on imports of iPhones made in China would 'tilt the playing field' in favour of the company’s overseas rivals and dent its multibillion-dollar contribution to the US economy... In a letter that was made public on Thursday, Apple pressed the White House to abandon tariffs of up to 25 per cent on its products including iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches , as well as parts used in device repairs. The extra duty, if passed on to consumers, could add hundreds of dollars to the cost of Apple’s high-end products.\"\n\nMore broadly, the trade war already looks to be severing the tech linkage between the U.S. and China, as these charts demonstrate, via Ely Ratner of the Center for a New American Security:\n\nStriking data.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\n— Trump's challenge: Voters who are satisfied with the economy but not him. The Atlantic's Ron Brownstein identifies what he calls the biggest obstacle to Trump's reelection: \"His polarizing approach to the presidency is alienating an unusually large number of voters satisfied with the economy... Trump attracts much less support than his predecessors did—in terms of approval rating and potential support for reelection—among voters who say they are satisfied with the economy.\n\n\"Long-term comparisons from the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll quantify the shortfall. In a 2006 survey, then-President George W. Bush drew positive job-approval ratings from 71 percent of Americans who said they were satisfied with the economy... Likewise, in 2013 and 2015, just over 75 percent of economically satisfied voters said they approved of Barack Obama’s performance as president... But in an NBC/WSJ poll last September, only 55 percent of voters in that category said they approved of Trump’s performance.\"\n\nPolitics When Trump visits his clubs, government agencies and Republicans pay to be where he is Trump’s trips have brought his businesses at least $1.6 million in revenue, according to a Washington Post analysis.

(Christopher Goodney/Bloomberg)\n\n— BofA chief: No recession looming. CNN Business's Matt Egan: \"The soft patch in the US economy is unlikely to morph into a full-blown recession, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan told CNN Business. 'The economy was predicted by everybody to slow down ... That's coming true,' Moynihan said in an exclusive interview from the sidelines of the Fortune Brainstorm Finance Conference in Montauk, New York. 'The reality is we feel good about the economy.' The Bank of America CEO's optimism is based on his bank's view into consumer spending — the central driver of the American economy.\"\n\n— Facebook assembles rapid response team to avoid contributing to another genocide. NBC's David Ingram: \"The driving force behind the team is the company’s blotted legacy in Myanmar, the southeast Asian nation where, according to United Nations researchers, Facebook became the go-to tool for spreading propaganda that helped drive a genocide of a religious minority, the Rohingya, that is estimated to have killed more than 10,000 people since the beginning of 2017.\n\n\"Called Strategic Response, the team is a mix of the kind of people who have typically been found in either governments or multinational corporations with far-reaching interests. The team’s formation, which started in spring of last year and recently ramped up hiring, represents the latest evolution in the Silicon Valley’s culture: less 'move fast and break things,' and more thinking through the harm they are adding to half a world away.\"\n\nU.S. Companies Brought Home More Profits From Overseas U.S. companies brought home more profits stashed overseas in 2018, the first year after the tax-law overhaul, than initially estimated.

NYT\n\nMONEY ON THE HILL\n\nHouse Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\n— Waters: Congress will aggressively examine Facebook currency. CNBC's Kate Rooney: \"Top lawmakers are not hesitating to examine Facebook’s ambitious new cryptocurrency project. 'We’re going to move aggressively and very quickly to deal with what is going on with this new cryptocurrency,' Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, told CNBC’s 'Closing Bell' Thursday. 'I think it’s very important for them to stop right now what they’re doing so that we can get a handle on this.' ... In a statement Tuesday, Waters asked Facebook to delay the project, which she said was a continuation of its “unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.”\n\n— Pelosi: Mulvaney has no cred in debt ceiling debate. The Post's Colby Itkowitz and Damian Paletta: \"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney of misrepresenting her position on the debt ceiling, illustrating the lack of trust between key policymakers over an issue that could imperil the global economy later this year.\n\n\"Mulvaney said that during a meeting Wednesday between congressional leaders and White House staff, Pelosi (D-Calif.) had insisted that she would increase the debt ceiling only if the Trump administration agreed to boost spending levels. Asked to respond to this, Pelosi said Mulvaney had 'no credibility' on the debt ceiling after his role in the 2011 and 2013 budget fights and had misrepresented her remarks.\"\n\nTHE REGULATORS\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau headquarters in Washington. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\n— Trump appointee who wrote racist posts joins HUD. The Post's Renae Merle: \"Eric Blankenstein, a senior Trump appointee, announced he was leaving the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last month after he was forced to apologize for online posts he wrote years ago questioning whether the n-word was racist. But Blankenstein won’t be leaving the Trump administration altogether. The former private-sector lawyer is joining the Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to a person familiar with the matter. The news was first reported by Politico. Blankenstein will join HUD’s Office of General Counsel as a senior counsel starting Monday, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.\"\n\n— Walmart settles bribery case with the feds. NYT's Michael Corkery: \"For more than a decade, Walmart used middlemen to make dubious payments to governments around the globe in order to open new locations, United States prosecutors and securities regulators said in a settlement agreement on Thursday. But even as employees frequently raised alarm, the company’s top leaders did little to prevent Walmart from being involved in bribery and corruption schemes.\n\n\"That lack of internal control led to a seven-year inquiry that culminated on Thursday with Walmart’s Brazilian subsidiary pleading guilty to a federal crime. The guilty plea, and the $282 million in fines that Walmart has agreed to pay, capped one of the biggest investigations ever under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it illegal for American corporations to bribe overseas officials.\"\n\nTHE FUNNIES\n\nFrom The Post's Tom Toles:\n\nBULL SESSION",

        "text": "Traders and financial professionals work at the opening bell on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange this month. The stock market has rebounded in recent weeks. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump faces a number of major decisions on trade and the budget in the coming months just as the U.S. economy faces the biggest head winds of his tenure, forcing him to decide whether to recalibrate as recession fears mount for next year.\n\nTrump has threatened to escalate trade conflicts with China, Mexico, the European Union and Japan, spooking business leaders and leading some to pull back investment. Similarly, budget and debt-ceiling talks with congressional leaders from both parties have sputtered, raising the possibility of another government shutdown in October.\n\nThe uncertainty — and a cooling global economy — led JPMorgan Chase on Monday to predict that there was a 45 percent chance the U.S. economy would enter a recession in the next year, up from 20 percent at the beginning of 2018.\n\nAlso Monday, a key gauge of New York’s manufacturing industry notched the biggest one-month drop ever recorded. It was the latest sign that after a relatively strong economy last year, political and economic forces appear to have combined this year in a way that has darkened the economic outlook. This could be problematic for Trump, who has tried to tout the economy’s performance as key to his reelection.\n\n“The key question is: Can you have a smooth landing for the economy?” said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist for Mellon and a former Federal Reserve economist. “We’re going through a slowdown and nobody likes it. It doesn’t feel good.”\n\nThe economy’s softening and uncertainty around Trump’s next actions are causing a delicate situation for the Fed, which is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. Trump is relying on the central bank to cut interest rates to boost economic growth. But Fed officials are trying to reconcile worrisome reports about the economy with other areas of relative strength, particularly the low unemployment rate and high levels of consumer spending.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has it within his power to reduce risks to the economy — on the budget and trade.\n\nLawmakers are working to craft a budget deal that could avoid a shutdown in the fall, raise the federal debt limit and prevent deep spending cuts. But so far even Republicans have struggled to come to an agreement with the White House, which would be a prelude to a broader negotiation with Democrats. Similar efforts at the beginning of the year ended in the longest government shutdown on record after Trump demanded funding for his border wall.\n\nAnother government shutdown, flirting with a breach of the federal debt limit and deep spending cuts would all hit the economy.\n\nSimilarly on trade, White House officials, Republican leaders and business executives have said that if the spats are resolved soon, that could lift the economy heading into 2020. But so far most of the negotiations are either unresolved or stalled, with uncertainty even over whether Trump will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 meeting next week.\n\n“The biggest self-inflicted risk to growth today would be trade going south,” JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon told reporters last week.\n\nThe president has taken complete ownership of the economy’s performance, calling it the “Trump economy.” During the first year of his presidency, his top economic advisers engaged in rigorous debate about how to shape policy, and Trump hesitated to take actions that would harm growth.\n\nBut over the past year, his team has become largely deferential to Trump’s instincts, particularly on trade, and Trump has been willing to entertain tariffs and government shutdowns in hopes of achieving other policy objectives even if they posed risks to the economy.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump discounted the concerns and said the economy’s performance was historic and just getting started. He warned of a downturn if he loses next year. He often refers to the economy setting records but rarely specifies to which records he is referring.\n\n“The Trump Economy is setting records, and has a long way up to go,” he wrote on Twitter. “However, if anyone but me takes over in 2020 (I know the competition very well), there will be a Market Crash the likes of which has not been seen before! KEEP AMERICA GREAT.”\n\nNext month the economy will notch the longest expansion in U.S. history, growing for more than a decade since the Great Recession officially ended in 2009. Trump boosted growth with tax cuts, higher levels of government spending and more deregulation, but Democrats have charged that some of these changes amounted to a “sugar high” that will wear off and ultimately damage the economy.\n\nThere are numerous signs that the economy’s strength last year might prove short-lived.\n\nManufacturing indexes have fallen to the lowest levels of Trump’s presidency, reflecting weaker demand and fears that Trump’s adversarial approach to trade is leading companies at home and abroad to pull back on spending.\n\nAmid signs that some manufacturers are pulling back, Trump has gone on the attack. He has lashed out at several iconic companies, including Harley-Davidson and General Motors, over announcements of cutting domestic jobs, and he said last week he was pushing Lockheed Martin not to curb production at a helicopter plant in Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump has tried to point to individual companies that he sees are cutting jobs, but the impact of these threats is unclear. Businesses cut back on capital investment in the first three months of the year even though they continued to benefit from sweeping tax cuts at the end of 2017.\n\nThe Morgan Stanley Business Conditions Index recorded its largest one-month drop on record in June and is now at its lowest level since December 2008, when the U.S. economy was in the middle of a recession.\n\n“We see this underlying deterioration. It’s been a slow bleed,” said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income. Piegza has been especially alarmed by slowing private domestic sales, an indication that U.S. demand is likely weakening.\n\nAnalysts and White House officials, however, have stressed that there are still numerous bright spots in the economy and have cautioned against overreacting to a few blips in the data.\n\n“Trump has deeply held convictions on trade. A few short-term data points aren’t going to change his mind,” said one senior official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nAbout 70 percent of the U.S. economy is driven by consumer spending and consumer confidence remains strong, with retail spending jumping in April and May. Inflation remains low, and wages have been growing fastest for working-class Americans.\n\nThe U.S. economy added just 75,000 jobs in May, many fewer than expected, but the unemployment rate is 3.6 percent. White House officials believe wages and consumer spending will help lift the economy despite other factors even if businesses continue to pull back investing.\n\n“In the end, you have to judge whether the data are making sense,” Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview. “The thing that makes sense to me is we get saved from the slowdown by the consumer right now because income growth has been so high.”\n\nTrump and business leaders are both looking to the Fed for a possible lift. The stock market has rebounded in recent weeks, largely based on investor belief that the Fed will step in to counter any widespread harm from the tariffs.\n\nWall Street is forecasting an 85 percent chance of a rate cut in July and will be watching Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell’s news conference closely Wednesday for signs he is ready to act soon.\n\n“The Fed is going to try to act sooner rather than later. If they wait too long, it will be much more difficult to get out of trouble,” said Andrew Levin, a former Fed economist who now teaches at Dartmouth.\n\nThe biggest concern, however, remains how Trump plans to resolve the escalating trade fight with China. Trump has imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports and threatened to penalize an additional $300 billion in imports if China doesn’t agree to major concessions. Talks with China began last year and continued for months before unraveling in May. Trump has said that if Xi doesn’t meet with him next week during the G-20 summit in Japan, the United States would be prepared to move forward with new tariffs.\n\n“The economy is not close to a recession this year, but next year is a lot more problematic,” said Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments who writes a daily political newsletter. “If we go into 2020 with no China deal, that’s going to be a significant negative for him in terms of business uncertainty, farmer uncertainty, weaker economic growth and maybe even a little touch of inflation.”\n\nMore than 320 companies and industry groups are testifying at the United States Trade Representative’s office this week and next about their fears that imposing tariffs on all Chinese imports will cause significant price increase, job losses and profits to shrink. But inside the White House, some advisers point out that hundreds of thousands of companies were not bothered enough to testify or even submit comments about the tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. economy grew 2.9 percent in 2018, the highest level since 2015, according to the Commerce Department. White House officials have predicted growth will be even stronger this year, but few others concur. The economy grew 3.1 percent in the first three months, but a number of analysts predict it will grow less than 2 percent between April 1 and the end of September.\n\nTrump has shown no sides of backing down, particularly in his trade fight with China or in his budget impasse with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. But he has also shown a penchant for pivoting sharply when confronted by bad polls or a stock market dip, numbers that he watches closely.\n\n“The White House doesn’t need to panic, but there are reasons to be nervous,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist who advised Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) during his 2008 presidential run. “We were always going to slow down from 3 percent growth. The question is, to what? If we slow down to 2.5 percent, that’s a huge victory. If we slow down to 1.5 percent, that’s a much tougher reelection sell.”",

        "text": "Traders and financial professionals work at the opening bell on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange this month. The stock market has rebounded in recent weeks. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump faces a number of major decisions on trade and the budget in the coming months just as the U.S. economy faces the biggest head winds of his tenure, forcing him to decide whether to recalibrate as recession fears mount for next year.\n\nTrump has threatened to escalate trade conflicts with China, Mexico, the European Union and Japan, spooking business leaders and leading some to pull back investment. Similarly, budget and debt-ceiling talks with congressional leaders from both parties have sputtered, raising the possibility of another government shutdown in October.\n\nThe uncertainty — and a cooling global economy — led JPMorgan Chase on Monday to predict that there was a 45 percent chance the U.S. economy would enter a recession in the next year, up from 20 percent at the beginning of 2018.\n\nAlso Monday, a key gauge of New York’s manufacturing industry notched the biggest one-month drop ever recorded. It was the latest sign that after a relatively strong economy last year, political and economic forces appear to have combined this year in a way that has darkened the economic outlook. This could be problematic for Trump, who has tried to tout the economy’s performance as key to his reelection.\n\n“The key question is: Can you have a smooth landing for the economy?” said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist for Mellon and a former Federal Reserve economist. “We’re going through a slowdown and nobody likes it. It doesn’t feel good.”\n\nThe economy’s softening and uncertainty around Trump’s next actions are causing a delicate situation for the Fed, which is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. Trump is relying on the central bank to cut interest rates to boost economic growth. But Fed officials are trying to reconcile worrisome reports about the economy with other areas of relative strength, particularly the low unemployment rate and high levels of consumer spending.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has it within his power to reduce risks to the economy — on the budget and trade.\n\nLawmakers are working to craft a budget deal that could avoid a shutdown in the fall, raise the federal debt limit and prevent deep spending cuts. But so far even Republicans have struggled to come to an agreement with the White House, which would be a prelude to a broader negotiation with Democrats. Similar efforts at the beginning of the year ended in the longest government shutdown on record after Trump demanded funding for his border wall.\n\nAnother government shutdown, flirting with a breach of the federal debt limit and deep spending cuts would all hit the economy.\n\nSimilarly on trade, White House officials, Republican leaders and business executives have said that if the spats are resolved soon, that could lift the economy heading into 2020. But so far most of the negotiations are either unresolved or stalled, with uncertainty even over whether Trump will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 meeting next week.\n\n“The biggest self-inflicted risk to growth today would be trade going south,” JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon told reporters last week.\n\nThe president has taken complete ownership of the economy’s performance, calling it the “Trump economy.” During the first year of his presidency, his top economic advisers engaged in rigorous debate about how to shape policy, and Trump hesitated to take actions that would harm growth.\n\nBut over the past year, his team has become largely deferential to Trump’s instincts, particularly on trade, and Trump has been willing to entertain tariffs and government shutdowns in hopes of achieving other policy objectives even if they posed risks to the economy.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump discounted the concerns and said the economy’s performance was historic and just getting started. He warned of a downturn if he loses next year. He often refers to the economy setting records but rarely specifies to which records he is referring.\n\n“The Trump Economy is setting records, and has a long way up to go,” he wrote on Twitter. “However, if anyone but me takes over in 2020 (I know the competition very well), there will be a Market Crash the likes of which has not been seen before! KEEP AMERICA GREAT.”\n\nNext month the economy will notch the longest expansion in U.S. history, growing for more than a decade since the Great Recession officially ended in 2009. Trump boosted growth with tax cuts, higher levels of government spending and more deregulation, but Democrats have charged that some of these changes amounted to a “sugar high” that will wear off and ultimately damage the economy.\n\nThere are numerous signs that the economy’s strength last year might prove short-lived.\n\nManufacturing indexes have fallen to the lowest levels of Trump’s presidency, reflecting weaker demand and fears that Trump’s adversarial approach to trade is leading companies at home and abroad to pull back on spending.\n\nAmid signs that some manufacturers are pulling back, Trump has gone on the attack. He has lashed out at several iconic companies, including Harley-Davidson and General Motors, over announcements of cutting domestic jobs, and he said last week he was pushing Lockheed Martin not to curb production at a helicopter plant in Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump has tried to point to individual companies that he sees are cutting jobs, but the impact of these threats is unclear. Businesses cut back on capital investment in the first three months of the year even though they continued to benefit from sweeping tax cuts at the end of 2017.\n\nThe Morgan Stanley Business Conditions Index recorded its largest one-month drop on record in June and is now at its lowest level since December 2008, when the U.S. economy was in the middle of a recession.\n\n“We see this underlying deterioration. It’s been a slow bleed,” said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income. Piegza has been especially alarmed by slowing private domestic sales, an indication that U.S. demand is likely weakening.\n\nAnalysts and White House officials, however, have stressed that there are still numerous bright spots in the economy and have cautioned against overreacting to a few blips in the data.\n\n“Trump has deeply held convictions on trade. A few short-term data points aren’t going to change his mind,” said one senior official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nAbout 70 percent of the U.S. economy is driven by consumer spending and consumer confidence remains strong, with retail spending jumping in April and May. Inflation remains low, and wages have been growing fastest for working-class Americans.\n\nThe U.S. economy added just 75,000 jobs in May, many fewer than expected, but the unemployment rate is 3.6 percent. White House officials believe wages and consumer spending will help lift the economy despite other factors even if businesses continue to pull back investing.\n\n“In the end, you have to judge whether the data are making sense,” Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview. “The thing that makes sense to me is we get saved from the slowdown by the consumer right now because income growth has been so high.”\n\nTrump and business leaders are both looking to the Fed for a possible lift. The stock market has rebounded in recent weeks, largely based on investor belief that the Fed will step in to counter any widespread harm from the tariffs.\n\nWall Street is forecasting an 85 percent chance of a rate cut in July and will be watching Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell’s news conference closely Wednesday for signs he is ready to act soon.\n\n“The Fed is going to try to act sooner rather than later. If they wait too long, it will be much more difficult to get out of trouble,” said Andrew Levin, a former Fed economist who now teaches at Dartmouth.\n\nThe biggest concern, however, remains how Trump plans to resolve the escalating trade fight with China. Trump has imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports and threatened to penalize an additional $300 billion in imports if China doesn’t agree to major concessions. Talks with China began last year and continued for months before unraveling in May. Trump has said that if Xi doesn’t meet with him next week during the G-20 summit in Japan, the United States would be prepared to move forward with new tariffs.\n\n“The economy is not close to a recession this year, but next year is a lot more problematic,” said Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments who writes a daily political newsletter. “If we go into 2020 with no China deal, that’s going to be a significant negative for him in terms of business uncertainty, farmer uncertainty, weaker economic growth and maybe even a little touch of inflation.”\n\nMore than 320 companies and industry groups are testifying at the United States Trade Representative’s office this week and next about their fears that imposing tariffs on all Chinese imports will cause significant price increase, job losses and profits to shrink. But inside the White House, some advisers point out that hundreds of thousands of companies were not bothered enough to testify or even submit comments about the tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. economy grew 2.9 percent in 2018, the highest level since 2015, according to the Commerce Department. White House officials have predicted growth will be even stronger this year, but few others concur. The economy grew 3.1 percent in the first three months, but a number of analysts predict it will grow less than 2 percent between April 1 and the end of September.\n\nTrump has shown no sides of backing down, particularly in his trade fight with China or in his budget impasse with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. But he has also shown a penchant for pivoting sharply when confronted by bad polls or a stock market dip, numbers that he watches closely.\n\n“The White House doesn’t need to panic, but there are reasons to be nervous,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist who advised Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) during his 2008 presidential run. “We were always going to slow down from 3 percent growth. The question is, to what? If we slow down to 2.5 percent, that’s a huge victory. If we slow down to 1.5 percent, that’s a much tougher reelection sell.”",

        "text": "\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nThe Federal Reserve signaled Tuesday that it is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep the U.S. economy on solid footing, including taking action to alleviate the harm from President Trump’s trade war.\n\nFed Chair Jerome H. Powell said the central bank is watching the situation closely and will take any “appropriate” action.\n\n“We are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook, and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion,” Powell said Tuesday at a conference in Chicago.\n\n[Trump says tariffs on Mexican imports to take effect next week, despite Mexican optimism for a deal]\n\nStocks surged after Powell’s comments Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping 400 points. Calls have escalated in recent days for the central bank to cut interest rates to help boost the economy and counter the negative effects of Trump’s trade battles with China and Mexico.\n\n“I think it’s safe to say this is the first time Powell himself has opened the door to an actual rate cut,” said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*Trade.\n\nWall Street investors now think there’s a 58 percent chance that the Fed will slash interest rates by the end of July, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. It’s a strong change from a month ago, when hardly anyone was predicting that interest rates would be cut this summer.\n\nSome economists are forecasting a recession or sharp downturn if Trump moves forward with tariffs on all Chinese imports and a new tariff on all Mexican imports as soon as next week.\n\n[Trump says he would have sued E.U. over Brexit, but Theresa May is ‘probably a better negotiator’]\n\n“Our cycle indicator has shifted out of ‘expansion’ to ‘downturn’ for the first time since 2007,” Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients this weekend. “This phase-change has historically meant a worse backdrop for returns and higher chances of recession or a bear market.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly urged the central bank to cut interest rates and has tried to nominate additional Fed governors who support his view that rates should be lower.\n\nThe Fed’s committee that sets interest rates will meet next on June 18-19, but the central bank is widely expected not to act yet, as it is still unclear whether Trump will move ahead with additional tariffs that he has threatened to put on China and Mexico.\n\n“We don’t know how or when these issues will be resolved,” Powell said Tuesday.\n\nAnother Fed leader was even more direct this week in saying a rate cut may be needed soon.\n\n“The direct effects of trade restrictions on the U.S. economy are relatively small, but the effects through global financial markets may be larger,” St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Monday at a talk in Chicago. “A downward policy rate adjustment may be warranted soon.”\n\nThe U.S. benchmark interest rate is currently 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent.\n\nRelated:\n\nGOP lawmakers discuss vote to block Trump’s new tariffs on Mexico, in what would be a dramatic act of defiance\n\nTrump defies close advisers in deciding to threaten Mexico with disruptive tariffs",

        "text": "President Trump’s plan to slap new tariffs on Mexican imports, weeks after escalating his trade war with China, leaves the United States fighting a multi-front campaign that threatens more instability for manufacturers, consumers and the global economy.\n\nThe president’s bombshell announcement that he would impose 5 percent tariffs on Mexican imports, with the possibility of raising them to 25 percent if Mexico does not stop migrants from crossing into the United States, left some economists fearing there were few limits to Trump’s appetite for trade conflict.\n\n“In our view, if the U.S. is willing to impose tariff and non-tariff barriers on China and Mexico, then the bar for tariffs on other important U.S. trading partners, including Europe, may be lower than we previously thought,” Barclays economists said in a research note. “We think trade tensions could escalate further before they de-escalate,” Barclays added.\n\nAdam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, called Trump’s move against Mexico a turning point for financial markets and the U.S. economy.\n\nIn global markets Friday, investors spooked by new tariff threats sought safety in German government bonds and the euro rather than their customary dollar-denominated havens. This “seems to me an indicator that the concerns about the U.S. are rising,” Posen said.\n\nThe president’s latest move rocked business leaders who were already scrambling to reshape supply chains to avoid fallout from the U.S. confrontation with China. The added uncertainty may paralyze executives who cannot be sure their next supply-chain location will be any safer than their last.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump speaks at the U.S. Air Force Academy graduation Thursday in Colorado. (David Zalubowski/AP)\n\n“A lot of companies feeling pressure to get out of China are looking at Mexico if they want to serve the U.S. market, Vietnam if they’re more focused on Asia,” said William Reinsch, a former Commerce Department trade official. Trump’s action “scrambles all those plans,” he said.\n\nIn one example of a company caught in the crossfire, GoPro of San Mateo, Calif., last month announced it would move manufacturing of some of its cameras from China to Mexico, so that it could stop paying tariffs to import them to the United States — tariffs resulting from the U.S. trade war with China. Weeks later, GoPro faces new tariffs to import those goods from Mexico. The company declined to comment Friday.\n\nAs U.S. companies race to find tariff-free places to manufacture, so far few have reported returning production to the United States, despite the president’s stated aim of using trade policy to help bring jobs back home. Many are still seeking alternative locations overseas, where labor is cheaper.\n\nTrump said he would impose the new tariffs because the Mexican government was not doing enough to stem the flow of migrants, many of whom travel through Mexico from Central America. Some White House officials who support Trump’s approach believe the threat of tariffs is the only way to get the attention of Mexican leaders.\n\nThe Mexican government tried to defuse the tension Friday, saying the two sides would meet in Washington on Wednesday for high-level talks.\n\nIf no solution is found, Mexico is certain to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, with probable targets including U.S. pork, beef, wheat and dairy products, said former Mexican diplomat Jorge Guajardo.\n\nSome prominent Republicans, including Senate Finance Chairman Charles E. Grassley (Iowa), raised concerns that the new tariffs could threaten a trade agreement the Trump administration clinched only months ago with Mexico and Canada to replace the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n\nOthers said the about-face treatment of Mexico would damage Trump’s ability to negotiate trade deals it is pursuing with other partners, including China and Europe.\n\n“You can’t negotiate a trade agreement with someone and then turn around and whack them,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist and former Congressional Budget Office director.\n\nIn late March, Trump threatened to shut the entire southern border to curb illegal immigration but backed down a week later after an outcry. That has left some wondering how seriously they should take the latest tariff threat.\n\nIf Trump follows through with new tariffs on Mexico, it would hurt U.S. economic growth and increase the possibility of the Federal Reserve reversing course and cutting interest rates this year, economists said.\n\n“The drag to the U.S. economy could be meaningful, especially if the tariffs reach 25%,” the upper limit that Trump has set, Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists wrote Friday. Even if the tariff remains at 5 percent, the effective cost could be higher because many parts cross the border several times as products are assembled, and the tariff must be paid upon each crossing into the United States.\n\nU.S. automakers will be among the principal casualties. Last year, the United States imported roughly $350 billion in merchandise from Mexico, including about $85 billion in vehicles and parts, according to the International Trade Administration.\n\nA full 25 percent tax “would cripple the industry and cause major uncertainty,” according to Deutsche Bank Securities.\n\n“The auto sector — and the 10 million jobs it supports — relies upon the North American supply chain and cross-border commerce to remain globally competitive,” said Dave Schwietert, interim president of the Auto Alliance, an industry group. “This is especially true with auto parts which can cross the U.S. border multiple times before final assembly.”\n\n“Widely applied tariffs on goods from Mexico will raise the price of motor vehicle parts, cars, trucks, and commercial vehicles — and consumer goods in general — for American consumers,” the industry group said. “The potential ripple effects of the proposed Mexican tariffs on the U.S. North American and global trade efforts could be devastating.”\n\nConsumers could pay up to $1,300 more per vehicle if the tariffs are implemented, according to Torsten Slok, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities.\n\nRetailers, technology companies and textile manufacturers also will be hurt. U.S. mills ship yarn and fabric to Mexico, where it is turned into apparel and exported back to American retailers. Last year, the U.S. textile industry exported $4.7 billion in yarn and fabrics to Mexico, its largest single market.\n\n“Adding tariffs to Mexican apparel imports, which largely contain U.S. textile inputs, would significantly disrupt this industry and jeopardize jobs on both sides of the border,” said Kim Glas, president of the National Council of Textile Organizations.\n\nThe dispute with Mexico comes as the U.S.-China trade conflict continues to deepen.\n\nChina on Friday announced it would establish a blacklist of “unreliable” foreign companies and organizations, effectively forcing companies around the world to choose whether they would side with Beijing or Washington.\n\nThe “unreliable entities list” would punish organizations and individuals that harm the interests of Chinese companies, Chinese state media reported, without detailing which companies will be named in the list or what the punishment will entail.\n\nChinese reports suggested the Commerce Ministry will target foreign companies and groups that abandoned Chinese telecom giant Huawei after the Trump administration added Huawei to a trade blacklist last month, which prohibited the sale of U.S. technology to the Chinese company.\n\nAt a time when Western corporations have cut back executive travel to China after authorities detained two Canadians on national security grounds in December, the blacklist sent another shock wave through the business community.\n\n“I think foreign and especially U.S. firms now have to worry that China is creating a new ‘legal pretext’ to at least impose exit bans on foreign individuals who make this new list, if not worse,” said Bill Bishop, the editor of the Sinocism newsletter, referring to the Chinese practice of not allowing designated foreigners to leave China.\n\nAside from the blacklist, China in recently days also escalated threats to stop selling the United States so-called rare earths — 17 elements with exotic names such as cerium, yttrium and lanthanum that are found in magnets, alloys and fuel cells and are used to make advanced missiles, smartphones and jet engines.\n\nAnalysts said it could take years for the United States to ramp up rare-earths production, after its domestic industry practically disappeared in the 1990s. Roughly 80 percent of U.S. imports of the material come from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThe People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s official mouthpiece, carried a stark warning for the United States on Wednesday in an editorial about rare earths: “Don’t say we didn’t warn you.”\n\nThe commentary surprised China experts because the People’s Daily, which often signals official positions with subtly codified language, uses that phrase sparingly: It famously appeared before China launched border attacks against India in 1962 and Vietnam in 1979.\n\nDamian Paletta contributed to this report.

        "text": "\n\nThe Mountain Pass mine’s crusher, which breaks down ore before it is milled, late last month in California. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nRusty tin shacks are all that remain of the gold miners who once prowled this desert hillside about an hour’s drive southwest of Las Vegas. Almost a century later, their modern-day descendants are prospecting for the more exotic materials that have become the latest flash point in the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nThis is Mountain Pass, the only mine in the United States that harvests rare-earth elements, the raw ingredients used to produce high-tech products such as smartphones, wind turbines, electric vehicles and fighter jets.\n\nChina dominates the global market for these materials and has been threatening to take them hostage in the deepening trade conflict. Just the suggestion that Beijing could starve American factories of essential materials has sent rare-earth prices soaring over the past month, with dysprosium oxide, used in lasers and nuclear-reactor control rods, up by one-third.\n\nBut the alarm overlooks the rise over the past decade of alternative sources of rare earths — including Mountain Pass — and ignores the difficulties China would face in implementing a ban, including the prospect of widespread smuggling and the likelihood of hurting countries that Chinese authorities may prefer not to alienate.\n\n“We have an absolutely world-class resource,” said Michael Rosenthal, chief executive of MP Materials, which operates the California mine. “That’s our competitive advantage.”\n\nPresident Trump, fresh from an immigration dispute with Mexico, pivoted Monday to his stalled China trade talks. In a CNBC interview, the president — expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month in Japan — said their “differences can be worked out very easily.”\n\nBut Xi shows no sign of caving and may use rare earths as a bargaining chip. In the latest sign that China might reprise its 2010 cutoff of exports to Japan, the powerful National Development and Reform Commission said on June 4 that it would set new limits on sales outside China.\n\n“We must strengthen export management and control,” the state planning agency said. “We need to establish a mechanism for investigating and tracing the export flow of rare earths.”\n\nA U.S. Commerce Department report this month fanned industry worries, warning of a dangerous dependence upon imported materials, including rare earths, and calling for “unprecedented” action to bolster domestic stockpiles.\n\nMountain Pass, which began post-bankruptcy operations only last year, represents the United States’ best hope of weathering any Chinese materials blockade. Along with new output from countries such as Australia and Myanmar, the U.S. mine helped cut China’s share of global production to 71 percent last year from more than 97 percent in 2010, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\n“We can make the Chinese threat become a hollow threat very quickly by letting market forces take care of it,” said Douglas Paal, a China expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former vice chairman of JPMorgan Chase International. “China does not have us by the throat.”\n\nFrom the rim of the open-pit mine, bulldozers, excavators and 70-ton trucks can be seen chewing through layers of ebony and chocolate earth more than 500 feet below. Exploratory drilling has penetrated more than 1,800 feet without finding the end of the rare-earth deposit here, an indication of its untapped potential.\n\n\n\nSlings of rare-earth concentrate are loaded aboard a flatbed truck at the Mountain Pass mine. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\n\n\nRare-earth minerals flow down a conveyor belt, ultimately headed for a processing facility in China. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nJoe Pascoe, principal engineer at the Mountain Pass Mine, holds some of the powdery concentrate. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nOfficials have begun contingency planning to accelerate production in the event of a Chinese cutoff, Rosenthal said. Though Mountain Pass could not fill all domestic needs, it could boost output of substances needed for oil refining and some specialized magnets.\n\nYet the mine’s role at the center of the U.S.-China faceoff over 17 elements with names such as neodymium, terbium and europium is not without irony.\n\nMountain Pass ships its main product — a powdery substance that looks like crushed cocoa — to China for processing before it is sold to Chinese customers. A Chinese rare-earths producer, Leshan Shenghe, holds a nonvoting 10 percent stake in the U.S. mine.\n\nSince June 1, the mine’s shipments to China have been hit with a 25 percent tariff from China, retaliation for Trump’s latest import tax. For now the company is absorbing the added costs, so officials are squeezing savings out of their suppliers, searching for cheaper shipping companies and making sure they are not paying uniform-rental fees for workers who have quit.\n\n“We are literally going around shutting off lights,” Rosenthal said.\n\nEven as the trade war intensified, the Americans and Chinese here continued cooperating. Rosenthal, 41, who speaks fluent Mandarin, says the Shenghe team provides advice on the mixtures to use in the ore’s chemical bath. Zhou Jihai, 66, a senior Shenghe engineer, says the Chinese company is learning from MP about automation.\n\nSpeaking through an interpreter, Zhou acknowledged that some industry colleagues in China criticize Shenghe for helping the Americans. But he waved off trade-war questions.\n\n“It does not affect too much our cooperation. It only affects the relations between the two countries,” he said. “We hope the two sides can reach some sort of compromise.”\n\nIn July 2017, JHL Capital Group, a Chicago-based hedge fund, and QVT Financial, a New York investment firm, spent $20.5 million to bring the site out of bankruptcy. Production last year exceeded any under the previous owner, Molycorp, and the venture now is operating at a profit. Performance over the past six weeks has been the best to date, Rosenthal said.\n\n“I can’t say we’re entirely satisfied with our results yet. We have a lot of work to do still,” he said. “But we feel good we’re on the right path here.”\n\nMolycorp filed for bankruptcy in mid-2015, a victim of falling commodity prices and China’s market dominance.\n\n\n\nMichael Rosenthal, chief executive of MP Materials, which operates the Mountain Pass Mine, scrutinizes a key part of the sprawling operation. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nMP’s hopes of competing with Chinese rivals — mostly state-owned enterprises that receive government subsidies and face lower labor and environmental costs — rest on the quality of its ore deposit and the relative ease of distilling it into salable products. Despite the tariff head wind, the mine is profitable, Rosenthal said.\n\n“That says something about our ability to compete,” he added.\n\nMP Materials has made progress by reversing some of the previous owner’s decisions. Molycorp bet heavily on “caustic cracking,” which strips a less valuable material known as cerium from the rare-earth concentrate.\n\nBut the process required a roughly $300 million building that Rosenthal said was “extraordinarily expensive” to operate and did not work as well as the traditional method. Now the structure is scorned as the “crack house” and sits idle.\n\nThe Mountain Pass operation is as simple as digging a big hole in the ground and as complex as the most sophisticated industrial chemistry.\n\nJames Litinsky, founder of JHL, the hedge fund that led the formation of MP Materials, said the mine reflects a shift away from the mutual vulnerability that has characterized the global economy for the past two decades. Trump’s 2017 executive order requiring the government to “reduce the nation’s vulnerability to disruptions in the supply of critical materials” bears him out.\n\n“The world needs to protect against a single point of failure in the supply chain,” he said. “In the context of rare earths, that happens to be China.”\n\nStanding in a control room, Rosenthal gazed at a computer display monitoring a critical operation. This is the “ball mill,” a building dominated by a giant metal drum that resembles a cement mixer.\n\nA mix of ore, dirt and rocks entered the vessel on a conveyor belt, where it was buffeted by jets of water and steel balls before passing through vats of chemicals — a laborious process designed to cause the rare earths to bubble to the surface of an industrial stew.\n\nThe company’s success or failure turns on what happens in this building. Green, blue and purple lines oscillated in a narrow band on the computer screens as the air vibrated with a mechanized hum. One monitor showed a spike like a bad electrocardiogram, a sign that output was not as consistent as desired.\n\n“We have to — have to — get this building right,” Rosenthal said, adding that MP Materials aspires to produce rare earths “at the lowest cost in the world.”\n\n\n\nThe view inside the mill where rare earths are separated from tons of rock and dirt at the Mountain Pass Mine. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nThe task of adjusting the chemical bath for each batch of excavated ore is complicated by the need to recycle and reuse enormous quantities of water. That is a legacy of the facility’s troubled history in the 1980s, when spills from a pipeline carrying radioactive wastewater to a distant dry lake bed led to a federal investigation and costly cleanup.\n\nUnlike Molycorp, MP Materials recycles its wastewater by forcing the liquid waste from the “ball mine” through giant filters made of synthetic fiber. Environmental regulations require that even rainwater runoff here has to be captured and treated.\n\nNot everyone is confident the United States can endure an interruption of Chinese shipments.\n\nThough Chinese labor and environmental costs are rising, some analysts doubt MP’s chances of becoming a low-cost producer. Jim Kennedy, a St. Louis-based consultant, said MP cannot compete in the long run against China, the only country with a supply chain that encompasses mining, intermediate processing facilities and factories to produce products such as laptops and electric cars.\n\nKennedy, a longtime advocate of a federally-chartered cooperative to bolster U.S. rare-earths production, said the Mountain Pass deposit also lacks the full roster of rare earths, particularly the \"heavy\" minerals optimized for technology and defense production.\n\n“There’s no challenging China’s rare-earth monopoly with market forces,” he said.\n\nAny cutoff of Chinese exports would be disruptive. But most of the material needed by American tech companies is used in factories in China, not the United States. So Beijing would need to choke off exports of products made with rare earths, too, a broader embargo that would probably claim other countries — and Chinese factory workers — as collateral damage.\n\nFoxconn, a Taiwanese company, uses rare earths in Shenzhen, China, to make key parts of Apple’s iPhone. Tesla relies on the materials for magnets produced by Beijing Zhong Ke San Huan High-Tech Co.\n\nThe United States last year imported only $160 million worth of rare earths, virtually unchanged from 2010.\n\nIn many cases, there are alternatives. During the 2010 supply interruption, one company that had used neodymium to polish glass “found that they were able to use something else to do the same job that was easily available,” said Sage Chandler, vice president for international trade at the Consumer Technology Association. “Many other companies did the same.”\n\nIt is also hard to imagine any embargo being foolproof. Despite official Chinese attempts to stamp out illegal production, rogue operations last year produced an estimated 60,000 tons of rare earths, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. That means American customers would almost certainly obtain some supplies in the event of an export ban.\n\n“Fears are overstated. . . . There’s plenty of non-Chinese supply at current levels in Australia and the U.S. if you reallocated things for critical needs,” said Eugene Gholz, who worked on supply chain issues in the Pentagon during the Obama administration and now teaches at University of Notre Dame.\n\nAs the trade war simmers, MP executives are preparing for a future of enduring U.S.-China acrimony. Work is underway on the facilities needed to process the mined material on site rather than send it to China. What remains to be done is a matter of work and money rather than invention.\n\n“We’re at this critical point,” Rosenthal said, “where things are coming together.”",

        "text": "Huawei workers leave at the end of the workday at a new sprawling campus in Dongguan, near Shenzhen, China. (Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump’s latest swipe at China suggests that more than a year of negotiations aimed at a sweeping trade deal with Beijing may instead produce agreement only on the terms of an economic divorce.\n\nThe relationship between the two nations hasn’t deteriorated to quite that point — yet. But on Thursday, tensions ratcheted up again as China vowed to take “all necessary measures” in response to the administration’s latest action, which placed the Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei Technologies on a U.S. export blacklist.\n\nThe move against one of China’s most prominent companies, a politically connected symbol of the Chinese government’s aspirations to technology leadership, upended prospects for an early resumption of negotiations and appeared to invite a harsh Chinese response.\n\n[As Trump fights with China over trade, U.S.-China economic relationship is already being redefined]\n\nIt also led some analysts to warn that after four decades of ever tighter economic ties, the Trump administration might seek to decouple the world’s two largest economies — a step that could shake the global economy.\n\n“The United States could not have taken a more provocative action against China’s economy,” said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “This action is potentially devastating not only to Huawei the company but to the networks around the world that run on Huawei equipment. This action certainly now puts the entire economic relationship up on the table.”\n\nTrump was personally involved in the deliberations over punishing the Chinese company. He arrived late to a Roosevelt Room meeting Wednesday about his immigration plan, saying he had been working on China trade issues. The president acknowledged that China would be unhappy with his Huawei decision, saying it could complicate trade negotiations.\n\nBut he described the decision as unavoidable, repeatedly remarking that China is taking over the world because of its technical prowess.\n\n“Unless we stand up now, there’s not going to be a chance to do it in the future,” the president said, according to one attendee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a confidential conversation.\n\n[Graphic: The first round of China tariffs already stifled U.S. exports]\n\nWith Trump scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in six weeks at the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, the timing of the strike against Huawei puzzled many observers. “I was surprised by the timing,” said Dennis Wilder, a former China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency. “Is this just Trump giving himself another card to play? Or has he come over to the side of those in the administration who favor decoupling?”\n\nDerek Scissors, a China expert and occasional administration adviser who has called for the United States to cut ties with China, said the president did not support a full rupture and was simply “arming himself for Osaka.”\n\nThe trade talks themselves are on life support. After Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers this week that U.S. officials planned to return to Beijing soon for more bargaining, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday he didn’t know what the treasury chief meant.\n\n[Under Trump, the U.S. enters a new ‘Cold War’ with China]\n\nThe United States and China are starting to resemble “a very, very unhappy divorced couple that has to share the house for financial reasons and engages in constant warfare over who gets to sit on the couch and control the television remote,” said Henry Farrell, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University.\n\nStill, any attempt to disentangle the two giant trading partners would be daunting.\n\nU.S.-China merchandise trade has nearly tripled since 2004 to a total of $660 billion last year. Cargo moving between the two countries represents roughly one of every six U.S. dollars.\n\nThe interdependence also is financial: China holds more than $1.1 trillion in U.S. Treasurys, making it the largest single foreign holder of the government securities.\n\nAs post-Mao China embarked on economic reforms starting in the late 1970s, U.S. presidents of both parties celebrated the potential gains for American companies and anticipated that Chinese political liberalization would follow.\n\nBut under Xi, China has taken an authoritarian turn, while Trump has emphasized the need to resolve long-standing U.S. complaints about Chinese trade-secret theft and discrimination against foreign companies. Washington also now sees China much more as a strategic adversary than a potential partner, further encouraging advocates of decoupling.\n\nThe Commerce Department action against Huawei capped years of U.S. government unease about the security implications of doing business with the company, the largest telecommunications equipment maker in the world.\n\nBoth the Obama and Trump administrations worried that Huawei could engineer technological back doors in its equipment that would permit Chinese officials to spy on Americans or, in times of conflict, disrupt or paralyze critical U.S. networks.\n\n“Huawei is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interest,” the Commerce Department said in announcing that it was adding the company and its affiliates to the “entity list.”\n\nAs a result, any company that wants to sell American technology to Huawei must first obtain a government license — a requirement that threatens to sever the Chinese company’s U.S. supply lines.\n\nOn Wall Street, investors broadly took the latest trade-war drama in stride, though companies that supply Huawei took a beating. The Dow Jones industrial average rose almost 215 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 25,862.68.\n\n“The US-China economic relationship is too important — and has the potential to generate too much wealth — to be sacrificed for short-term protectionism,” Jim Glassman, head economist with JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking, wrote Thursday in a research note. “Neither side would benefit from disrupting the flow of trade or reversing the integration of the global economy.”\n\n[Trump takes aim at China’s tech sector. That could hurt U.S. innovation.]\n\nThat may or may not be the Trump administration’s view. Over the past year, the administration has taken a number of steps to slow or reverse economic integration between the United States and China.\n\nThe screening process for Chinese companies’ proposed U.S. investments has gotten tougher. New regulations to limit the export to China of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and robotics are being drafted. And Washington is getting stingy with visas for Chinese academics, students and business people.\n\nTrump’s serial tariff rounds also have U.S. importers paying the highest average duties in more than a quarter century, according to Scotiabank, a Canadian bank.\n\nAdministration officials have adopted an increasingly harsh tone toward China since a landmark October speech at the Hudson Institute by Vice President Pence, warning companies of the dangers of doing business with China, including forced technology transfer, rampant theft of intellectual property and cyberespionage.\n\n“China seems determined to steal its way up the economic ladder at our expense. . . . The reality is that some of these threats are existential threats to them as a business,” FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said in April.\n\nEven if the trade talks produce a meaningful accord, both countries are likely to take divergent paths in areas including the development of advanced technology.\n\nTrump’s advisers from the outset have been split over the goal and extent of the trade rebalancing with China. Mnuchin is among those seeking to preserve lucrative trade and investment ties. Others such as Peter Navarro, director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, want to return lost factories to American soil.\n\n“It just seems like a total misunderstanding of reality,” said Carlos Gutierrez, chairman of Albright Stonebridge Group and commerce secretary in the George W. Bush administration. “So much of what happens here starts in China. . . . It is unrealistic to assume that we can take all those supply chains that we built over there and somehow separate ourselves from China.”\n\nU.S. efforts to limit China’s global economic role already have stumbled. Despite high-profile warnings about Huawei, the United Kingdom and Germany refused to exclude the company from supplying their 5G networks.\n\nLikewise, Italy, another U.S. ally, brushed aside Washington’s objections and joined Xi’s signature global infrastructure program, the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\n“China is not decoupling itself from the world. If anything, China is tying itself to the world even more,” said Gutierrez. “At a time when there are people whispering in the president’s ear that we can decouple ourselves, it seems like strategic suicide.”\n\nJosh Dawsey contributed to this report.",

        "text": "\n\nPresident Trump greets supporters upon his arrival in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Friday. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump said Friday that he is picking his close ally Stephen Moore to fill an open seat on the Federal Reserve Board. Trump has repeatedly blamed the Fed for hurting the economy.\n\nMoore was an adviser to Trump’s campaign and published a book “Trumponomics: Inside the America First Plan to Revive Our Economy,” heralding the president’s tax cuts and deregulation push. Trump and Moore have discussed the Fed in recent weeks, with Moore telling the president that his other Fed nominees were too “conventional” and didn’t understand the president’s economic vision. Moore publicly urged Trump to fire Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell in December, which most experts think isn’t legally possible.\n\nThe White House plans to make a formal announcement that Moore is the nominee to fill one of two open Fed seats. Moore, who holds a master’s degree in economics and is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, would then go through a Senate confirmation process that could take months. His nomination is likely to face opposition from Democrats.\n\n[Federal Reserve cuts growth forecast, signals no more rate hikes in 2019]\n\nMoore is widely viewed as the most political nominee to the Fed board since the Reagan era. He published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal last week titled “The Fed Is a Threat to Growth,” and he has suggested that Trump deserves a Nobel Prize in economics.\n\n“Trump, who is not an economist, has more sense of the economy than these 500 overpaid economists at the Federal Reserve,” Moore told The Post at the end of January.\n\nOn Friday, Moore attempted a more conciliatory approach, telling Bloomberg TV that he looks forward to working with Powell and that he called for the Fed chair’s removal in “a time of anger.”\n\n“I really do believe we could have 3 or 4 percent growth for another five or six years,” Moore said Friday. “I know [Powell] wants high growth. He can be a hero if we get our monetary policy right at the same time we have strong pro-growth measures on the fiscal side of the equation.”\n\n[Trump won't get a sustained boom without an infrastructure bill and more tax cuts]\n\nPast presidents have typically nominated to the board PhD economists and longtime bankers, who tended to be centrists. The Fed is an independent agency that is not supposed to be influenced by politics, and there are concerns that Moore would chip away at that independence. The central bank’s primary role is setting the level of interest rates, which influence mortgage and credit card rates, and bank regulation.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin played a heavy role in Trump’s other Fed nominations, and many economists and Wall Street investors welcomed those picks, but Trump began to regret some of his choices and called the Fed “loco” in October.\n\nThis time, Trump saw Moore’s Wall Street Journal op-ed and asked Larry Kudlow, head of the National Economic Council, why Moore wasn’t Fed chair. Kudlow said he told the president that the Fed already has a chairman, but Moore would be a “perfect Fed governor.”\n\n“Steve Moore is a brilliant guy. He knows a lot about monetary policy,” Kudlow said. “People who are attacking Steve are attacking him for his beliefs.\"\n\n\n\nStephen Moore, visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, stands for a photograph after a Bloomberg Television interview in Washington on March 22. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)\n\nTrump has said numerous times that the economy and markets would be in better shape if the Fed had not raised interest rates four times last year, actions meant to keep the economy from overheating and get rates back to a more normal level as the nation recovered from the Great Recession.\n\n“Frankly, if we didn’t have somebody that would raise interest rates and do quantitative tightening, we would have been at over 4 instead of a 3.1,” Trump said in a Fox Business interview Friday.\n\nThe president was implying that the pace of growth last year could have been more than 4 percent without the Fed rate hikes, an assertion many independent economists doubt. The official Commerce Department figure is 2.9 percent growth for last year, but an alternative measure of growth used by many economists is that the economy expanded by 3.1 percent in 2018.\n\nThe Fed dramatically changed direction this year as growth in China and Europe weakened and the government partially shut down. On Wednesday, the vast majority of Fed leaders indicated that they do not foresee rate hikes this year. It was a big change from December, when many Fed leaders anticipated two more hikes in 2019.\n\n\"Growth is slowing somewhat more than expected,” Powell said Wednesday as the Fed cut its growth forecast down to 2.1 percent for this year.\n\n[Fed Chair Powell tells Congress it’s ‘very troubling’ that so few Americans are working]\n\nPowell has remained stoic in the face of Trump’s criticism. He has repeatedly declined to comment on the president but has defended the Fed and its nonpartisan decision-making. He has also forged close ties with members of both parties in Congress.\n\n“It’s very important that the public understand that we are always going to make a decision based on what we think is right for the American people,” Powell said in a recent interview on the CBS program “60 Minutes.”\n\nA number of economists expressed shock that Moore could soon be on the Fed board, which can have as many as seven members.\n\n“This is the first genuinely bad Trump pick for the Fed,” tweeted Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan. “He hasn’t gotten a thing right in twenty years, (check the record), and the Senate should not confirm him.”\n\nMoore has flip-flopped on his views about the Fed since Trump was elected. When Barack Obama was in office and the country was trying to climb out of the Great Recession, Moore called for tighter monetary policy because he feared hyperinflation from the Fed’s low interest rates at the time.\n\nOnce Trump took office, Moore began calling for lower interest rate. The Fed has interest rates at a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent, the highest level in a decade, but low by historical standards.\n\nMoore has argued that the economy is experiencing deflation, in which prices fall, but the Commerce Department’s inflation metrics show that prices are rising about 1.5 percent a year. He has also called for the Fed to try to intervene to keep commodity prices such as soybeans more stable, even though soybean prices fell sharply last year largely because of Trump’s trade war with China.\n\nIf confirmed, Moore would not be able to single-handedly lower interest rates or change other Fed policies. Major Fed decisions are made by a committee of up to 12 members — the seven governors nominated by the White House and five heads of regional Fed banks who are chosen by those communities.\n\n“One voice does not determine Fed decisions,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.",

        "text": "\n\nPresident Trump delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Feb. 5. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nPresident Trump has promised an economic boom that will last for years to come, but he’s unlikely to get one without the help of Congress to pass major new legislation, according to estimates by Trump’s own economic team.\n\nTo achieve about 3 percent growth for the next decade, Trump would need a big infrastructure bill, more tax cuts, additional deregulation, and policies that transition more people off government aid and into full-time jobs, according to the 2019 Economic Report of the President, released Tuesday by Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nThere’s skepticism that Trump will be able to get all of these policies through Congress, especially with Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) leading the House.\n\n“Washington is a really hard place to get things done,” said Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, but he stressed that his biggest concern for growth is Trump’s policies getting rolled back or Medicare-for-all becoming reality.\n\n[Has U.S. growth peaked?]\n\nThe report shows for the first time that the White House is predicting a lot weaker growth if all of those new policies do not come through. Growth would be about 2.5 percent in 2022 if no additional policies are implemented, according to White House calculations. By 2026, growth could fall to about 2 percent, the model suggests.\n\nA lot is riding on whether Trump can achieve his promised 3 percent growth. Without it, his tax cuts would add substantially more to the debt than they already have and Democrats would have an easier time hammering his economic track record.\n\nTo achieve the higher growth rate, the White House assumes that the individual tax cuts will be made permanent (they’re currently slated to expire after 2025) and that Congress will pass an infrastructure bill “commencing in 2019 with observable effects beginning in 2020,” the report says. While there’s widespread agreement that the United States needs a major infrastructure upgrade, there’s a big gap between the Democratic and Republican visions of what to do.\n\nThe report calls it a “key downside risk” to the forecast if Congress doesn’t pass the rest of the president’s agenda.\n\n\n\nWhite House growth projections from Page 529 of the 2019 Economic Report of the President. The red line shows the forecast if no additional policies are implemented.\n\nThe 3 percent White House growth prediction — which is used in the president’s budget and has been criticized by outside experts as a “gimmick\" — also assumes more deregulation, especially in the finance industry, and a push for “improving self-sufficiency” by placing more work requirements on recipients of government aid. Some of those initiatives might be possible to implement through executive action.\n\nTrump is relying on a strong economy to drive his reelection campaign. He often takes a victory lap about his economic achievements on Twitter and at rallies, touting stock market gains, record-low unemployment numbers and a “booming economy.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly called the Obama economy, which averaged just over 2 percent growth per year, mediocre, so Trump wants to be able to say he presided over faster economic growth.\n\n[Betpo O’Rourke appears with GM union leader maligned by Trump, pledging to be 'helpful']\n\nMany economists have described the Trump economy as a sugar high. They have predicted that growth will spike after the president passed a large tax cut and drove up government spending, and that growth will return to about 2 percent by 2020 — or that the economy could tumble into a recession.\n\n“We’ve always said 3 percent growth for one year was possible after we gave the economy a lot of stimulus. But you can’t keep giving the economy more stimulus every year,” said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at a Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. “There’s nobody that thinks we’re going to be anywhere close to 3 percent growth a year over the next decade.”\n\nThe White House has pushed back against the naysayers, arguing that the economy has exceeded expectations since Trump took office and shows little sign of slowing.\n\n“For the second consecutive year, economic growth has either matched or surpassed my Administration’s forecast, and the economy has growth at a 3.1 percent rate over the last four quarters,” Trump wrote in the report.\n\nForecasting where the economy is headed is notoriously difficult, but Hassett and his team say that their predictions were almost spot on the past two years and that they think many on Wall Street are underestimating the Trump White House again.\n\n“Everyone said we wouldn’t get 3.1 percent,” Hassett said. “We’re relying on the same analysis because nothing has come up which suggests to us it’s not going to happen.”\n\nHassett says the corporate tax cut, which was the largest in U.S. history, is spurring a business investment boom that will lift the economy for years to come. But others disagree.\n\n“We’ve not seen any meaningful pickup” in business spending “because of the tax package,” former Federal Reserve chair Janet L. Yellen, who headed the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton, said in a recent interview with Marketplace. “We had a period of remarkable growth in 2018, probably around 3 percent. That just isn’t sustainable.”\n\nRelated:\n\nTrump blames union leader for GM job cuts in Ohio — jobs the president once vowed he’d save\n\nWorkers suddenly have more power to demand higher pay and better jobs\n\nHas growth peaked? Economists see a slowdown. Trump doesn’t.",

        "text": "President Trump presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to economist Arthur Laffer in the Oval Office on Wednesday. (Oliver Contreras for The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump on Wednesday awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to economist Arthur Laffer, a former top Ronald Reagan adviser whose theory of supply-side economics has long been a lightning rod for controversy.\n\n“Few people in history have revolutionized economic theory like Arthur Laffer,” Trump said at a ceremony in the Oval Office. “I’ve heard and studied the Laffer curve for many years. A very important thing you did, Art.”\n\nLaffer’s economic philosophy — that tax cuts will spur economic growth, which will in turn increase government revenue — has been embraced by Republicans over the years, including former president George W. Bush, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney and Trump.\n\nBut Laffer’s critics — Democrats and Republicans — argue that there is little evidence to support his theory, popularly known as the “Laffer curve,” and that it inflates budget deficits.\n\n“He more than any single living person is responsible for the GOP’s cowardly betrayal of its historic commitment to fiscal rectitude,” former Reagan budget director David Stockman told NPR via email. He lambasted Laffer as “the greatest Fake Economist to ever come down the pike.”\n\nAlso criticizing Laffer’s economic approach on Wednesday was Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), who is running for president.\n\n“Laffer is the last person who deserves a Medal of Freedom,” Inslee said in a tweet. “You don’t grow the economy by giving tax cuts to billionaires. We’ve blown up that GOP myth in WA. We have the fastest-growing economy because we build from the middle-out, not trickle down.”\n\nAfter Republican Sam Brownback took office as Kansas governor in 2011, Laffer advised him on a far-reaching tax-cut plan that ended income taxes for 200,000 small businesses and cut rates for top earners. The plan led to a hefty budget shortfall and ended up almost costing Brownback his reelection 2014 as voters revolted over the impact on school funding, the state’s rising poverty rate and its downgraded credit rating.\n\nIn 2017, Kansas Republicans reversed most of the tax cuts, overriding Brownback’s veto.\n\nLast month, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service issued a report showing that the 2017 Trump federal tax cuts championed by Laffer have not led to higher economic growth. Laffer has said his policies simply need more time to bear fruit.\n\nTogether with Stephen Moore, who recently abandoned his bid for a Federal Reserve seat amid uproar over his writings about women, Laffer last year co-wrote “Trumponomics: Inside the America First Plan to Revive Our Economy.” Trump praised the book in a tweet, declaring that the authors “have really done a great job in capturing my long-held views and ideas.”\n\nIn a television interview earlier this month, Moore suggested that Trump should nominate Laffer to succeed Kevin Hassett in the White House’s top economist job.\n\n“Well, look, I know from talking to the president that he thinks that Laffer is the best economist in the country; he would love to have Arthur,” Moore said on Fox Business. “The question is, what you and I need to do is put the pressure on Arthur Laffer to accept the job.”\n\nDespite having served as an adviser to Trump, Laffer has occasionally parted ways with the president, particularly on trade. Laffer told Vice News that he has advised Trump against ratcheting up trade tensions, arguing that his threats against America’s trading partners could backfire.\n\n“He’s trying to get their attention — bang! — so we really get true, free trade,” he said. “I believe. Now, does it scare me? Yes . . . I am terrified of a trade war. Protectionism is a killer. And it kills your industries that are protected, and it kills your economy.”\n\nLaffer has also drawn criticism for an April interview on Fox News in which he blamed former president Barack Obama for the 2007-2009 recession. Obama took office in January 2009. Most experts say the financial crisis was caused by a combination of factors unrelated to Obama.\n\n“If you’ll remember, coming into the election in 2008, when Obama started rising in the polls and doing well in the polls, the stock market crashed,” Laffer said in the interview. “And the stock market tells you what will be, not what has been. And the stock market looks forward. And if they see an Obama coming into the office, they’ll crash, and that’s what led to the Great Recession.”\n\nIn its final report in 2011, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission cast blame for the crisis on factors including risky practices in the financial industry, lax regulation and federal housing policy.\n\nZachary Goldfarb contributed to this report.",

        "text": "\n\nSmoke pours from U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works in Clairton, Pa., in 2010. (Keith Srakocic/AP)\n\nU.S. Steel announced it will temporarily halt production at two domestic plants despite the boost from the Trump administration’s tariffs, as a steel industry singled out for federal support shows signs of weakening.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Steel said it would temporarily halt operations at a blast furnace near Detroit as well as one in Gary, Ind., on the shore of Lake Michigan. U.S. Steel will be idling a third plant in Europe, the company said.\n\nThe closure runs in sharp contrast to the narrative President Trump has offered about the steel industry. Tuesday night in Orlando, as he formally announced he was running for reelection, Trump boasted about helping the steel industry through the use of tariffs on imports.\n\n“Thanks to our tariffs, American steel mills are roaring back to life, you know that,” he said.\n\nThe moves come amid broader concerns about a slowdown in the steel industry, which threatens to derail a key economic priority of the Trump administration. Despite initially surging under the tariffs, steel prices have fallen dramatically amid weakening demand from key consumers, including the auto, energy and agricultural industries, said Phil Gibbs, a steel industry analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets.\n\nPrices of hot-rolled coil — a key metric — have fallen from their peak last year of $900 a short ton to less than $600 a short ton, said James Moss, a steel industry consultant at First River Consulting, based in Pittsburgh.\n\n“At the moment, the market is a little sideways,” Moss said.\n\nLast year, Trump imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports, citing national security concerns. The tariffs remain in effect for China and most countries, although they have been curbed in a limited number of exceptions, such as for Canada and Mexico.\n\nTrump’s tariffs helped the steel industry’s resurgence in 2017 and 2018, leading to soaring profits and company plans to restart old plants. Amid the favorable business climate, contract negotiations last year led U.S. Steel workers to receive their biggest pay increases in years.\n\nTrump celebrated the steel industry’s improvement under his administration, calling it a key success story of his tariffs. Last month, he tweeted that “in one year Tariffs have rebuilt our Steel Industry — it is booming! . . . we now have a big and growing industry.”\n\nBut steel prices have since fallen dramatically from 2018 to 2019, in part because of weakening demand across Europe as well as weakening demand in the United States. ArcelorMittal also announced last month it will be idling steel mills in Europe.\n\nTrump’s steel tariffs may help curb the competition facing American steel producers in domestic markets, but Chinese steel can still help drive down prices in Europe and in other competitive markets, industry analysts say.\n\n“It can still show up in multiple different places, and not necessarily with the ‘China’ brand on it,” Moss said. “There’s a supply component of this which has not gone away, despite the tariffs. ”\n\nTrump’s steel tariffs are costing U.S. consumers and businesses more than $900,000 a year for every job created, according to a report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank that supports free market policies.",

        "text": "\n\nA tweet Tuesday announcing a meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sent stock markets soaring. (Qilai Shen/Bloomberg News)\n\nPresident Trump said Tuesday morning that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had agreed to meet with him at the Group of 20 summit next week, a major development amid the ongoing trade war between two of the world’s largest economies.\n\nTrump, in a Twitter post, wrote that he had spoken with Xi by telephone to confirm the meeting. Trump has said for days that he hoped to meet with Xi at the summit in Osaka, Japan, but Chinese officials had not yet confirmed the meeting would occur.\n\n“Had a very good telephone conversation with President Xi of China,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “We will be having an extended meeting next week at the G-20 in Japan. Our respective teams will begin talks prior to our meeting.”\n\nThe Twitter post sent the U.S. stocks sharply higher, as investors had long worried that a protracted trade battle between the two nations could damage the U.S. economy and hurt numerous companies.\n\nChina’s Xinhua News, a state-run entity, wrote in a Twitter post following Trump’s announcement that the call came “at request” of the White House. And CCTV, a Chinese state broadcaster, quoted Xi as saying he is looking forward to the meeting.\n\n“As the two largest economies in the world, China and the United States should play a leading role in promoting positive outcomes of the Osaka Summit of the Group of Twenty and injecting confidence and vitality into the global market,” Xi said, according to CCTV. “I would like to meet with Mr. President during the Osaka Summit of the leaders of the Group of Twenty to exchange views on fundamental issues related to the development of Sino-US relations.”\n\nTrump has long alleged that the Chinese government rips off U.S. consumers and businesses through unfair trade practices, such as stealing intellectual property, luring away U.S. manufacturers, manipulating currency and subsidizing domestic companies in a way that makes it hard for U.S. firms to compete.\n\nLast week, he insisted that China would eventually capitulate to his demands because of the economic damage his tariffs were inflicting on the country.\n\n“China is going to make a deal, because they are going to have to make a deal,” Trump said during an interview with CNBC.\n\nTrump has imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports to the United States and threatened to impose tariffs on another $300 billion in goods if Xi refused to meet with him at the G-20 summit.\n\nThe two leaders last met in late 2018, at a G-20 summit in Argentina. At a dinner with top advisers, Trump and Xi agreed to negotiate to resolve the trade battle. But those talks broke down several weeks ago, when U.S. officials accused their Chinese counterparts of backtracking on several commitments.\n\nAmong other things, Trump has demanded that China purchase more U.S. goods and create restrictions on the theft of intellectual property. A number of Democrats have supported Trump’s tough tactics, but U.S. businesses have been alarmed that Trump has so far refused to cut a deal with Xi. This uncertainty has led a number of businesses to freeze investment as they wait to see whether the trade war will be resolved soon.\n\nTrump made standing up to China a centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign, and he is set to announce his reelection campaign Tuesday night in Orlando.\n\nTariffs are a type of tax paid by U.S. companies when they import goods from another country. Those costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. By making the foreign products more expensive, Trump has said the goal of tariffs is to push companies to move production to the United States.\n\nTrump has used tariffs as a key tool in both economic and foreign policy. Two weeks ago, he threatened to impose a 10 percent tariff on all goods entering the United States from Mexico, but Mexico agreed to discuss new efforts to stem a surge of migrants at the border, and Trump indefinitely postponed the import penalties.\n\nThe tariffs on Chinese products are much steeper, however, affecting 25 percent of the $250 billion in goods. These tariffs apply to business equipment, furniture, computer products and a range of other materials. Hundreds of companies are in Washington this week petitioning the Trump administration for exemptions from future tariffs, as some have alleged their companies would be decimated if Trump follows through with his threat to impose tariffs on the remaining $300 billion in goods that hasn’t been penalized. A final decision on whether to impose those tariffs was expected to be made after the Osaka summit.\n\nTrump said last week that he would move forward with those tariffs if Xi refused to meet at the G-20.\n\nA number of Republicans have attacked the White House for relying on tariffs as a way to push foreign countries to change their behavior, alleging that he is effectively creating new taxes on U.S. businesses and consumers. But Trump has called himself “Tariff Man” and said he uses the tariffs as a way to exert leverage on foreign leaders to prompt concessions.\n\nChinese leaders have vowed to retaliate against Trump’s tariffs with penalties of their own against U.S. exporters. U.S. agriculture companies, particularly soybean farmers, have complained that they have been caught in the middle of the trade war and have seen Chinese purchases of their products plummet. To ameliorate the burden on farmers, many of whom come from states that will be key to Trump’s reelection, the White House has authorized billions of dollars in direct payments to offset the lost revenue.\n\nGerry Shih contributed to this report.",

        "text": "President Trump opened the door Tuesday to possibly firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, an almost unprecedented attack on America’s central bank just as top Fed leaders are meeting in Washington to decide what to do on interest rates.\n\n“Let’s see what he does,” Trump said when a reporter asked him whether Powell should be removed as chair.\n\nThe Fed will make an announcement at 2 p.m. Wednesday about whether it is keeping interest rates the same or reducing them. Trump has repeatedly urged the Fed to cut interest rates to juice growth.\n\n[The fate of Trump’s economy now hinges on the Federal Reserve]\n\nThe White House counsel looked into whether Trump could remove Powell as Fed chair in February, according to a Bloomberg News report Tuesday. Trump started asking advisers whether he could fire Powell in December after markets dipped on fears of the escalating trade war with China and the Fed’s plans for more rate hikes in 2019.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers have told him it’s not legally possible to get rid of Powell and National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow insisted Tuesday that there was no White House push to remove the Fed chair. But the president’s ire about Powell has not subsided.\n\n“I want to be given a level playing field, and so far I haven’t been,” Trump said before boarding a plane to Florida to launch his reelection campaign.\n\n[Trump may be about to face his biggest test yet on the economy]\n\nWall Street investors expect the central bank will not slash rates this week but will signal a strong likelihood of a cut in July or September. Powell has said he would not step down if Trump asked him and that he plans to serve out his full term through February 2022.\n\nOn the presidential campaign trail, Trump complained that interest rates were too low and were giving the Obama economy an unfair boost, but since he has taken office he now complains that rates are too high and holding back the economy’s potential.\n\nU.S. interest rates are just shy of 2.5 percent, a low level historically but the highest level in more than a decade.\n\nTrump chose Powell, a Republican lawyer who spent many years at a private equity firm, for the top position at the Fed in late 2017. Powell was confirmed by the Senate and started his term as chair in February 2018.\n\n[Who is Jerome Powell?]\n\nFed governors can only be removed “for cause,” which courts have generally interpreted as criminal wrongdoing, but some have wondered if there is a loophole where Powell could be demoted from the chair position back to one of the seven governor roles, allowing Trump to select someone else as chair.\n\nIt would be especially helpful for the Fed to lower rates now to provide stimulus as Trump goes head-to-head with China on trade, a move that many economists and business leaders say is hurting the economy.\n\nPowell has cultivated close ties on Capitol Hill and has the backing of many Republicans and Democrats in Congress.\n\n“We should make sure that the independence of the Fed is above politics as much as you can and doesn’t accommodate one group or another, or one person or another, or one president or another, but does what’s best for the economy,” said Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nMany business leaders have also publicly backed Powell and an independent Fed. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon told reporters last week that the Fed under Powell’s leadership is “very professional, very capable and pretty much doing the right stuff.”\n\n“The independence of the Fed needs to be sacrosanct. The president should leave that alone,” said Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller & Washington, a wealth management firm.\n\nFarr noted that President Richard M. Nixon pressured the Fed chair at the time to keep rates low to boost Nixon’s reelection chances, but it turned out to be painful for the economy when it spurred years of high inflation.\n\nTrump complained in tweets Tuesday morning that the European Central Bank is stimulating Europe’s economy but that the Fed isn’t doing that.\n\nThe European central bankers “have a much different stance than our folks do,” Trump lamented. “[ECB President] Mario Draghi just announced more stimulus could come, which immediately dropped the euro against the Dollar, making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the USA.”\n\nPowell has said he wants to keep the economy thriving as long as possible and will do whatever it takes to do that, but he also believes the United States is doing well enough right now that it doesn’t need near-zero interest rates anymore as it did in the aftermath of the Great Recession.\n\nThe Fed is supposed to act in the best long-term interest of the U.S. economy and not cave to short-term political pressure.\n\nErica Werner contributed to this report.\n\nRelated:\n\nTrump may be about to face his biggest test yet on the economy",

        "text": "\n\nJudy Shelton, U.S. executive director for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, after a meeting in Washington on May 29. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)\n\nPresident Trump wants the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and he’s looking to fill the remaining two spots on the central bank’s board with people who agree with his views.\n\nConservative scholar Judy Shelton is the latest potential Fed candidate to catch the Trump team’s eye.\n\nThe Federal Reserve decided against cutting interest rates Wednesday, but signaled they may take such action soon.\n\nHowever, that may not be fast enough for Trump. On Tuesday, Trump held out the possibility of attempting to remove the central bank chair if the Fed doesn’t cut rates, a legally questionable step that has never been done before in the United States.\n\nThe president is also looking to fill the two spots on the Fed’s governing board with people who share his views on reducing interest rates.\n\nShelton has discussed a potential role on the Fed board with the White House and has begun the paperwork, she said, but she has not been formally nominated or mentioned by Trump. The president’s preferred picks, businessman Herman Cain and ally Stephen Moore, had so little support among Senate Republicans that they withdrew from consideration.\n\nShelton was an economic adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign, holds a PhD in business administration from the University of Utah and says she would like to see the Fed cut rates steeply -- possibly to zero.\n\n“I would lower rates as fast, as efficiently, as expeditiously as possible,” Shelton said in an interview this week in the lobby of Trump International Hotel in Washington.\n\n[On eve of critical Fed meeting, Trump suggests he might remove Chair Jerome H. Powell]\n\nTrump argues that low interest rates would trigger faster growth and says he doesn’t understand why the Fed is worried about inflation when it has been modest for years and shows no sign of spiking. Shelton agrees with Trump that it’s a mistake for the Fed to tap the brakes on the economy right now.\n\n“The goal is still job creation even though it’s low employment,” she said, adding that she supports Trump’s economic agenda of lower taxes, less regulation and a battle with China over trade.\n\nShelton’s main reason for wanting to reduce interest rates is more technical than Trump’s. She believes the Fed should stop paying interest on the “excess reserves” that banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America hold at the Fed. This practice started during the financial crisis and has become the main way that the Fed now affects the economy, but Shelton thinks it’s time to end it.\n\n“Because I’m so against paying interest on excess reserves, in a way, I’m radically in favor of eliminating 235 basis points [on interest rates],” Shelton said. She suggested a “glide path” of “maybe one to two years” to take the interest rate the Fed pays on excess reserves from the current level of 2.35 percent back down to zero.\n\n[Companies in furious bid to prevent new China tariffs as summit looms]\n\nShe is clear that she would like to see interest on excess reserves go to zero, and she suggested that the Fed’s main benchmark interest rate could also be reduced substantially without doing any harm to the economy.\n\n“Let’s say they do bring it down 100 basis points in the next six months. Do you think that will cause inflation to go up?” Shelton said. “I don’t know the answer to that anymore.”\n\nShelton is soft-spoken and perceived by many in Washington as less combative than Trump’s last two intended Fed nominees, Moore and Cain. She has already been confirmed by the Senate to be the U.S. executive director for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which might make it easier for her to win Senate approval to be a Fed governor.\n\nBut her beliefs about the Fed are outside the mainstream. She has long preached that the United States needs “sound money” and should consider returning to the gold standard. She has gone as far as to call for global leaders to meet at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort to hammer out a new monetary system so countries like China can’t manipulate their currencies.\n\nTrump’s “a disrupter and we need a disruptive voice on the Fed as well,” Shelton said in a November 2017 interview.\n\nHer critics say she wants to blow up the Fed and would be Trump’s lackey, but she says she hasn’t spoken with the president and that her views on central banking have been public for years and haven’t changed. She says she communicates with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow, who has been a longtime friend and is leading the search for Fed nominees.\n\n“I believe in transparency at the Fed. So I believe you might as well know what I think, because I wouldn’t change,” she said. “I don’t talk to the president.”\n\nIn the interview with The Washington Post, she called herself a “populist” and a “nationalist” and questioned whether the nation even needs the Fed, although she clarified that her main goal is to get the Fed to change its ways, not to abolish it.\n\nShe acknowledged that if she’s nominated and confirmed for a Fed role, she would be one of 12 members on the central bank’s policy setting committee and that there’s only so much she could affect on her own.\n\n“What could one person do? I don’t know,” she said. “I would just say my first battle I would pick would be paying interest on excess reserves.”\n\nFor years banks operating in the United States have been required to keep some money — known as required reserves — deposited at the Fed to ensure they have enough cash on hand to pay customers. But during the financial crisis, the Fed began incentivizing banks to keep extra money — known as excess reserves — at the Fed by paying banks interest on those extra reserves above the mandated limit.\n\nThe excess reserves held at the Fed provided an additional cushion, similar to a rainy-day fund, to ensure that the U.S. banking system had enough money to function. But it also had the side effect of becoming the main tool the Fed now has to affect the economy. When the Fed raises interest rates, banks typically want to keep more excess reserves parked at the central bank. And when the Fed lowers rates, banks typically want to take some of the excess reserves they were holding at the Fed and lend them to homeowners and small businesses.\n\nCurrent Fed leaders believe this excess reserve system works well and gives them even more ability to fine tune the economy, but Shelton, who rose to prominence in the 1980s for her prediction that the Soviet Union would collapse, views what the Fed is doing as too much government meddling in the banking system.\n\n“This is like universal income for banks. They get paid to do nothing,” said Shelton, who pointed out that banks earn 2.35 percent interest from the Fed on their reserves while most American savers are getting 0.1 percent. “I think that’s just so demoralizing to the whole idea of capitalism.”\n\nRelated:\n\nTrump may be about to face his biggest test yet on the economy\n\nThe fate of Trump’s economy now hinges on the Federal Reserve, the agency the president called ‘crazy’\n\nThere are three ways the U.S.-China trade war could end. Two would be bad for America.",

        "text": "President Trump opened the door Tuesday to possibly firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, an almost unprecedented attack on America’s central bank just as top Fed leaders are meeting in Washington to decide what to do on interest rates.\n\n“Let’s see what he does,” Trump said when a reporter asked him whether Powell should be removed as chair.\n\nThe Fed will make an announcement at 2 p.m. Wednesday about whether it is keeping interest rates the same or reducing them. Trump has repeatedly urged the Fed to cut interest rates to juice growth.\n\n[The fate of Trump’s economy now hinges on the Federal Reserve]\n\nThe White House counsel looked into whether Trump could remove Powell as Fed chair in February, according to a Bloomberg News report Tuesday. Trump started asking advisers whether he could fire Powell in December after markets dipped on fears of the escalating trade war with China and the Fed’s plans for more rate hikes in 2019.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers have told him it’s not legally possible to get rid of Powell and National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow insisted Tuesday that there was no White House push to remove the Fed chair. But the president’s ire about Powell has not subsided.\n\n“I want to be given a level playing field, and so far I haven’t been,” Trump said before boarding a plane to Florida to launch his reelection campaign.\n\n[Trump may be about to face his biggest test yet on the economy]\n\nWall Street investors expect the central bank will not slash rates this week but will signal a strong likelihood of a cut in July or September. Powell has said he would not step down if Trump asked him and that he plans to serve out his full term through February 2022.\n\nOn the presidential campaign trail, Trump complained that interest rates were too low and were giving the Obama economy an unfair boost, but since he has taken office he now complains that rates are too high and holding back the economy’s potential.\n\nU.S. interest rates are just shy of 2.5 percent, a low level historically but the highest level in more than a decade.\n\nTrump chose Powell, a Republican lawyer who spent many years at a private equity firm, for the top position at the Fed in late 2017. Powell was confirmed by the Senate and started his term as chair in February 2018.\n\n[Who is Jerome Powell?]\n\nFed governors can only be removed “for cause,” which courts have generally interpreted as criminal wrongdoing, but some have wondered if there is a loophole where Powell could be demoted from the chair position back to one of the seven governor roles, allowing Trump to select someone else as chair.\n\nIt would be especially helpful for the Fed to lower rates now to provide stimulus as Trump goes head-to-head with China on trade, a move that many economists and business leaders say is hurting the economy.\n\nPowell has cultivated close ties on Capitol Hill and has the backing of many Republicans and Democrats in Congress.\n\n“We should make sure that the independence of the Fed is above politics as much as you can and doesn’t accommodate one group or another, or one person or another, or one president or another, but does what’s best for the economy,” said Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nMany business leaders have also publicly backed Powell and an independent Fed. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon told reporters last week that the Fed under Powell’s leadership is “very professional, very capable and pretty much doing the right stuff.”\n\n“The independence of the Fed needs to be sacrosanct. The president should leave that alone,” said Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller & Washington, a wealth management firm.\n\nFarr noted that President Richard M. Nixon pressured the Fed chair at the time to keep rates low to boost Nixon’s reelection chances, but it turned out to be painful for the economy when it spurred years of high inflation.\n\nTrump complained in tweets Tuesday morning that the European Central Bank is stimulating Europe’s economy but that the Fed isn’t doing that.\n\nThe European central bankers “have a much different stance than our folks do,” Trump lamented. “[ECB President] Mario Draghi just announced more stimulus could come, which immediately dropped the euro against the Dollar, making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the USA.”\n\nPowell has said he wants to keep the economy thriving as long as possible and will do whatever it takes to do that, but he also believes the United States is doing well enough right now that it doesn’t need near-zero interest rates anymore as it did in the aftermath of the Great Recession.\n\nThe Fed is supposed to act in the best long-term interest of the U.S. economy and not cave to short-term political pressure.\n\nErica Werner contributed to this report.\n\nRelated:\n\nTrump may be about to face his biggest test yet on the economy",

Following in the footsteps of music-streaming service Spotify, the workplace messaging application is set to start trading with a direct offering instead of an IPO. (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg)\n\nU.S. markets notched solid gains Thursday on signs of impending rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 setting a new all-time high and putting the index on track for its best June since 1955.\n\nThe S&P 500 beat its own record shortly after the markets opened, then climbed further to close at 2,954.18. The Dow Jones industrial average also surged, climbing nearly 250 points and coming within 1 percent of its own record.\n\nThe power run comes on the heels of the markets’ worst May since 2010, as investors struggled to parse the risks from President Trump’s multi-front trade conflicts. Though the Fed board wrapped up meetings this week without announcing a rate cut, they indicated a willingness to do more to shore up the economy against any slowdowns tied to the trade war. Nearly half of the Fed leaders are calling for rate cuts before year’s end — a dramatic shift from March, when no one was talking about the possibility.\n\n“The case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,” Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said Wednesday. “It’s really trade developments and concerns about global growth that are on our minds . . . Risks seem to have grown.\"\n\n[Federal Reserve expresses concern about U.S. economy and signals interest rate cuts are likely]\n\nAfter Powell’s comments, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield slipped as low as 1.97 percent, the first time the benchmark has fallen below 2 percent since November 2016.\n\nU.S. markets held steady and remained in positive territory this week after Trump announced he would be meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the upcoming G-20 summit in Japan, giving investors hope for a truce in the U.S.-China trade war. Economists and business leaders have been pressing for de-escalation over worries that a protracted fight might weaken the economy, both domestically and globally.\n\n“Even as there is skepticism about any likelihood of meaningful breakthroughs on trade negotiations, the fact that Pres. Trump has confirmed that he will meet with Chinese Pres. Xi next week is giving some optimism that a potential trade deal with China is to be reached in the near future,” Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer at Tigress Financial Partners, wrote in a note to investors Thursday.\n\nCrude oil prices soared after Iran announced it had shot down a U.S. military drone, caused investors to fear for future oil supplies. Tensions have been rising since last week, when U.S. authorities blamed Iran for an attack on two oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz. Oil prices rose 6 percent, settling near $56 a barrel.\n\nPopular workplace messaging company Slack beat expectations with its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, with trading starting at $38.50, well above its reference price of $26. It jumped as high as $42 before closing at $38.62, giving it a $19.5 billion valuation.\n\nThe company eschewed the typical IPO process in favor of a direct listing, which allows company investors and other stakeholders to sell directly to the market without issuing new shares.\n\n“The big thing for us was in the traditional IPO, it’s the company that’s offering shares, you might raise, you know, a billion dollars or something like that,” Slack chief executive Stewart Butterfield said Thursday during an interview on CNBC. “When you raise a billion dollars, you dilute existing shareholders, by issuing new shares. So, we are not doing that. We’re just opening it up for trading.”\n\nSpotify, the only other major company to go public with a direct listing, debuted in April 2018 with a reference price of $132. Its stock has climbed about 15 percent since.",

        "text": "Shortly after ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, Stewart Butterfield, chief executive and co-founder of Slack, said going public had benefits. It opens the company up to a degree of scrutiny that large customers will find helpful, he said. When Slack was private, some customers asked to see its financials to ensure the company was sustainable, he said.\n\n“Now that doesn’t have to happen. Now there’s a lot more transparency,” he said. “Starting three years ago, we started trying to run Slack as a public company. We have been building toward this for a long time.”\n\n[Read about how Slack’s chief executive, Mr. Butterfield, had to learn to dial back his mouthiness.]\n\nSlack grew out of TinySpeck, a gaming start-up co-founded by Mr. Butterfield in 2010 that did not catch on. TinySpeck’s internal chat tool, which uses an early internet protocol called Relay Chat to let colleagues exchange messages and collaborate, showed promise. Mr. Butterfield reoriented the company around the chat product, publicly releasing Slack in 2014.\n\nThe tool quickly spread among tech start-ups, catching the attention of Silicon Valley investors. Slack became a “unicorn,” a term used to describe start-ups valued at $1 billion or more, in less than a year. At the time, Mr. Butterfield said in an interview that the valuation was somewhat arbitrary and not based on the precise methods of valuing a business, given how young Slack was and how quickly it was growing. Over five years, investors poured more than $1 billion into the company.\n\nAs it grew, Slack also attracted potential acquirers such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon. But Mr. Butterfield rejected any deal and Slack is now used by more than 600,000 organizations with 95,000 paying customers. Some of the rebuffed tech giants, such as Microsoft, have gone on to challenge Slack with their own workplace collaboration products.\n\nWayne Kurtzman, a research director at IDC, said Slack was part of a shift in the workplace where people are moving from static files to collaborative applications. “It’s a battle for the work space and where work will get done,” he said. Slack’s challenge, he added, is to show customers it is more than just a messaging app.\n\nIn its investor materials, Slack differentiated itself from the incumbents by saying it was focused on collaboration and was not distracted by old products or other priorities. The company promoted a directory of 1,500 applications built by partners, designed to let people automate aspects of their jobs, like responding to customer service messages or monitoring social media comments.",

Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell \" Thursday. \"I think it's very important for them to stop right now what they're doing so that we can get a handle on this.\"\n\nFacebook has faced widespread scrutiny in the days following its plan to launch a global cryptocurrency. The social network's announcement Tuesday caught the attention of Waters and other senior congressional finance committee members, global regulators, former lawmakers and industry insiders who questioned Facebook's ambitions.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Waters asked Facebook to delay the project, which she said was a continuation of its \"unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.\"\n\n\"We don't have a regulatory agency to oversee who they are and what they're doing,\" Waters said Thursday on CNBC. \"This is like starting a bank without having to go through any steps to do it.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Facebook announced that it would launch a cryptocurrency run by the nonprofit Switzerland-based Libra Association in 2020. The project will not be controlled or fully run by Facebook, according to its white paper. It's also being run by a collaboration of organizations and companies that include Stripe, Uber, Mastercard, Visa, PayPal and Spotify. But Facebook has plans to profit from it through a new subsidiary, Calibra, that is building a digital wallet to store and exchange the cryptocurrency.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that Facebook spoke to the central bank about the digital currency and that to his knowledge, the social network has made \"quite broad rounds around the world with regulators, supervisors and lots of people to discuss their plans, and that certainly includes us.\"\n\nWaters is not the only Congress member pushing back on Facebook's plan. The senior Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, highlighted \"its potential unprecedented impact on the global financial system\" and called for a hearing. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said, \"Facebook is already too big and too powerful, and it has used that power to exploit users' data without protecting their privacy.\"\n\n\"We look forward to responding to lawmakers' questions as this process moves forward,\" a Facebook spokesperson told CNBC.\n\nWaters highlighted consumer protection, data and privacy issues and \"ways that Facebook has conducted itself in the past\" as reasons for a congressional hearing.\n\n\"There are a lot of issues with Facebook,\" she said. \"They're creating their own cryptocurrency — it's going to be an alternative to the dollar, so I think it's very important for them to stop right now what they're doing so that we can get a handle on this.\"\n\n",

        "text": "Chinese companies are lobbying up as the Trump administration targeted Chinese telecommunications giants Huawei and ZTE. | Miquel Benitez/Getty Images lobbying Chinese companies spend big to fend off Trump Chinese companies' decisions to hire lobbyists have been driven in part by looking at what’s happened to Huawei and ZTE over the last year.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has done everything he can to squeeze Huawei over the past year, bringing criminal charges against the Chinese telecommunications company, moving to block it from buying American technology and trying to convince foreign governments to crack down on the company.\n\nNow other Chinese companies are turning to K Street to keep the same thing from happening to them.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nEight other Chinese companies have spent at least $7.9 million hiring Washington lobbying and public relations firms since last spring, right before Trump cracked down on a different Chinese telecom company, ZTE, according to a POLITICO analysis of disclosure filings. That’s nearly eight times what the same companies spent in the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe companies — including a Chinese radio company, a state-owned railcar manufacturer and a maker of surveillance cameras — have hired more than two dozen additional lobbyists over the past year, including former lawmakers and Trump campaign veterans.\n\nThe ramp-up shows how Chinese companies, which in the past have been hesitant to play the Washington influence game, are increasingly worried about threats from the Trump administration, as well as Democrats and Republicans in Congress eager to crack down on China. And it’s another sign that Trump’s trade war with China is driving business on K Street.\n\n“It’s sent shock waves,” Amiad Kushner, a New York lawyer who represents Chinese companies in the U.S., said of the administration’s crackdown on Huawei and ZTE.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/3864/1155968404_6054383789001_6054385821001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nThe willingness of Chinese companies to hire lobbyists has been driven in part by looking at what’s happened since Trump decided to home in on Huawei and ZTE last year.\n\nThe Trump administration banned ZTE from doing business with American companies after it was found to have sold equipment to Iran and North Korea in violation of U.S. sanctions. ZTE has responded by spending millions of dollars on lobbying, including hiring former Sens. Joe Lieberman and Norm Coleman and two lobbyists who worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign, David Urban and Bryan Lanza, according to disclosure filings.\n\nThe lobbying, along with direct appeals from Chinese President Xi Jinping, appears to have worked. Trump agreed to lift the ban — which would have been a potentially fatal blow to ZTE — if the company paid a $1 billion fine and made other concessions.\n\nHuawei’s approach to its own battle with Trump so far has been the opposite — and the company has little to show for it.\n\nHuawei decided more than a year ago that it wouldn’t be worthwhile to lobby Congress or the Trump administration after it was accused of helping the Chinese government spy on users of its equipment, according to a person familiar with the company’s strategy. While Huawei retains a few lobbyists, the company decided to wage the bulk of its fight in the courts and in the press, the person said.\n\nHuawei sued the federal government in March, arguing that a law passed last year singling out Huawei and four other Chinese companies is unconstitutional.\n\n“This sets a dangerous precedent,” Song Liuping, Huawei’s chief legal officer, said at news conference last month. “Today it's telecoms and Huawei. Tomorrow it could be your industry, your company, your consumers.”\n\nThe company also hired Racepoint Global, a Boston public relations firm, in March to help craft its tweets and promote its message, Larry Weber, the firm’s chairman, said in an interview.\n\nHuawei's chief legal officer, Song Liuping, argued a law cracking down on his company was unconstitutional. | Dake Kang/AP Photo\n\nIt hasn’t made much difference. The Commerce Department last month put Huawei on a trade blacklist, prompting small wireless providers to complain it could cost them hundreds of millions of dollars to replace Huawei equipment on their networks.\n\nWhile Trump has described the agreement his administration reached with ZTE as “a good deal,” he told reporters last month that Huawei remained “very dangerous.”\n\nWilliam Plummer, a former Huawei lobbyist in Washington who was laid off last year, wrote in a self-published e-book that the company repeatedly ignored its lobbyists’ suggestions to take “a stronger and more timely approach to protecting and projecting Huawei’s brand.”\n\n“Huawei HQ simply didn’t get it,” he wrote. Huawei and ZTE didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nOther Chinese companies facing potential threats from Congress and the administration have followed ZTE’s lead and ramped up their spending in Washington.\n\nHikvision, a Chinese surveillance camera manufacturer that’s partially state-owned, has shelled out nearly $1.8 million to hire Washington lobbyists and public relations hands over the past year, including former Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.) and Lanza, the former Trump campaign aide. The administration is considering blacklisting Hikvision and another Chinese company, Dahua Technology, but hasn’t done so yet.\n\nFujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, a Chinese semiconductor manufacturer, has hired lobbying and law firms since the Trump administration blacklisted it last year. The prominent Republican lobbyist Marc Lampkin is among those advocating for the company. Hikvision and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, a law and lobbying firm that represents Fujian Jinhua, didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nDJI, a Chinese drone company, hired the lobbying firm BGR Group in April to offer “strategic guidance and counsel on legislation or regulations that could impact” the company, according to a disclosure filing.\n\nTwo security researchers told senators they were wary of DJI’s drones during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing Tuesday. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) suggested a potential ban on Chinese-made drones.\n\n“I think we’re crazy to do business with the Chinese,\" Scott said during the hearing. \"We ought to be buying American products in every way we can.”\n\nDJI called those concerns baseless in a statement to POLITICO, saying it “gives customers full and complete control over how their data is collected, stored and transmitted.”\n\nSome Chinese companies are still looking for help, according to four people at Washington lobbying and public relations firms that have fielded inquiries from Chinese companies in recent months.\n\nTrump’s crackdown on Huawei has “spooked Chinese companies,” one of these people wrote in an email to POLITICO. They believe “ZTE was able to buy/lobby their way out of trouble and want to be prepared.”\n\nThen-acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker announced criminal charges on Huawei earlier this year. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nChinese companies have few allies in Washington at the moment, as Democrats and Republicans alike have expressed eagerness to crack down. Lawmakers slipped a provision into a defense spending bill last year prohibiting government agencies from buying some telecommunications equipment from Huawei, ZTE and three other Chinese companies or contracting with firms that use such equipment.\n\n“It was a complete surprise to us,” said Steve Cragg, a vice president at Hytera, a Chinese radio manufacturer that was named in the bill.\n\nHytera hired a lobbying firm, Duane Morris Government Strategies, to discover why the company had been singled out. It still doesn’t have any answers, Cragg said.\n\nByteDance, the Chinese company behind the popular app TikTok, registered its first Washington lobbyist earlier this month. The company declined to comment on why it sought representation in Washington.\n\nBYD Motors, a Chinese electric bus company, and CRRC, a state-owned railcar manufacturer, have added lobbyists in recent months to try to keep Congress from passing bills that would make it harder for American transit systems to buy trains and buses from the companies, disclosure filings show. (Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), whose district include a BYD plant, helped scrap a similar measure last year while serving as House majority leader.)\n\nLawmakers grilled a BYD official at a House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee hearing last month, during which Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), the committee’s chairman, described BYD as “a company that is very heavily subsidized by the government of communist China.”\n\nRep. Harley Rouda (D-Calif.), who sponsored the House version of the transit bill, said in an interview that he expected its provisions to be included in this year’s defense spending bill, which is currently making its way through Congress. The bill is necessary to protect domestic manufacturers and address cybersecurity fears, he said.\n\nWhile CRRC and BYD have lobbied against the legislation, “my sense is they have not had a lot of success,” Rouda said. Neither company responded to requests for comment.\n\nCRRC will try to get the measure stripped out of the defense spending bill when lawmakers reconcile the House and Senate versions, a person familiar with the company’s strategy said, though it won’t be easy.\n\n“A lot of members of Congress have made their minds up about China and all things Chinese,” the person said.\n\nDavid Beavers contributed to this report.",

        "text": "The UN calls Myanmar’s treatment of the Muslim Rohingya minority a genocide, and says Facebook has done little to tackle hate speech. Analysis by BuzzFeed News sheds new light on Facebook's failures.\n\nLawmakers from the home state of Myanmar’s persecuted Rohingya minority regularly posted hateful anti-Muslim content on Facebook and, in some cases, explicitly called for violence, according to an analysis by BuzzFeed News. The posts were made both before and for months after state-led violence displaced 700,000 Rohingya Muslims last year, in what the UN has described as genocide.\n\n\n\nUN investigators published a damning report on Monday calling for a number of senior military figures, including the head of the armed forces, to be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court. Soldiers murdered, tortured, and raped members of the Rohingya minority as part of a “widespread and systematic attack on a civilian population,” according to the report. But the UN report also took Facebook to task, describing it as a “useful instrument for those seeking to spread hate,” adding that the company’s response to concerns about its role had been “slow and ineffective.” It said that the “extent to which Facebook posts and messages have led to real-world discrimination must be independently and thoroughly investigated.” Facebook banned 20 organizations and individuals in Myanmar on Monday, including the head of the armed forces, in an effort to stop “the spread of hate and misinformation.” The company said it was making the move in response to a disinformation campaign it had uncovered that it called “coordinated inauthentic behavior.” But many fear it is too little, too late.\n\nThe UN report took Facebook to task, describing it as a “useful instrument for those seeking to spread hate.”\n\nFacebook once regarded itself as a largely neutral platform for content. But the company has reevaluated this notion amid calls from the UN and other groups to take greater responsibility for what users post — especially calls for violence.\n\n\n\nBuzzFeed News’ analysis shows how widespread the problem of hate speech is on Facebook’s platform. A review of more than 4,000 posts by politicians from the Arakan National Party found that 1 in 10 of the posts — made between March 2017 and February 2018 — contained hate speech as defined by Facebook’s own public community standards. The ANP is the most popular party in Rakhine state, which was home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya before they were expelled last year. It says it represents the interests of the ethnic Rakhines, the dominant group in the state, which is also the home of the Rohingya and other groups.\n\n\n\nPosts by members of Rakhine state’s parliament compared Rohingya to dogs, said Muslim women were too ugly to rape, falsely stated Rohingya torched their own houses for a payout from NGOs, and accused Muslims of seeking to become the dominant group in the state by having too many children. Some even told Muslims to get ready to be killed. Some of the most popular posts identified by BuzzFeed News as hate speech garnered 3,400 reactions or were shared up to 9,500 times. Asked about the posts, Tun Aung Kyaw, general secretary and spokesperson for the ANP, said he had never seen members of the party MPs post about other religions on Facebook, despite the evidence. “As general secretary of the party, I have never seen my party members post hate speech online,” he said. As the crisis worsened last year, the analysis shows that Facebook took no action for months. The platform finally removed many posts earlier this month after BuzzFeed News sent links to a spokesperson.\n\nAs the crisis worsened last year, the analysis shows that Facebook took no action for months.\n\nA recent report by Reuters found more than 1,000 posts, comments, images, and videos attacking Rohingya and other Muslims on Facebook. Beyond Myanmar, Facebook is also facing an onslaught of public pressure over its role in spreading and amplifying dangerous speech in places like Sri Lanka and South Sudan. Facebook’s decision to ban top military officials shows that the company is intent on making Myanmar the centerpiece of a new campaign to tackle hate speech. This is particularly important in parts of the world where a lack of rule of law and deep societal divisions mean racist and abusive language against minority groups can translate into real-world violence. Facebook’s standards ban “violent or dehumanizing speech” against people based on their religion, ethnicity, national origin, race, and other characteristics. Facebook admits that it acted too slowly in the past and has promised to pour more resources into digital literacy campaigns and company personnel to target hate speech in Myanmar. “I do want to say that we know that over the past three years, we’ve taken too long to remove content. It’s important that we acknowledge that,” David Caragliano, content policy manager at Facebook, told BuzzFeed News in July. “We’ve learned from these experiences and not just on the policy side, but on the enforcement side, we are improving our emergency response processes.”\n\nAfp / AFP / Getty Images Anti-Rohingya protesters in front of the local UN office on Aug. 3, 2012.\n\nVictoire Rio, a digital rights researcher in Myanmar, had long noticed that even when posts including hate speech were reported, Facebook’s reaction was not fast enough, particularly given how quickly violence can follow the dissemination of hate speech. Rio raised the issue with Facebook officials last year, she said, and was told the company generally responds within six hours to posts threatening violence when they’re reported through Facebook’s system. “We were told the best way to report things was to go through their internal process,” she said. “We were told this takes an average of six hours, which seemed like an absolute aberration to me.”\n\n\n\nLate last year, she decided to conduct an experiment, systematically reporting dozens of posts that she believed clearly violated Facebook’s standards and evaluating the turnaround time for each report. “What we found was a pretty compelling pattern of 48 hours plus on most reports, which was eight times longer than what they had announced to us,” Rio said. Asked about this experiment, Facebook said posts are often taken down before a user receives a message about whether action has been taken, which could lead to the impression that moderators act more slowly than they actually do. Sara Su, a product manager for the company, told BuzzFeed News that content moderators move faster in cases where there’s a credible threat of violence and usually respond within hours.\n\n\n\nAfter decades of military rule and economic stagnation, much of Myanmar’s population came to smartphones and the internet after 2015, at a time when Facebook was already popular in Asia. User numbers grew at lightning speed, and today the country has between 15 and 20 million monthly active Facebook users. The word “Facebook” has become synonymous with the internet itself in Myanmar.\n\nFacebook removed “18 Facebook accounts, one Instagram account and 52 Facebook Pages,” which it said were followed by “almost 12 million people.”\n\nWhen asked about the results of BuzzFeed News’ analysis, Facebook said it has adapted its policies to changing concerns about hate speech, working with independent organizations that flag fake news, and rumors that may spur violence offline. Company officials say they are taking a more proactive approach to removing hate speech rather than only waiting for posts to be reported by users. In interviews, Facebook officials said part of their plan for Myanmar is to remove profiles that constitute “the worst of the worst” — a step that mirrors its recent decision to remove the US conspiracy site Infowars from its platform (made after other tech platforms, including Apple, did so). On Monday, Facebook removed “18 Facebook accounts, one Instagram account and 52 Facebook Pages,” which it said were followed by “almost 12 million people.” It said that it was “banning 20 individuals and organizations from Facebook in Myanmar — including Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, commander-in-chief of the armed forces,” and the military’s television network. “At a high level, we’ve gotten really aggressive in a way that we weren’t before,” Caragliano told BuzzFeed News in July, before the UN report was published. “We are getting really aggressive at reducing the bad actors and the bad content.” The move is welcome news to researchers and civil society groups that have for years called on Facebook to take a tougher approach. But BuzzFeed News’ analysis shows that the problem is more complicated than simply banning a handful of individuals and groups. Questions remain as to how Facebook can scale its approach to regulating content in a country where hate speech is overwhelmingly common on social media, and enforce its rules without alienating its users or becoming the country’s de facto censor. Last summer, Facebook announced it would remove posts that included the anti-Muslim racial epithet kalar when it is used to attack a person or group. But BuzzFeed News’ analysis shows that hundreds of posts in the sample set used the term in exactly this manner. (The term kalar also has many other uses that have nothing to do with the slur, including in compound words — a fact that sparked a pushback in Myanmar after initial reports that Facebook decided to ban the word altogether.) It did not appear that the simple use of the word — even as a slur — was enough to get Facebook’s content moderators to take the posts down.\n\n\n\nOther posts spread made-up stories, suggesting Rohingya groups were being trained by ISIS or had waged genocide against other groups in Myanmar.\n\nThe analysis also offers a snapshot of anti-Rohingya talking points used by nationalists, some of which seem designed to get past Facebook’s moderators. Often they stop short of explicit calls for violence, but repeatedly state that kalars are “breeding” too many children, or that Rakhine state would be more beautiful without Muslims, likening their presence in the area to an “invasion.” Others compared Rohingya to animals, but in photos and memes rather than text, making them hard to search for. Some of the explicit calls for violence discovered by BuzzFeed News were taken down — albeit months after they were posted — but many posts evaded Facebook’s censors. Still other posts spread made-up stories, suggesting Rohingya groups were being trained by ISIS or had waged genocide against other groups in Myanmar.\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has publicly stated he hopes to move toward automating a substantial part of its content management process using artificial intelligence tools, a statement echoed by company officials in interviews with BuzzFeed News. Local NGOs and activists say it’s tough to imagine machine learning will produce the kind of linguistic and cultural understanding it will take to combat these forms of speech.\n\nNurphoto / Getty Images A Rohingya man looks at Facebook at a makeshift refugee camp after crossing from Myanmar into Bangladesh on Friday, Sept. 8, 2017.\n\nCivil society groups that have been briefed by Facebook say the problem is that the company does not have enough content reviewers who can speak Burmese, the majority language in Myanmar, or the country’s many other minority languages. Facebook says it has 60 people moderating content in Burmese, and that by the end of the year, there will be 100. Mia Garlick, head of Asia Pacific for Facebook, said that the company also has dozens of staff members across many teams who are working on Myanmar. Facebook employment ads show the company is recruiting Dublin-based content reviewers to work on Myanmar.\n\nFacebook discloses next to nothing about its employees’ qualifications or identities.\n\nBut Facebook says its core problem is not a lack of moderators who can speak Burmese, but the fact that users in Myanmar are reporting content at lower rates than other markets. To help remedy this issue, it’s investing in digital literacy campaigns in Myanmar and moving users to a more user-friendly text format. But critics say that the reporting process on Facebook has been clunky, which is the real reason people in Myanmar don’t use it. Facebook also discloses next to nothing about its employees’ qualifications or identities, other than that they are native speakers from Myanmar and the diaspora who are, as Caragliano put it, “immersed in the online ecosystem and real experts.” Considering Facebook’s dominance as a platform for news and information, it’s striking how little people in Myanmar know about the professional backgrounds, viewpoints, and biases of a group of people who essentially act as content censors. In the past, Facebook has depended almost totally on content flagged by users, including government and civil society leaders who have met company officials in real life and flagged content via direct emails or messages. And the platform is still heavily reliant on civil society groups in Myanmar to inform it of problematic content. This process became news earlier this year after a controversial interview with Zuckerberg. At the time, Zuckerberg said Facebook’s own processes ensured it took down quickly circulating messages calling for violence against both Rohingya Muslims and Buddhists. In reality, Rio and other campaigners got Facebook to take action on the messages only after days of pleading with the company. Rio was in the capital city of Naypyidaw when the Zuckerberg interview was published. When she read it, she was about to hop on a six-hour bus ride back to Yangon, where she lived. She was infuriated. She spent the trip texting with other campaigners, drafting an open letter to Zuckerberg that would take him to task for omitting their work. In the end, Zuckerberg replied directly with an apology.\n\n“Facebook is relying on Myanmar’s civil society to do their work for them.”\n\n“Facebook is relying on Myanmar’s civil society to do their work for them. They want to collaborate with us, but they ask us to notify them of these things privately,” said Myat Thu of the NGO Burma Monitor. “When everyone can report easily and it works, that will solve the problem. They say if you found something, please tell us — that’s not problem solving. That doesn’t work.” Hardline groups in Myanmar have already started pushing back against Facebook over its new, tougher line against hate speech. Facebook has no personnel or offices in Myanmar, so it would be tough for extremists in the country to directly target their staff. Reuters reported that Facebook outsourced its hate speech monitoring to the firm Accenture in a venture dubbed Project Honey Badger, which hired its first two Myanmar-language speakers three years ago in Manila. But civil society activists said they’re worried Facebook’s actions could be blamed on them, putting them at risk. Facebook officials said the company is working to make it easier for people in Myanmar to report problematic content more often.\n\n“We want to do everything we can to get on top of and take action on the problematic content, and civil society can help us,” said Caragliano. “The data tells us and we can see that our action rate has significantly increased.”\n\nNurphoto / Getty Images Hundreds of Rohingya people crossing Bangladesh's border as they flee Myanmar, on Sept. 7, 2017.\n\nThe UN report calling for senior military figures to be prosecuted for genocide underscores just how widespread anti-Rohingya sentiment has become in Myanmar, as well as the state’s role in directing and fomenting violence. The report’s criticisms of Facebook reveal how social media has been exploited to spread hate speech, making the problem exponentially worse.\n\nAs Facebook's user base grew in Myanmar, it’s unclear whether the site fully appreciated a notion that is familiar to social scientists and historians: that dehumanizing rhetoric targeting minority ethnic groups and spread through mass media channels can be a catalyst for ethnic cleansing. “I can’t think of a genocide where there hasn’t been a media component,” said Alexa Koenig, executive director of the Human Rights Center at University of California, Berkeley. “There are many social scientists and scholars who have documented the same patterns. As humans, our gut instinct isn’t to perform violence against each other.”\n\nTo human rights scholars, Facebook’s role in the Rohingya crisis carries echoes of the role mass media played in the run-up to other atrocities.",

        "text": "Defiant Republican senators warned Trump administration officials Tuesday they were prepared to block the president’s effort to impose tariffs on Mexican imports, threatening to assemble a veto-proof majority to mount their most direct confrontation with the president since he took office.\n\nDuring a closed-door lunch on Capitol Hill, at least a half-dozen senators spoke in opposition to the tariffs President Trump intends to levy next week in an attempt to force Mexico to limit Central American migration to the United States. No senator spoke in support, according to multiple people present who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.\n\nThe lawmakers told officials from the White House and Justice Department they probably had the Senate votes they needed to take action on the tariffs, even if that meant overriding a veto.\n\n“There is not much support in my conference for tariffs — that’s for sure,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). He said senators hope that negotiations with Mexico will be “fruitful” and that the tariffs will not happen. Most GOP senators strongly oppose tariffs because they view them as taxes on Americans.\n\nThe contentious lunch meeting occurred just hours after Trump, during a news conference in London, reiterated his intention to impose the tariffs next week and said it would be “foolish” for Republican senators to try to stop him.\n\n“Mexico shouldn’t allow millions of people to try and enter our country, and they could stop it very quickly and I think they will,” Trump said at a news conference alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May. “And if they won’t, we’re going to put tariffs on. And every month those tariffs go from 5 percent to 10 percent to 15 percent to 20 and then to 25 percent.”\n\n\n\nMexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, right, speaks at a news conference at the Mexican Embassy in Washington on Tuesday. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nThe escalating tension between Trump and Senate Republicans came on the eve of a critical meeting at the White House on Wednesday between U.S. and Mexican officials, led by Vice President Pence and including an array of top officials from the Mexican government. The goal on the Mexican side is to head off the tariffs — the country sends 80 percent of its exports to the United States and counts it as its top trading partner.\n\nBut Mexican officials have been confused about what precisely the White House is demanding in exchange for the tariffs to be withdrawn, and White House officials will not say exactly what Trump wants. Some White House officials believe the meeting will mark the beginning of earnest negotiations that will pick up in intensity after the tariffs have been in place for a while. But many GOP senators view the imposition of the tariffs as unacceptable, and even as they hoped for a positive outcome from Wednesday’s talks they weighed their options for stopping the levies.\n\nThe exact process for a vote to block the tariffs remained unclear, but the basic scenario arises from the national emergency Trump declared at the southern border earlier this year to get more money for his border wall. Imposition of tariffs on all Mexican goods requires a legal justification, and administration officials say the existing emergency declaration could provide the basis for that, although it’s also possible Trump would declare a new emergency.\n\nBut the law that provides for presidential emergency declarations also allows Congress to vote to overturn them. When Trump declared the border emergency earlier this year, Congress voted to overturn it, but Trump vetoed the measure and Congress failed to override the veto.\n\nThis time, opponents of Trump’s tariffs say they have enough support in the Senate to override a veto. If so, it would be the first successful veto override vote in the Trump presidency and a striking defeat for Trump — even if the House ultimately sustains the president’s veto. A two-thirds vote is required in each chamber to override a veto, and Republicans in the House have shown scant interest in defying the president.\n\n“I think the administration ought to be concerned about another vote of disapproval on another national emergency act, this time trying to implement tariffs. Tariffs are not real popular in the Republican conference,” said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), summarizing what he said he had told the administration officials at Tuesday’s lunch. “This is a different vote.”\n\nAt the lunch, senator after senator rose to confront the administration officials present — Steven Engel of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel and White House deputy counsel Patrick Philbin — according to several officials present in the room or briefed on the lunch who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe it.\n\nSen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) questioned the administration’s legal rationale for levying the tariffs, asking the officials to explain how it could use a law that has never been implemented to impose tariffs — the International Emergency Economic Powers Act — to, in fact, impose tariffs. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) told the officials that they need to stop with the tariffs. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) told them: “I want you to take back that you didn’t hear a single ‘yes’ in this room.”\n\nThe officials assured the senators that they would relay their concerns to the White House but gave them little reason for optimism that Trump would change course, senators said.\n\nAfterward, some Republicans emerged from the lunch convinced that opposition to Trump’s proposed levies on Mexico runs so deep that GOP senators could produce a veto-proof margin on a disapproval resolution.\n\n“I sure do,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said when asked whether he thought there would be at least 20 Republican votes to reject Trump’s tariffs on Mexico — which would constitute a veto-proof margin in combination with Democratic opposition. “There’s just a weariness of tariffs as the only tool in the tool kit that gets used.”\n\nBut senators were uncertain after the lunch about how Trump would proceed if he does impose the tariffs, and his actions will dictate their response.\n\n“You could do this in a number of ways, and I think the White House has to decide,” said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of Senate GOP leadership. “I think you could do this under the original emergency action if you wanted to, or you could do it as a separate action and we could wind up voting on a bunch of these every six months.”\n\nEarlier, at the news conference in London, Trump said talks with Mexico will continue even as he goes forward with the tariffs, which he assured “will take effect next week.”\n\n“It’s more likely the tariffs go on and we’ll probably be talking during the time the tariffs are on,” Trump said.\n\nAs for the GOP talk of voting on a disapproval resolution to block the levies, Trump said: “Oh, I don’t think they will do that. I think if they did it’s foolish.”\n\nHe added: “There’s nothing more important than borders. I’ve had tremendous Republican support.”\n\nTrump shocked U.S. lawmakers and Mexican leaders last week by announcing that he would impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods imported from Mexico on June 10, and then increase the levies each month if Mexico doesn’t crack down on migrants.\n\nGOP lawmakers warned White House officials that the tariffs could imperil the chances of passing an overhaul of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, but Trump has remained undeterred.\n\nTrump’s tone as he addressed reporters in London contrasted with that of Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who said at a news conference in Washington on Tuesday that he thought his country had an 80 percent chance of reaching a deal.\n\nMexico has undertaken a vigorous offensive to avert the U.S. tariffs. Mexico’s economic minister, its agriculture minister and others are meeting with U.S. counterparts, and delegations of Mexican lawmakers and business leaders traveled to Washington to warn against the tariffs.\n\n[Mexican foreign minister says tariffs would have dire consequences, wouldn’t affect immigration policy]\n\nTraditional pro-business Republican groups also have announced strong opposition to the tariffs. Americans for Prosperity, a group backed by the Koch network, sent a letter to congressional leaders on Tuesday calling the proposed tariffs “the largest tax hike in modern history” and saying that “it’s time for Congress to do its job.”\n\n“Given the potential damage to our economy and our national interests, we believe it is time for Congress to reclaim its constitutionally mandated authority to impose tariffs, and to prevent further unilateral tariff increases by the president,” the letter said.\n\nMexican officials have indicated that they are willing to take new steps to restrain the movement of migrants to the U.S. border, although they have not described them publicly.\n\nA Mexican official involved in the negotiations said the Trump administration has not submitted a list of specific actions it wants Mexico to take to avoid triggering the tariffs.\n\nBut Kevin McAleenan, the acting U.S. homeland security secretary, said the United States has conveyed to Mexican officials it wants them to stiffen enforcement and dramatically reduce the number of Central Americans transiting the country en route to the U.S. border.\n\nIn an interview Tuesday with Hill.TV, McAleenan said the United States wants Mexico to harden its border with Guatemala and use the “natural choke points” created by the 125-mile wide Isthmus of Tehuantepec in southern Mexico to screen vehicles and rail cars heading north. He said U.S. officials are also looking for Mexico to act upon intelligence it provides about the activities of criminal smuggling organizations. “We’ve given them all the information we have on the organizations that are moving migrants through Mexico that need to be dismantled,” McAleenan said.\n\nU.S. authorities have detained more than 100,000 migrants along the Mexican border in each of the past two months. Mexico has nearly tripled monthly deportations since the start of the year but is struggling to cope with the rising flow of migrants.\n\nSheridan reported from Mexico City.

        "text": "Congressional Republicans have begun discussing whether they may have to vote to block President Trump’s planned new tariffs on Mexico, potentially igniting a second standoff this year over Trump’s use of executive powers to circumvent Congress, people familiar with the talks said.\n\nThe vote, which would be the GOP’s most dramatic act of defiance since Trump took office, could also have the effect of blocking billions of dollars in border wall funding that the president had announced in February when he declared a national emergency at the southern border, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are private.\n\nTrump’s plans to impose tariffs on Mexico — with which the United States has a free-trade agreement — rely on the president’s declaration of a national emergency at the border. But the law gives Congress the right to override the national emergency determination by passing a resolution of disapproval.\n\nCongress passed such a resolution in March after Trump reallocated the border wall funds, but he vetoed it. Now, as frustration on Capitol Hill grows over Trump’s latest tariff threat, a second vote could potentially command a veto-proof majority to nullify the national emergency, which in turn could undercut both the border-wall effort and the new tariffs.\n\nRepublican lawmakers aren’t eager to be drawn into a conflict with the president. But some feel they might have to take action following a growing consensus within the GOP that these new tariffs would amount to tax increases on American businesses and consumers — something that would represent a profound breach of party orthodoxy. Trump has said he would put in place 5 percent tariffs on all Mexican goods as of June 10, rising by another 5 percent a month until October, unless Mexico stops all illegal migration into the United States.\n\nSome White House officials are aware that lawmakers are considering the tactic, but they have not yet decided how to respond. Trump had hoped that threatening to impose tariffs against Mexican imports would lead to major concessions from the Mexican government. But White House officials have not articulated exactly what they want the Mexican government to do, leading to a growing fear among some lawmakers that the White House will push forward with the tariffs when they are scheduled to take effect on June 10.\n\nOn Monday, lawmakers from both parties, including several top Republicans, warned that Trump was risking the destruction of a pending trade deal with Mexico and Canada by preparing to slap import penalties on Mexican goods.\n\nThe lawmakers urged Trump to abandon the planned tariffs. Otherwise, they said, the pending trade deal known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, will probably fail.\n\n“I think this calls into question our ability to pass the USMCA, much less get it passed by Canada and by Mexico,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) told reporters Monday. “And so we need to put our heads together and try to come up with a solution.”\n\nRepublicans rarely have opposed the president in public in a way that would threaten one of his key agenda items. And the growing opposition by the GOP to the new tariffs marks a potential testing point between the president and his party. To date, Republicans have generally acquiesced as Trump has turned their traditionally pro-free-trade party upside down and imbued it with protectionist tendencies.\n\nWhite House officials remained insistent on Monday that they won’t change course. They argued that the new tariff threat is unrelated to the pending trade deal, and they continued to demand that Mexico stop the flow of migrants into the United States.\n\n“As a sign of good faith, Mexico should immediately stop the flow of people and drugs through their country and to our Southern Border,” Trump wrote on Twitter during a visit to London. “They can do it if they want!”\n\nIf Congress does not approve USMCA — Trump’s proposed successor to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement — he could face an embarrassing setback ahead of the 2020 elections. During his presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to replace the long-standing trade agreement between Canada and Mexico with a better deal.\n\nSome Senate Republicans said they would wait for the results of a major meeting between Mexican trade officials and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday before deciding what to do.\n\nBut GOP lawmakers are growing anxious. “We have a lot of members who are very concerned, I think, about where this is headed,” said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.). Thune added that if the tariff standoff continues, “Congress is going to want to probably be heard from” in terms of trying to limit Trump’s tariff authority.\n\nAside from a resolution of disapproval, other lawmakers have argued that Congress should pass legislation that would claw back tariff authority from the executive branch. Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) has introduced a bill that would require congressional approval before a president imposes tariffs under the auspices of national security, and again on Monday made a case for his legislation.\n\n“As a general matter, I think Congress has shifted and delegated way too much power to the executive branch over decades,” Toomey said. “This is not an observation about Donald Trump. That’s a general thing that Congress has done, and now we’re seeing the consequences of that in ways that nobody expected, nobody anticipated and, frankly, I think, many members of Congress don’t agree with.”\n\nTrump’s surprise announcement last week about new Mexico tariffs stunned lawmakers from both parties, with many worried that it could lead to a spike in costs for U.S. companies and consumers and force Mexican leaders to pull back their support of the pending trade agreement. The United States imports close to $400 billion in goods from Mexico each year, making it a top trading partner.\n\nThe new tariff threat coincided with the administration sending to Capitol Hill a document that is a necessary precursor of a vote on USMCA as the White House pushes for action this summer.\n\nLast year, the White House reached an agreement with the leaders of Mexico and Canada to rework parts of NAFTA, which Trump hailed as a breakthrough for U.S. companies and workers. But the deal can’t be rewritten without approval from Congress, and the White House had run into resistance from congressional Democrats who control the House of Representatives and demanded several changes to the agreement.\n\nOn Monday, House Democrats also warned that unless Trump backs down from his latest tariffs threat, votes would be hard to find if the deal ever does reach the floor.\n\n“What he’s done, I think, is make it more of a chaotic situation, more difficult to get the votes even if we had made the changes, which we haven’t, in the new NAFTA,” said Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.), a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee, predicting that the timetable for a vote on the deal will slip into next year.\n\nAt that point, in the heat of a presidential campaign, many lawmakers think passing a massive trade deal would become all but impossible.\n\nThe prospect of congressional approval appeared to gain some steam when the White House agreed to lift steel and aluminum tariffs against Canada and Mexico several weeks ago, but last week’s tariff threat immediately stopped the momentum.\n\nSince then, Republicans trying to persuade the president behind the scenes with one-on-one phone calls, replicating the strategy they used to talk Trump into ending the steel and aluminum tariffs he imposed on Canada and Mexico last year. Republicans had repeatedly made the case in private to Trump that those tariffs would imperil the prospects of ratifying his new trade deal with those nations, and Trump ultimately lifted those duties last month.\n\nCornyn expressed some hope that Trump still could be persuaded to change course on his latest tariff threat.\n\n“We don’t even know what the president’s ultimately going to do,” Cornyn said. “I know he’s, sometimes in his frustration, expressed his intention to do certain things but after calm reflection and consultation with the members of the Congress has decided maybe to pursue a different course, so that’s what I hope would happen here.”\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) told reporters on Monday that she had spoken to Trump about his tariff threat over the weekend and urged him to back down, but he appeared to be unmoved.\n\n“He’s a tariff guy,” said Ernst, who added that she was “not pleased” about the tariffs.\n\nSensing the danger, the White House started damage control on Monday, though without showing signs of backpedaling. A senior administration official met with Senate Republican communications officials in the morning to help shape messaging on the issue and urge support for the new trade deal, despite the president’s proposal of new tariffs on Mexico, said a congressional aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks.\n\nYet for U.S. lawmakers, Mexican and Canadian officials, and many leaders in the business community, the new tariffs and the proposed trade deal cannot be separated so easily.\n\nJohn Murphy, senior vice president of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that there has been “new momentum” behind the trade deal, especially after Trump recently lifted tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico.\n\n“But this latest tariff threat represents a major new obstacle to approval of USMCA, and the chamber is urging the administration to abandon this threat immediately,” Murphy said.",

        "text": "President Trump, confronted with the latest surge of migration that threatens his tough-on-the-border image, was ready to launch his newest plan — across-the-board tariffs on Mexican goods, likely to wound the healthy economy and trigger protests from parts of his own party.\n\nBut during a Wednesday night huddle inside the Oval Office, Trump was running into a roadblock: his own advisers.\n\nCalling in from his travels in the Middle East, presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner argued against imposing unilateral tariffs, warning that the move could imperil the prospects of ratifying a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, according to officials familiar with the meeting. Kushner, a senior White House adviser, insisted that he could still work directly with Mexico to resolve the burgeoning migration crisis.\n\nIn the Oval Office with Trump, U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer also lobbied against the tariffs, similarly concerned that the drastic threat against the United States’ third-largest trading partner would upend the fragile trade agreement, which still requires Congress’s blessing.\n\nBut Trump was unmoved by the arguments and repeatedly said Mexico had to do more, one person with knowledge of the meeting said. The tariffs, he declared, were going to be announced no matter what.\n\nRoughly 24 hours later, Trump would go public with his latest attempt to stop the migration of Central Americans arriving in record numbers at the southern border, seeking to punish Mexico by gradually increasing tariffs on the entire universe of its goods.\n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders tells reporters that President Trump “didn’t blindside his own party” in threatening new tariffs on Mexico. (Shawn Thew/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nThis account of Trump’s decision to open a new front in his battles over immigration and trade — and the ensuing fallout — is based on interviews with 14 White House officials, lawmakers, congressional aides and others familiar with the issue, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nThe tactic sowed disruption on multiple fronts Friday as top Mexican officials rushed to Washington to defuse the threat, the stock market tumbled on the news and administration officials offered little explanation of how increasing the prices of goods from Mexico would stop illegal immigration at the border, a goal that has eluded multiple administrations.\n\n“He’s trying to solve a humanitarian situation by creating economic chaos,” said Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.), whose state would be devastated in any trade standoff with Mexico. “He doesn’t have a coherent strategy for how to deal with any of this stuff.”\n\nStill, the chorus of objections that enveloped the White House did little to discourage Trump, who was infuriated after more than 1,000 migrants from Central America surrendered early Wednesday to U.S. officials near El Paso. That development — on the same day that former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III delivered an in-person statement on the conclusions of his Russia investigation — marked the largest group of migrants taken into custody by U.S. border authorities in a single event.\n\nOn Friday, Trump defended his threat, insisting that Mexico “has taken advantage of the United States for decades.”\n\n\n\nWhite House adviser Jared Kushner argued against the president’s move to threaten Mexico with tariffs, saying it could jeopardize the new trade deal. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\n“Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S., have for decades, they can easily fix this problem,” Trump tweeted as the pushback from Republican lawmakers and the business lobby continued to pour in. “Time for them to finally do what must be done!”\n\nUnder the White House threat, the United States would implement a 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports starting June 10 if illegal migration hadn’t stopped by then. That figure would rise to a 10 percent tariff on July 1 and then an additional 5 percent on the first day of each month for three months, maxing out at 25 percent on Mexican products until the country “substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory.”\n\nIn public, Trump administration officials sought to defend the plan by pointing to the rising number of asylum seekers arriving at the southern border — a trend that shows no signs of reversing. The Department of Homeland Security projects that the month of May is on track to record the highest number of border apprehensions in more than a dozen years.\n\n“Let me [be] clear, the current situation is risking the lives of children every day,” acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan said, calling for Mexico to take “significant action” to secure its own southern border.\n\nBut privately, top officials were caught in an administration-wide scramble as aides continued to have meetings with Trump on Friday to try to persuade him to reverse course, two officials said.\n\nThe idea of enacting unilateral tariffs against Mexico had surfaced repeatedly in internal discussions — and seriously enough that the White House Counsel’s Office had already written a draft of the plan when Trump brought up the proposal again Wednesday, officials said. White House lawyers had been studying their legal options since Trump threatened to shut down the entire U.S.-Mexico border before backing down.\n\nThe arguments against the tariffs — voiced internally by Kushner, Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — did little to dissuade Trump, and Kushner was asked to call Mexican officials to inform them of the impending threat.\n\nAfter the Wednesday night meeting in the Oval Office, the tariff order was finalized by the White House counsel and the office of Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser and immigration hard-liner who oversees domestic policy.\n\nBut Thursday morning, it was unclear whether Trump would actually follow through, even as he hinted at a “big league” announcement on immigration before leaving Washington for an Air Force Academy address in Colorado. Other White House offices not included in the initial tariff discussions — such as the legislative affairs division and the office of the public liaison — learned as aides came into work Thursday that Trump was considering such an announcement.\n\nBy the time a cadre of senior White House aides assembled for a 4:30 p.m. meeting Thursday, the decision to announce the tariffs was essentially finalized, even though it had appeared to be in flux for much of the day. Trump called in from Air Force One as he returned from Colorado and told the staff that he wanted the announcement put out immediately.\n\nVice President Pence — traveling in Ottawa to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and promote the pending trade agreement — separately phoned congressional Republican leaders to inform them of the imminent announcement. The top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Kevin Brady (Tex.), was told in advance, but Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (Iowa), who leads a powerful panel overseeing trade policy, was not, according to their aides.\n\n“The president didn’t blindside his own party,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Friday. “If Republicans weren’t aware, then they haven’t been paying attention.”\n\nFrom the driveway of the White House, Sanders continued, “Anybody in this country — or frankly, in the world — that says they’re surprised by this has been living under a rock and not paying attention.”\n\nNonetheless, Trump told people around him that he was well aware that many Republican senators would not like the tariff threat. Indeed, White House legislative staffers were flooded with calls Thursday night, although they referred all the inquiries to the counsel’s office, according to two senior White House aides.\n\nThe objections were particularly pointed Friday from proponents of free trade such as Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), but they also flooded in from border-state Republicans who have been reliable Trump allies but also are on the ballot in 2020.\n\n“While I support the president’s intention of stopping unchecked illegal immigration, I do not support these types of tariffs, which will harm our economy and be passed onto Arizona small businesses and families,” Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) said in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) conveyed similar sentiments: “Senator Cornyn supports the President’s commitment to securing our border, but he opposes this across-the-board tariff which will disproportionately hurt Texas.”\n\nHouse Democrats began considering legislative remedies aimed at halting imposition of the tariffs, although one leadership aide said they needed more information from the administration to determine their options.\n\nMick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, and economic staffers fielded a range of calls Friday from business leaders. In response, the White House told corporate officials to put pressure on Mexico, according to a senior administration official.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mexican government scrambled to stave off the looming taxes, announcing that its delegation and U.S. officials will meet in Washington on Wednesday, with the sides led by Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n“Trump loves tariffs. That’s fine, but this needs to end in policy wins,” said Republican donor Dan Eberhart. “The short-term pain needs to produce a long-term gain for America.”",
