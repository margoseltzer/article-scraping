<div><p>New York (CNN Business) When Nick Schwab isn't at his day job, working as a software engineer at Ford, he's building voice apps for Amazon's Alexa voice assistant . It's a part-time gig that's proved quite lucrative.</p><p>In 2016, Schwab was the first third-party developer to create an ambient noise app for Alexa to help people sleep, relax or meditate.</p><p>Now, the 29-year-old rides around in a Tesla Model 3 and has made a down payment on a house in Michigan, thanks to the extra income earned from Amazon's rewards program for top developers and money he's made from his Alexa features.</p><p>Schwab is one of the hundreds of thousands of registered developers creating custom voice apps, which Amazon calls skills, for Alexa on smart speakers like the Echo. Amazon opened the platform up to developers in June 2015, but didn't offer the ability for third parties to monetize skills until May 2018. (Developers decide the list price for their Alexa skills and receive 70% of earnings).</p><p>Skills are like voice-based apps for Alexa, allowing you to use your voice to play music, ask questions or get the weather forecast. Initially,Schwab wanted to use his Echo smart speaker to drown out the barking of his neighbor's noisy dog. Heeventually expanded his tool with new sounds.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">About 300,000 people use his free ambient noise skills every day, and nearly 10,000 pay for a subscription version, which ranges between 99 cents and $1.99 a month. It offers four-hour long sound mixes, such as a blend of rain with ocean sounds. He's also created skills for getting stock prices and finding daily deals online. </p><img class="media__image media__image--responsive" alt="Nick Schwab with his Tesla Model 3.

"Other people come in with a different perspective, and they perhaps are better positioned to see monetization opportunities."</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Steve Rabuchin, VP of Amazon Alexa, told CNN Business the company "factored in" developers from the start.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"We knew we needed to support developers and device makers early on to build these experiences for customers," he said in an email.  "So much innovation stems from our developer community, they're dreaming up and building skills, stories, and experiences we hadn't even thought of."</p><strong> </strong>In February, the company announced anyone can use Alexa Skill Blueprints to create and publish a skill to the Alexa Skills Store without any coding experience required.

This is particularly true for smart speakers without screens.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Amazon has tried to help by having Alexa recommend similar skills or giving recommendations in the accompanying app. Schwab, the developer, said he helps people find his skills by making sure he has relevant keywords in place on the back end so users searching for sleep or relaxation can better find his skill. </p><p></p><ul class="cn cn-list-hierarchical-xs cn--idx-30 cn-zoneAdContainer"></ul><p class="zn-body__paragraph">But Alexa skills are still very much in the early stages, and developers are in a good spot to cash in.  </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"Being an Alexa developer has definitely changed my life," Schwab said. "If you'd asked me two years ago if I'd be at this point today, I probably would have laughed."</p></div>
