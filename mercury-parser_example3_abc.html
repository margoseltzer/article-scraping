    <div class=\"article-copy\">\n<p>\nA change to GEDmatch, a third-party genealogy site that&apos;s helped crack cold cases through user&apos;s DNA, may hinder law enforcement&apos;s ability to use
            the database to catch killers.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, GEDmatch participants will have to upload their personal DNA to the database and manually &quot;opt in&quot; if they want law enforcement to
            have access to their information, co-founder Curtis Rogers told ABC News on Tuesday. Users will no longer be &quot;opted in&quot; automatically.</p>\n<p>\nThis change -- which Rogers calls
            more fair and upfront -- took effect Sunday.\n</p>\n<p>\nRogers acknowledged GEDmatch had received complaints, but declined to discuss the other reasons why the decision was made.\n</p>
        \n\n<p>\n&quot;Ethically, it is a better option,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s the right thing to do.&quot;</p>\n\n<h3>How does GEDmatch work?</h3>\n<p>\nGEDmatch got on the public radar in
            April 2018 after <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/dna-family-members-helped-solved-golden-state-killer/story?id=54800093\">the suspected &quot;Golden State Killer&quot;</a> became the
                first public arrest through the use of the database and a DNA-and-family-tracing technique known as genetic genealogy.\n</p> <p>\n<a
                    href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-women-murdered-decades-ago-finally-find-justice/story?id=61333683\">Through genetic genealogy</a>, an unknown killer&apos;s DNA from a crime
                    scene can be identified through his or her family members, who voluntarily submit their DNA to GEDmatch or another genealogy database. This allows police to create a much larger
                    family tree than using law enforcement databases like the Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS, in which an exact match is needed in most states, according to genealogy expert CeCe
                    Moore.</p> <figure class=\"e_image e_full\" id=\"e_image_63151392\">\n<div class=\"e_full_container\">\n<picture>\n<img

                    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nDirect-to-consumer DNA companies, including AncestryDNA and 23AndMe, do not allow their DNA samples to be searched by authorities, Moore said.\n</p>
                    \n<p>\nThose companies, however, do allow users to download their raw data, Moore said. And third-party genealogy databases like GEDmatch permit people to upload their DNA
                        information, she said, making the samples widely available for searches -- and that&apos;s how genetic genealogists have been cracking these cold cases.\n</p>\n<p>\nSince the
                        arrest of the suspected &quot;Golden State Killer,&quot; over 50 suspects have been identified through the technology, according to Moore.</p>

                                            Nov. 5, 2018.</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nThe young college student was shot dead in her Orlando apartment on Oct. 21, 2001. Though DNA was left
                                        behind at the crime scene, years went by without an arrest.\n</p>
                                    <p>\nIn November 2018, after police say they used the unknown killer&apos;s DNA to trace a family tree through GEDmatch, a suspect was arrested.\n</p>
                                    <p>\nChristine Franke&apos;s mother, Tina Franke, said if users don&apos;t want law enforcement to have access to their DNA, they shouldn&apos;t upload their
                                        information to GEDMatch in the first place.\n</p>
                                    <p>\n&quot;If it wasn&apos;t for this genealogy and the DNA, there would&apos;ve been no way they would&apos;ve caught this man. He&apos;d been under the radar for
                                        17 years,&quot; she said. &quot;I&apos;m thankful [the police] had access to it... I think the police should be able to use it regardless.&quot;\n</p>
                                    <p>\n&quot;It&apos;s going to make our cases a lot harder to solve,&quot; Detective Fields told ABC News of GEDmatch&apos;s new policy. &quot;It&apos;s a shame it
                                        could leave a murderer running on the streets, but I perfectly understand why they&apos;d want to change that.&quot;\n</p>
                                    <p>\n&quot;Everything that we do in law enforcement, we&apos;re always adjusting to new standards and new rules,&quot; he said, &quot;so it&apos;s something that
                                        we&apos;ll just have to adjust to.&quot;</p>\n<p>\nFields also noted that GEDmatch isn&apos;t the only database in the game anymore.\n</p>
                                    <p>\n&quot;GEDmatch was the one that got everything started, but there are other companies that are trying to assist in solving crimes,&quot; he said.\n</p>
                                    <h3>&apos;A setback for justice&apos;?</h3>\n<p>\nMoore, who is the chief genetic genealogist at Parabon -- a lab involved in most of the cases solved through
                                        genetic genealogy -- called GEDmatch&apos;s new &quot;opt in&quot; policy &quot;a tragedy for the families who would have gotten answers and, perhaps, justice
                                        in the coming months.&quot;\n</p>
                                    <p>\n&quot;Further, it is very likely to cost lives,&quot; Moore told ABC News via email Tuesday.\n</p>
                                    <p>\n&quot;It will take a significant amount of time to build the opt-in database to a level that will be able to address the number of cases we were able to last
                                        week and we will never regain some of the data since many in the database are deceased and/or have abandoned accounts,&quot; Moore said. &quot;Whatever one
                                        thinks about this decision, it is inarguable that it is a setback for justice and victims and their families.&quot;\n</p>
                                    <p>\nBut Rogers said he &quot;absolutely&quot; supports law enforcement&apos;s use of GEDmatch &quot;because of the victims and because of their families and the
                                        survivors.&quot;\n</p>
                                    <p>\nHe said he&apos;s received many letters of gratification after GEDmatch was involved in finding suspects in rapes and murders.\n</p>
                                    <p>\n&quot;We&apos;re very anxious to get as many people opting in as possible... as fast as possible,&quot; he said.\n</p>\n</div>
