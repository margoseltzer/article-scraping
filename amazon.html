                            Nick Schwab isn't at his day job, working as a
                            software engineer at Ford, he's building voice
                            apps<strong> </strong>for Amazon's <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/22/technology/alexa-everywhere/index.html" target="_blank">Alexa voice assistant</a>.<strong>
                            </strong>It's a part-time gig that's proved
                            quite lucrative.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>In 2016, Schwab
                        was the first third-party developer to create an <a href="https://invokedapps.com/sleepsounds" target="_blank">ambient noise app</a> for Alexa
                        to help people sleep, relax or meditate. </div>
                    <div>Now,
                        the 29-year-old rides around in a Tesla Model 3 and
                        has made a down payment on a house in Michigan,
                        thanks to the extra income earned from Amazon's <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/rewards" target="_blank">rewards program</a> for top
                        developers and money he's made from his Alexa
                        features. </div>
                    <div>Schwab is one of the hundreds
                        of thousands of registered developers creating
                        custom voice apps, which Amazon calls skills, for
                        Alexa on smart speakers like the Echo. Amazon <a

                        the platform up to
                        developers in June 2015, but didn't offer the
                        ability for third parties to monetize skills until
                        May 2018. (Developers decide the list price for
                        their Alexa skills and receive 70% of earnings).</div>
                    <div>Skills
                        are like voice-based apps for Alexa, allowing you to
                        use your voice to play music, ask questions or get
                        the weather forecast. Initially,<strong> </strong>Schwab
                        wanted to use his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/28/tech/amazon-echo-event/index.html" target="_blank">Echo smart speaker</a> to drown
                        out the barking of his neighbor's noisy dog. He<strong>
                        </strong>eventually expanded his tool with new
                        sounds.</div>
                    <div>
                        <p>About 300,000 people use his
                            free ambient noise skills every day, and nearly
                            10,000 pay for a subscription version, which
                            ranges between 99 cents and $1.99 a month. It
                            offers four-hour long sound mixes, such as a
                            blend of rain with ocean sounds. He's also
                            created skills for getting stock prices and
                            finding daily deals online. </p>

                            makes some Alexa skills itself, it has shifted

                            a move similar to how Apple and Google opened up

                            come in with a different perspective, and they
                            perhaps are better positioned to see

                            the company "factored in" developers from the
                            start.</p>
                        <p>"We knew we needed to support

                            these experiences for customers," he said in an

                        <p>"Amazon is

                            incorporated into their lives," Vernon said.

                        <p>Webb sees it as
                            an effective way to reach a new audience. She's

                            future. </p>
                        <p>"A lot of people have Alexa," she
                            told CNN Business. "I consider it mindful
                            technology. [My skill] can take the guesswork
                            out of looking up daily affirmations or quotes.
                            We all know we need to practice positive
                            thinking."</p>
                        <p>Celebrities are also dabbling
                            in the space. Star chef Gordon Ramsay has a

                            made and he'll spit out a critique for fun. </p>
                        <div>While
                            there are over 90,000 skills<strong> </strong>available
                            on Alexa, from news briefings to quiz games and
                            shopping, discovering what's available on the
                            platform can be a <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/10/news/companies/alexa-amazon-smart-speakers-voice-shopping/index.html" target="_blank">challenge</a> -- and many
                            users stick to the basics. This is particularly
                            true for smart speakers without screens.</div>
                        <p>Amazon
                            has tried to help by having Alexa recommend
                            similar skills or giving recommendations in the
                            accompanying app. Schwab, the developer, said he
                            helps people find his skills by making sure he
                            has relevant keywords in place on the back end
                            so users searching for sleep or relaxation can
                            better find his skill. </p>
                        <p>But Alexa skills
                            are still very much in the early stages, and
                            developers are in a good spot to cash in. </p>
                        <p>"Being
                            an Alexa developer has definitely changed my
                            life," Schwab said. "If you'd asked me two years
                            ago if I'd be at this point today, I probably
                            would have laughed."</p>
