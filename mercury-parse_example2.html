                <p class="zn-body__paragraph speakable"><cite class="el-editorial-source">New York (CNN Business)</cite>When
                    Nick Schwab isn&apos;t at his day job, working as a software
                    engineer at
                    Ford, he&apos;s building voice apps<strong> </strong>for
                    Amazon&apos;s <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/22/technology/alexa-everywhere/index.html">Alexa
                        voice
                        assistant</a>.<strong> </strong>It&apos;s a part-time
                    gig that&apos;s proved quite lucrative.</p>
                <p class="zn-body__paragraph">In 2016, Schwab was the first
                    third-party developer to create an <a href="https://invokedapps.com/sleepsounds">ambient noise
                        app</a> for Alexa to help
                    people sleep, relax or meditate. </p>
                <p class="zn-body__paragraph">Now, the 29-year-old rides around
                    in a Tesla Model 3 and has made a down payment on a house in
                    Michigan, thanks to the extra income earned from
                    Amazon&apos;s <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/rewards">rewards
                        program</a> for top developers and money he&apos;s made
                    from his Alexa features. </p>
                <p class="zn-body__paragraph">Schwab is one of the hundreds of
                    thousands of registered developers creating custom voice
                    apps, which Amazon calls skills, for Alexa on smart speakers
                    like the Echo. Amazon <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/post/Tx205N9U1UD338H/Introducing-the-Alexa-Skills-Kit-Enabling-Developers-to-Create-Entirely-New-Voic">opened</a>
                    the platform up to developers in June 2015, but didn&apos;t
                    offer the ability for third parties to monetize skills until
                    May 2018. (Developers decide the list price for their Alexa
                    skills and receive 70% of earnings).</p>
                <p class="zn-body__paragraph">Skills are like voice-based apps
                    for Alexa, allowing you to use your voice to play music, ask
                    questions or get the weather forecast. Initially,<strong>
                    </strong>Schwab wanted to use his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/28/tech/amazon-echo-event/index.html">Echo
                        smart speaker</a> to drown out the barking of his
                    neighbor&apos;s
                    noisy dog. He<strong> </strong>eventually expanded his tool
                    with new sounds.</p>
                <div class="zn-body__read-all">
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">About 300,000 people use his
                        free ambient noise skills every day, and nearly 10,000
                        pay for a subscription version, which ranges between 99
                        cents and
                        $1.99 a month. It offers four-hour long sound mixes,
                        such as a blend of rain with ocean sounds. He&apos;s
                        also created skills for getting stock prices and finding
                        daily deals
                        online. </p>

                        home and car, those are dreams come true,&quot; Schwab
                        told CNN Business. &quot;I&apos;m an early adopter, but
                        I don&apos;t
                        think it&apos;s too late for other developers to get
                        involved, too.&quot; </p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">Although <span>Amazon</span>
                        <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a href="https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AMZN&amp;source=story_quote_link" class="inlink">AMZN</a></span>)</span> makes
                        some Alexa skills itself, it has shifted the majority of
                        skill-making to third parties &#x2014; a move similar to
                        how
                        Apple and Google opened up their iOS and Android
                        operating systems to developers. </p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">&quot;It&apos;s all about
                        inviting other people to create on your platform, so you
                        don&apos;t have to personally spend time doing that
                        yourself,&quot;
                        said Jack Vernon, an AI and machine learning analyst at
                        ABI Research. &quot;Other people come in with a
                        different perspective, and they perhaps are better
                        positioned to see
                        monetization opportunities.&quot;</p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">Steve Rabuchin, VP of Amazon
                        Alexa, told CNN Business the company &quot;factored
                        in&quot; developers from the start.</p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">&quot;We knew we needed to
                        support developers and device makers early on to build
                        these experiences for customers,&quot; he said in an
                        email. &quot;So
                        much innovation stems from our developer community,
                        they&apos;re dreaming up and building skills, stories,
                        and experiences we hadn&apos;t even thought of.&quot;</p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">But Amazon isn&apos;t only
                        courting developers.<strong> </strong>In February, the
                        company announced anyone can use Alexa Skill Blueprints
                        to create
                        and publish a skill to the Alexa Skills Store without
                        any coding experience required. (<a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/21/technology/alexa-blueprints/index.html">Blueprints</a>
                        have been available since April 2018).</p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">For example, Alexa users can
                        fill out Amazon Blueprints<strong> </strong>online or on
                        the Alexa app<strong> </strong>to schedule and track
                        custom
                        chores at home, make a personal checklist, create a
                        workout routine, or make a checklist for a babysitter.
                    </p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">&quot;Amazon is encouraging
                        people to use Alexa in more meaningful ways, so that the
                        technology is more incorporated into their lives,&quot;
                        Vernon
                        said. &quot;Blueprints is a good way to do it.&quot;</p>

                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">Amazon&apos;s Rabuchin said
                        the company believes the future of AI is in

                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">&quot;We created Alexa Skill
                        Blueprints to reduce barriers and bring voice

                        created using
                        Blueprints ... Alexa is getting smarter, and more
                        relevant and useful for customers.&quot;</p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">A few influencers are
                        experimenting with the platform, too. Koya Webb, a yoga
                        and wellness coach with nearly 1 million followers on
                        Instagram,

                        Both skills are free. </p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">Webb sees it as an effective
                        way to reach a new audience. She&apos;s exploring<strong>
                        </strong>monetizing it in the future. </p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">&quot;A lot of people have
                        Alexa,&quot; she told CNN Business. &quot;I consider it
                        mindful technology. [My skill] can take the guesswork
                        out of
                        looking up daily affirmations or quotes. We all know we
                        need to practice positive thinking.&quot;</p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">Celebrities are also dabbling
                        in the space. Star chef Gordon Ramsay has a skill in
                        which users can tell him what dish they made and
                        he&apos;ll spit
                        out a critique for fun. </p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">While there are over 90,000
                        skills<strong> </strong>available on Alexa, from news
                        briefings to quiz games and shopping, discovering
                        what&apos;s
                        available on the platform can be a <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/10/news/companies/alexa-amazon-smart-speakers-voice-shopping/index.html">challenge</a>
                        -- and many
                        users stick to the basics. This is particularly true for
                        smart speakers without screens.</p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">Amazon has tried to help by
                        having Alexa recommend similar skills or giving
                        recommendations in the accompanying app. Schwab, the
                        developer, said he
                        helps people find his skills by making sure he has
                        relevant keywords in place on the back end so users
                        searching for sleep or relaxation can better find his
                        skill. </p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">But Alexa skills are still
                        very much in the early stages, and developers are in a
                        good spot to cash in. </p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">&quot;Being an Alexa developer
                        has definitely changed my life,&quot; Schwab said.
                        &quot;If you&apos;d asked me two years ago if I&apos;d
                        be at this
                        point today, I probably would have laughed.&quot;</p>
