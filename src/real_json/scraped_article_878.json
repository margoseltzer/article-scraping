        "text": "The Most Anti-Inflammatory Mushroom\nAugust 30th, 2012\nAtherosclerotic plaques may be more aptly described as pimples. These inflamed pockets of pus building up in the lining of our arteries can rupture, cut off our hearts’ blood supply, and kill us. In my 2-min. video  Arterial Acne , I profile a New England Journal of Medicine review that describes the process.\nDeath from heart disease starts with cholesterol infiltrating the lining of the coronary arteries crowning our heart. This triggers an inflammatory response. The inner lining of our artery produces adhesion molecules to snag white blood cells, called monocytes, that zoom past in the blood stream to try to repair some of the havoc cholesterol had wreaked inside the artery wall. Other inflammatory cells are called into action, more pus builds up, and it can end up like a big whitehead sticking out into the blood flow inside the artery. The blood pulsating past can rip off the cap and clot off the entire width of the artery, which can result in a fatal heart attack.\nThe best way to stop this life-threatening cascade is to prevent it in the first place.  As I describe in my 2-min. video  Blocking the First Step of Heart Disease , we can block the buildup of cholesterol by increasing our intake of fiber-containing plant foods and decreasing our intake of trans fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol found in junk food and animal products.\nWhat about blocking the inflammation stage that follows the buildup of cholesterol? Researchers at Arizona State studied the ability of various mushrooms to do just that. They took the lining of a human artery, soaked it overnight with either nothing—the control group—or shitake mushrooms, crimini mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, maitake mushrooms, or plain white button mushrooms. Which mushroom worked best to decrease the expression of adhesion molecules? As I show in my 2-min. video Making Our Arteries Less Sticky the answer is that plain white mushrooms worked the best! The cheapest, most convenient to find mushroom appeared to suppress inflammation the best.\n–Michael Greger, M.D.\nNever Miss an Update\nSubscribe for free and receive a free copy of Dr. Greger's Evidence-Based Eating Guide!\nFirst Name: *\nLast Name:\nLanguage Preference: *\nSpeaking Tour\nCatch up with Dr. Greger at one of his live speaking engagements:\nPin It on Pinterest\n",
