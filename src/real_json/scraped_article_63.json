Bush addressed the march by phone. Last year, Vice President Mike Pence spoke on the main stage at the march. \nMany endearing moments were seen as people from all walks of life, including a huge number of young people and Roman Catholics, enjoyed warmer than usual temperatures at this year's march.\nHere are four memorable moments The Christian Post observed at the March for Life 2018.\nSponsored\n",
