The poll was based on 1,013 telephone interviews carried out from Jan. 15 to 17 and had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\nSome 27 percent of voters were undecided and all 13 candidates were far from the 40 percent minimum needed to win outright in the first round.\nWithout an outright winner, the two best-placed candidates would head to a runoff in early April.\nCastro, who served as security minister in the 1990s, led during the first months of the campaign by promising to tackle corruption and crime. He is running for the small National Integration Party (PIN).\nBut Alvarado's opposition to a January ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which called for the legalization of same-sex marriage, helped him to climb 14 percentage points in one month, according to the survey.\nUnder Costa Rican law, incumbent President Luis Guillermo Solis cannot seek immediate re-election.\nCarlos Alvarado, the candidate from Solis' Citizens' Action Party (PAC), had only 6 percent support amid allegations of corruption against the Solis administration.\nReporting by Enrique Andres Pretel; Editing by Peter Cooney\nSponsored\nMore In World\n",
