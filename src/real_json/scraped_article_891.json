        "text": "Thank You for Your Support\nWe just wrapped up our end-of-year donation drive. As you know, your contributions make NutritionFacts.org possible. Whether you donated or not, I appreciate your support in keeping evidence-based information alive.\n \n \nNew DVD Covers Mammograms + More Coconut Oil & Avocados\nMy new DVD is out today and is  available  as a streaming video so you can start watching it immediately. As you can see below, the main focus is on mammograms. Most women are just told what to do, rather than being given the facts necessary to make a fully informed decision. That’s why I decided to do a deep dive into the topic. All of these videos will eventually be available for free online over the next few months, but if you don’t want to wait, you can watch them all streaming  right now . You can also order it as a physical DVD on DrGreger.org or Amazon . \nHere’s the full list of chapters from the new volume—a preview of what’s to come over the next few months on NutritionFacts.org:\nCoconut Oil and Abdominal Fat\nBenefits of Nutritional Yeast for Cancer\nLead in Calcium Supplements\nMammogram Recommendations: Why the Conflicting Guidelines?\nIs Autism Really on the Rise?\nThe Role of Pesticides and Pollution in Autism\nShould Women Get Mammograms Starting at Age 40?\nDo Mammograms Save Lives?\nDo Mammograms Hurt?\nCan Mammogram Radiation Cause Breast Cancer?\nUnderstanding the Mammogram Paradox\nOvertreatment of Stage 0 Breast Cancer DCIS\nWomen Deserve to Know the Truth About Mammograms\nDo Cell Phones Lower Sperm Counts?\nDoes Laptop Wi-Fi Lower Sperm Counts?\nBreast Cancer and the 5 Year Survival Rate Myth\nWhy Mammograms Don’t Appear to Save Lives\nWhy Patients Aren’t Informed About Mammograms\nThe Pros and Cons of Mammograms\nDining by Traffic Light\nOrder my new DVD at  DrGreger.org/collections/dvds  or Amazon , or as a video download/streaming at  DrGreger.org/collections/\nBecome a Monthly Supporter\nIf you were a regular supporter, you’d already be a mammogram expert by now, having already received a link to the new DVD. New DVDs are released every nine weeks. If you’d like to automatically receive them before they’re even available to the public, please consider becoming a monthly donor.\nAnyone signing up on the  donation page  to become a $25 monthly contributor will receive the next three downloads for free, and anyone signing up as a $50 monthly contributor will get a whole year’s worth of new DVDs (as physical DVDs, downloads, streaming, your choice). If you signed up for physical copies, you should have already received this volume, but if not please email DVDhelp@NutritionFacts.org and we’ll make everything all better.\nLive Q&A January 25th\nEvery month now I do Q&As live from my treadmill, and January 25 is the day.\nFacebook Live: At 7:00 p.m. ET on January 25th go to our  Facebook page  to watch live and ask questions.\nYouTube Live Stream: At 8:00 p.m. ET on January 25th go  here  to watch live and ask even more questions! \nYou can catch all of my past live YouTube Q&As  here  and Faceboook Q&As  here .
