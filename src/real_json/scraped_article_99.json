I am not afraid to tell my story anymore,\" she wrote in a social media post. \"I, too, am one of the many survivors who was sexually abused by Larry Nassar. Please believe me when I say it was a lot harder to first speak those words out loud than it is now to put them on paper.\"\nShe added, \"there are so many reasons that I have been reluctant to share my story, but I know now it is not my fault.\"\nWhile it is unclear whether Biles or her testimony will appear in court this week, she did ask people for privacy as she sorts through the traumatic matter.\n\"As I continue to work through the pain, I kindly ask everyone to respect my privacy,\" she wrote. \"This is a process, and one that I need more time to work through.\"\nBiles and countless other gymnasts have spoken up about being abused by Nassar at the elite sports training center called the Karyolyi ranch in Huntsville, Texas. In her open letter, Biles admitted to feeling apprehensive about returning to the training facility.\n\"It is impossibly difficult to relive these experiences and it breaks my heart even more to think that as I work toward my dream of competing in Tokyo 2020, I will have to continually return to the same training facility where I was abused,\" she revealed. \"After hearing the brave stories of my friends and other survivors, I know that this horrific experience does not define me. I am much more than this.\"\nBiles' teammates Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas have also previously spoken out about being victims of Nassar's actions. This week, Raisman agreed with Biles and said she hopes that no one has to return to the ranch where such traumatic events occurred.\n\"I hope USA Gymnastics listens because they haven't listened to us so far. I hope they listen and I hope they don't make any of the girls go back to the ranch,\" Raisman said on ESPN's \"Outside the Lines\" Â this week. \"No one should have to go back there after so many of us were abused there.\"\nSponsored\nMore In Entertainment\n",
