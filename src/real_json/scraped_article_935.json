        "text": "Noviembre 8th, 2012\nThank you for this fantastic, resourceful website. I’m a bit confused on how much fruit is safe to consume. The study you quote here says it’s healthy but there are other well known Doctors who say one should not consume more than 2 – 3 fruits per day. Apparently it can harm our liver and raise triglycerides? Thanks for clarifying.\nAnswer\nThe only thing I can imagine they’re thinking about is the relationship between rising fructose consumption and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, but the fructose is coming from high fructose corn syrup (mostly from soft drinks) and table sugar, not fruit. See for example  this recent article . Fruit may even have beneficial effects, for example  this study  on prunes and liver function. As far as I can tell, the best available science says that the more fruit the better.\nThe more we study them the more cool things fruit appear able to do!
