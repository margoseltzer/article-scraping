He was about to present publicly his accusation that President Christina Fernandez de Kirchner and her foreign minister, Hector Timerman, conspired to absolve Iran of the 1994 AMIA bombing and lift the Interpol red notices on the accused Iranians.\nAnd it was Nisman’s 2006 request for the arrest of six former senior Iranian officials for the bombing that prompted his push for those red notices. In the context of Argentine political culture, with its long experience of impunity for crimes committed by the powerful, the circumstances of his death have led to a general conviction that the government must have been behind his murder.\nA memorial at the site of the 1994 bombing of the AsociaciÃ³n Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA) where 85 people were killed. (Photo credit: Nbelohlavek)\nBut there is good reason to be cautious about that assumption. Nisman’s case against Kirchner was problematic. The central accusation in his affidavit, made 96 times, according to press accounts, was that Kirchner and Timerman had sought to revoke the Interpol arrest warrants against the former Iranian officials.\nBut Ronald K. Noble, the secretary general of Interpol for 15 years until last November,  denied Nisman’s accusation . Noble declared, “I can say with 100 percent certainty, not a scintilla of doubt, that Foreign Minister Timerman and the Argentine government have been steadfast, persistent and unwavering that the Interpol’s red notices be issued, remain in effect and not be suspend or removed.”\nNoble’s denial raises an obvious question: Why would the Kirchner government, knowing that Nisman’s main claim could be easily refuted, have any reason to kill him on the eve of the presentation of his case?  Why give those seeking to discredit the government’s policy on the AMIA bombing the opportunity to shift the issue from the facts of the case to the presumption of officially sponsored assassination?\nThe Kirchner-Timerman negotiation of an  agreement with Iran in January 2013  for an “international truth commission” on the AMIA bombing would have sent five respected international judicial figures to Iran to question the accused Iranians. That was a way of getting around the Iranian refusal to subject former high-ranking officials to Argentine justice. But Nisman was trying to prove that was an illicit cover-up for a cynical deal with Iran. He  considered it  “a betrayal of the country and his work,” according to his friend, Gustavo Perednik.\nNisman’s “criminal complaint” against Kirchner and Timerman claimed the government’s negotiations with Iran involved a  “sophisticated criminal plan”  to make a deal with one of the Iranians the prosecutor accused of the AMIA bombing, former cultural attachÃ© Mohsen Rabbani. It asserted that Argentina promised Iran that it would lift the Interpol notices on the six Iranian in exchange for an “oil for grains” deal.\nNisman’s accusation was based on snippets of transcripts from  5,000 hours of wiretaps  of conversations of allies of Kirchner government that have now been made public by a judge. One of the excerpts  quotes Rabbani  himself, in a conversation with an ally of Fernandez, as saying:”Iran was Argentina’s main buyer and now it’s buying almost nothing. That could change. Here [in Iran] there are some sectors of the government who’ve told me they are willing to sell oil to Argentina  and also to buy weapons.”\nThe statement proves nothing, however, except that that Rabbani knew some Iranian officials who were interested in oil sales to Argentina. No evidence of Rabbani being involved in negotiating on behalf of Iran is suggested in the Nisman document, and the person at the other end of the line was not an Argentine official. So the conversation did not involve anyone who even had direct knowledge of the actual negotiations between the governments of Iran and Argentina.\nThe same thing applies to the other individuals who have been identified as speaking on the wiretaps in favor of such a deal. Those individuals are friendly with officials of the Kirchner government and friendly with Iran, but the actual negotiations were carried out by senior officials of the foreign ministries of Iran and Argentina, not by private individuals. The distinction between knowledge and hearsay is a fundamental principle in judicial processes for a very good reason.\nThe presentation of facts or allegations as proof of guilt, even though they proved nothing of the sort, was also a pattern that permeated Nisman’s 2006  “Request for Arrests” in the 1994 AMIA bombing .  Contrary to the general reverence in the news media for his indictment of senior Iranian officials for their alleged responsibility for the bombing, his case was built on a massive accumulation of highly dubious and misleading claims, from the “irrefutable evidence” of Rabbani’s participation in planning to the identification of the alleged suicide car bomber.\nThis writer’s  investigation of the case  over several months, which included interviews with U.S. diplomats who had served in the Embassy in Buenos Aires in the years following the AMIA bombing as well as with the FBI official detailed to work on the case in 1996-97, concluded that the Argentine investigators never found any evidence of Iranian involvement.\nNisman asserted that the highest Iranian officials had decided to carry out the bombing at a meeting on Aug. 12 or 14, 1993, primarily on the  testimony of four officials of the Mujahedeen E-Khalq  (MEK), the Iranian exile terrorist group that was openly dedicated to the overthrow of the Iranian regime. The four MEK officials claimed to know the precise place, date and time and the three-point agenda of the meeting.\nWhen U.S. Ambassador Anthony Wayne, meeting with Nisman in November 2006, asked him about Argentine press reports that had criticized the document for using the testimony of “unreliable witnesses,” Nisman responded,  according to the Embassy reporting cable , that several of the witnesses were “former senior Iraqi [sic] officials, e.g. Bani Sadr, with direct knowledge of events surrounding the conception of the attacks.”\nNisman’s suggestion that former Iranian president Abolhassen Banisadr had “direct knowledge” related to the AMIA bombings was a stunningly brazen falsehood. Banisadr had been impeached by the Iranian legislature in June 1981 and had fled to Paris the following month  13 years before the bombing.\nNisman also cited the testimony of Abolghassem Mesbahi, who called himself a “defector” from the Iranian intelligence service, that Iranian officials had made such a decision sometime in August 1993. But Mesbahi was known by U.S. intelligence analysts as a  “serial fabricator” , who had also told an obviously false story about Iranian involvement in the 9/11 attacks.\nNisman failed to mention, moreover, that Mesbahi had given  a secret 100-page deposition  to Argentine investigators in 2000 in Mexico in which  he had claimed  the planning for the attack had begun in 1992.\nNisman’s was so convinced of Iran’s guilt that he was ready to see almost any fact as supporting evidence, even when there was an obvious reason for doubting its relevance.  For example, he cited Rabbani’s shopping for a van “similar to the one that exploded in front of the AMIA building a few months later.”\nIn fact, however,  as I reported in 2008 , the Argentine investigation files include the original intelligence report on the surveillance of Rabbani showing that Rabbani’s visit to the car dealer was not “a few months” before the bombing, but a full 15 months earlier.\nDespite the Argentine intelligence following Rabbani’s every move and tapping his telephones for all those months, Nisman cites nothing indicating that Rabbani did anything indicating his involvement in preparations for a terror bombing.\nThe FBI official who assisted the investigation  told me in a November 2007 interview  that the use of phone metadata to suggest that Rabbani was in touch with an “operational group” nothing but “speculation,” and said that neither he nor officials in Washington had taken it seriously as evidence of Rabbani’s involvement.\nThe fact that Nisman’s two indictments related to Iran and AMIA were extremely tendentious obviously does not dispose of the question of who killed him. But whatever the reason for his being killed, it wasn’t because he had revealed irrefutable truths about AMIA and Argentine government policy.\nGareth Porter is an independent investigative journalist and historian writing on US national security policy.  His latest book, Manufactured Crisis: The Untold Story of the Iran Nuclear Scare, was published in February 2014. [This story appeared first at Middle East Eye.]\nFebruary 10, 2015 at 09:59\nGareth Porter would have slowed any rush to judgment if he had added the two bombing attempts shortly thereafter in London, at the Israeli Embassy and Balfour House, to get Britain behind the anti-Islamic crusade.\nAnnie Machon showed in her book, Spies, Lies & Whistleblowers, that the Mossad was behind all these bombings – what it tried to correct by that ‘false flag’, fake bombing of its Embassy in Montevideo a few months ago, a generation later!\nObvious the spooks think we will swallow any bits they provide!\nZachary Smith\nFebruary 7, 2015 at 19:43\nI’d never done more than look at the headlines about Alberto Nismanâ€™s recent murder, so this was an interesting essay to read.\nFirst impression: Mr. Nesman was a loose cannon, and his activities were troubling somebody enough that they killed him.    Who might that be?   My initial guess had Israel doing the deed to point the finger at Iran.  After all, Iran is again in the news, and Israel wants to paint that nation as totally outlaw.\nSecond guess – whoever it was who bombed the Israeli embassy and cultural center many years ago.   After a very brief reading up on the subject, I wonder why Iran and Hezbollah are the only ones mentioned.   Argentina has had a very active far-rightwing party for a long time.  Recall how that nation didn’t declare war on Nazi Germany until the most severe arm-twisting by the US, and only then a whole 5 weeks before the end of WW2 in Europe.   Remember how that nation was one of the main end-points of the infamous “rat-lines” engineered by the WW2-era Vatican to save the Good Catholic Nazis.   Adolph Eichmann was among that throng, and they all were all well cared for by the native nazis.\nIMO the Argentine Nazis are more likely to have engineered the bombings – Jews are Jews, dammit!   It was just convenient back then – as it is now – to blame the incredibly violent religion of Islam.    Besides, the Nazis are presently being rehabilitated.   Witness all the posts on this forum about poor Hitler and his misunderstood National Socialist Party.    Consider how the Ukrainian Nazis are among our best new friends in Europe, and how BHO is apparently going to send US troops to train them and US weapons to supply them.   Since Saddam is dead, Putin is now the face of pure evil.\nOnce again, either Israel or the local Nazis murdered the prosecutor, and Lord Only Knows who did the bombings.    But without a whole lot of evidence which doesn’t seem to exist, blaming it on Iran makes no sense to me at all.\nJay\nComments are closed.\nBecome a Consortium News member!\nMake your tax-deductible donation by clicking  here.\nSUBSCRIBE  to Our Free Email News\nSign up for regular email updates\nFirst Name:\nLast Name:\nIn Memoriam Robert Parry (1949-2018)\nBooks by Robert Parry\n",
