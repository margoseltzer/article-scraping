The pipeline was rerouted from near Bismarck so if the pipeline breaks it would not endanger the water supply of the capital city of the state. But it was relocated to where it will cross the Missouri River and will jeopardize the water supply of the Native Americans and all Americans living in southern North Dakota and downstream of the Missouri River.\nSecurity forces protecting the Dakota Access pipeline construction spray protesters with pepper spray. (Photo by Tim Yakaitis)\nOn Thursday, the digging took a more confrontational turn. The huge digging equipment arrived to cut across State Highway 1806 at a spot where water protectors had set up a front-line camp several months ago, one mile north of the main encampment of over 1,000 people.  As the equipment arrived, the “water protectors” blocked the highway.\nIn a dangerous incident, an armed private security guard of DAPL came onto the camp and was chased off into the water abutting the camp by water protectors. After a lengthy standoff, tribal agency police arrived and arrested the security guard. Water protectors set his security vehicle on fire.\nOn Friday more than 100 local and state police and North Dakota National Guard arrested over 140 people who blocked the highway attempting to stop the destruction of the land. Police in riot gear with automatic rifles lined up across a highway, with multiple MRAPs (mine-resistant ambush protected military vehicles), a sound cannon that can immobilize persons nearby, Humvees driven by National Guardsmen, an armored police truck and a bulldozer.\nPolice used mace, pepper spray, tear gas and flash-bang grenades and bean-bag rounds against Native Americans who lined up on the highway.   Police reportedly shot rubber bullets at their horses and wounded one rider and his horse.\nAs this police mayhem was unfolding, a small herd of buffalo stampeded across a nearby field, a strong symbolic signal to the water protectors who erupted in cheers and shouts, leaving law enforcement officials wondering what was happening.\n \nThe legality of the use by the State of North Dakota of its National Guard for the protests has been questioned strongly. National Guardsmen have been operating checkpoints to control entrance into the area and later were reportedly used to go house to house to talk to citizens about the protests — clearly law enforcement functions, not responsibilities of a military organization.\nSupporters of the water protectors come from all over the United States. One grandmother arrived with cooking equipment and food, purchased with her social security check. Her granddaughter who helps her keep track of her finances, called her and said, “Granny, you have only $9 left in your bank account.” She responded, “Yes, and I going to use it today to buy more food to cook for these good people who are trying to save our water and our culture.”\nAnn Wright served 29 years in the US Army/Army Reserve and retired as a Colonel. She also was a U.S. diplomat for 16 years.  She resigned in March 2003 in opposition to the Iraq war.\nTJM\nOctober 30, 2016 at 18:52\nIs this part of Obama’s new push to stop global warming?\nWhy is it anytime the stuffed shirts can actually do something that is real and takes on the causes of the problem, they acquiesce to power.\nJ'hon Doe II\njaycee — “According to the reasoning of the current national security establishment, vicious attacks on peaceful protesters must necessarily make the authorities illegitimate and justifies their removal.\nWhy waste that emotion with an attack on a lame duck “chief of state”? – one whose presiding powers were reduced to nothing under a stultifying conservative congress that was so pissing bigoted that they Open The Door to the self-indulgent narcissist Mr. Trump. ( I refer to him as Mister in deference to those powerful militiamen, with all their surveillance powers, multitudes of ammunition and willing stooges – the rigged election scheme and a Blue-Lives-Matter back-up force, is the stage  being set for a modern day coup’d etat in America? The 2nd one in this new millennium?  An arrogation of gov’t Power?\nWhy not stand up with assertive passion for “liberty” and “justice” for all?\nZachary Smith\nHeadline: Why Dakota Is the New Keystone\nOriginally, the pipeline was supposed to cross the Missouri just north of Bismarck, until people pointed out that a leak there would threaten the drinking water supply for North Dakota’s second biggest city. The solution, in keeping with American history, was obvious: make the crossing instead just above the Standing Rock reservation, where the poverty rate is nearly three times the national average. This has been like watching the start of another Flint, Mich., except with a chance to stop it.\nJohn\nOctober 30, 2016 at 14:09\nThank you Ann, and all of the others out  there doing what is right…\nIt is sickening that we have national guard going full force on unarmed protestors, on the same day that heavily armed  goons who took over a wildlife refuge were acquitted…\nFood for thought from the Sputnik International site.\nMore than 100 Native Americans were arrested October 27 for protesting against the Dakota Access pipeline, while on the same day Ammon Bundy and other (white) members of a right-wing militia were acquitted of all charges related to their 41-day armed occupation of federal land in Oregon earlier this year.\nOctober 29, 2016 at 21:26\nIf activists, to include myself had just 1% of the fire in our bellies like Ann Wright, the USA and the world would be a safe and healthy place to raise our children.\nOctober 29, 2016 at 18:23\nTho not at Standing Rock I send my prayers and  good will to our brave native peoples and brave supporters of the effort to Protect our water. We watch the news and pray for your safety. Wopila!  Signed; Pejuta Win\njaycee\nOctober 29, 2016 at 18:20\nAccording to the reasoning of the current national security establishment, vicious attacks on peaceful protesters must necessarily make the authorities illegitimate and justifies their removal. According to these theories – as applied in Ukraine, Libya, Syria, and Venezuela – regime change backed by outside powers is now an operable concept. Not that this is going to happen, or should happen, but just saying.\nPatrick\nOctober 29, 2016 at 18:17\nThanks Ann.  I like what you are doing.  I am a carpenter in California; I want to support the Indians over there.  I am tempted to call in sick this coming week and fly there.  With enough people there, they might be able to do this thing.  We are trashing the planet.\nBill Bodden\nOctober 29, 2016 at 16:56\nI also counted 24 police cars returning to Bismarck at shift change around 3 p.m., a huge number of state law enforcement personnel and vehicles dedicated to protection of corporate business, instead of the rights of citizens.\nFor most of their history the role of law enforcement has been to protect the assets of the Establishment whether it is national, state or local.  If necessary, law enforcement has often acted as the Establishment’s good squad clobbering anyone so impertinent as to object to being downtrodden.\nIt is ironic that labor, often on the receiving end of Establishment brutality, is now aligned with the oppressors.  But that is how the capitalist system works.\nevelync\nOctober 29, 2016 at 15:43\nThank you, Ann, for resigning the night you found out the George W Bush Administration launched their “preventive” and illegal war on Iraq and for supporting the protectors fighting to protect their land and water in ND!\nThank you for this report.\nYou’re the best!\nBecome a Consortium News member!\nMake your tax-deductible donation by clicking  here.\nSUBSCRIBE  to Our Free Email News\nSign up for regular email updates\nFirst Name:\nLast Name:\nIn Memoriam Robert Parry (1949-2018)\nBooks by Robert Parry\n",
