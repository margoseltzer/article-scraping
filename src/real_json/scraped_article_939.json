        "text": "Noviembre 8th, 2012\nFor vegans who don’t eat yogurt, what is a good source for probiotics? Probably not Kimchi, as you noted its harmful effects in another video!\nAnswer:\nCommercial yogurt of any kind (soy, rice, cow, or coconut) is an insufficient source of the level of probiotic bacteria found effective in treating diarrheal illnesses, inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. Yeah, kimchi may not be a good idea .\nA plant-based diet appears to  naturally modulate  one’s gut flora. See, for example, my videos  Boosting Good Bacteria in the Colon Without Probiotics and  Tipping Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes . If, however, you need to bring out the big guns for therapeutic usage or to repopulate your gut after a round of antibiotics, allow me to refer you to the advice of one of my medical mentors, Dr. Michael Klaper, who has some great  probiotic tips and insight .\nImage credit: Veganbaking.net / Flickr\nTour de conferencias\nPonte al día con el Dr. Greger en sus conferencias en vivo\nPin It en Pinterest\n",
