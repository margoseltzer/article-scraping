Order on my website or through Amazon (all proceeds go to the 501c3 nonprofit charity that keeps NutritionFacts.org thriving). It can also be ordered as a video download .\nThe current batch of videos from volume 17 on NutritionFacts.org just ran out, so starting this month and running through June, I’ll be rolling out the videos from this new DVD, volume 18. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak-preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share them as gifts, but there is nothing on the DVDs that won’t eventually end up free online at NutritionFacts.org. If you’d like the works—40 hours of video—I have a special on my complete DVD collection .\nHere’s the list of chapters from the new volume 18 DVD — a preview of what’s to come over the next few months on NutritionFacts.org:\nBlood Type Diet Debunked\nWhy Do We Age?\nCalifornia Children Are Contaminated\nTaxpayer Subsidies for Unhealthy Foods\nPreventing Asthma with Fruits and Vegetables\nTreating Asthma with Fruits and Vegetables\nTreating Asthma with Plants vs. Supplements?\nTreating Asthma and Eczema with Plant-Based Diets\nCholesterol Feeds Breast Cancer Cells\nStatin Cholesterol Drugs and Invasive Breast Cancer\nCancer Risk from French Fries\nFish and Diabetes\nDiabetes and Dioxins\nWalnuts and Artery Function\nDebunking Egg Industry Myths\nEggs and Arterial Function\nAppropriating Plant Defenses\nXenohormesis – What Doesn’t Kill Plants May Make Us Stronger\nPlants as Intellectual Property – Patently Wrong?\nMagic Bullets vs. Promiscuous Plants\nFruits, Veggies, and Longevity – How Many Minutes Per Mouthful?\n \n \nDVD Subscription\nIf you were a regular supporter, you could be watching the new DVD right now! I come out with brand new DVDs every nine weeks. If you’d like to automatically receive them before they’re available to the public, please consider becoming a monthly donor.\nAnyone signing up on the donation page to become a $15 monthly contributor will receive the next three DVDs for free (as physical DVDs, downloads, or both–your choice), and anyone signing up as a $25 monthly contributor will get a whole year’s worth of new DVDs. If you’re already signed up and didn’t receive your volume 18 yet, please email Tommasina at Tommasina@NutritionFacts.org and she’ll make everything all better.\nNew Hires\nAfter running more than 500 applicants through a gauntlet of tests and trials, we now have three new full-time staff on board, Tommasina Miller on social media, Katie Schloer overseeing logistics, and Elizabeth Tov as Keynote specialist, along with six new part-time researchers! Please join me in welcoming everyone to the NutritionFacts.org dream team.\nThis does put us over our projected budget for the year, but with so much new talent on board I’m hoping we’ll be able to grow the audience sufficient to make up the difference. NutritionFacts.org now exists solely on donations from viewers like you. Everything on the website is and always will be free for all, for all time. We refuse to accept ad revenue or corporate sponsorships to retain our independence. If you value the public service NutritionFacts.org provides and would like to do your share and chip in, you can make a tax-deductible donation using a credit card , through Paypal , or by sending a check made out to “NutritionFacts.org” P.O. Box 11400 Takoma Park, MD 20913.\nNew Way to Support\nOnline retail giant Amazon.com has a new program called AmazonSmile, in which they donate a small percent of purchases to a charitable organization of your choice. If you click on http://smile.amazon.com/ch/05-0559626 you can direct their donations to NutritionFacts.org. If you do shop through Amazon, please consider having them support our work by clicking on that link every time you shop.\nSpeaking Tour\nAs you can see on my list of speaking dates , I’ve cut my travel schedule in half this year so I can concentrate on research. I can’t wait to share my findings, but alas it will be more online than in person this year. In 2015, though, I’m presenting on two wellness cruises–how fun! One with Victoria Moran and Dr. Will Tuttle leaving from New York City in February and one with Drs. T. Colin Campbell and Neal Barnard leaving from Miami in March. I hope you can join me at sea!\nMay your springtime be a season of renewal and farmer’s market deliciousness,\n-Michael Greger, M.D.\nNever Miss an Update\nSubscribe for free and receive a free copy of Dr. Greger's Evidence-Based Eating Guide!\nFirst Name: *\nLast Name:\nLanguage Preference: *\nSpeaking Tour\nCatch up with Dr. Greger at one of his live speaking engagements:\nPin It on Pinterest\n",
