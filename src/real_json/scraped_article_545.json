Regarding the \"czars\" claim, the White House responded that \"many of those who have been called 'czars' have in fact been confirmed by the U.S. Senate as prescribed by federal law, and others hold policy jobs that have existed in Administrations stretching back decades.\"\n\"So the short answer is that we won't be calling for the President's impeachment -- and given the fact that you made your appeal to the White House itself, we doubt you were holding your breath waiting for our support,\" wrote the White House.\n\"Here's the important thing, though. Even though this request isn't going to happen, we want you to walk away from this process with knowledge that we're doing our best to listen -- even to our harshest critics.\"\nStephen M's petition is not the only one calling for the impeachment of federal level leaders. One petition, started by \"Gina H\" of Fresno, Calif., on Dec. 26, calls for the impeachment of \"the GOP Congress;\" it has about 3,100 signees. Another, created by \"Gary B\" of Portland, Ore., calls for Senator Diane Feinstein to be impeached; it has over 32,000 signees.\nThe most signed petition on the \"We the People\" site presently is a petition to legally recognize Westboro Baptist Church as a hate group. Though the petition has over 318,000 signatures as of Monday, the White House has not given it an official response.\nRelated Articles\n",
