        "text": "Main menu\nOctober 12, 2013\nBy Robert Parry\nOn Aug. 29, when I published an article entitled “ The Saudi-Israeli Superpower ” describing an emerging odd-couple alliance between those two traditional enemies, the story was met with skepticism in some quarters. But, increasingly, this secret alliance is going public.\nOn Oct. 2, Israel’s Channel 2 TV news reported  that senior Israeli security officials met with a high-level Gulf state counterpart in Jerusalem, believed to be Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the former Saudi ambassador to the United States and now head of Saudi intelligence.\nPrince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi Arabia’s intelligence chief, meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nAnd, a day before that TV report, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted at the new relationship in his United Nations General Assembly speech, which was largely devoted to excoriating Iran over its nuclear program and threatening a unilateral Israeli military strike.\nAmid the bellicosity, Netanyahu dropped in a largely missed clue about the evolving power relationships in the Middle East, saying: “The dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran and the emergence of other threats in our region have led many of our Arab neighbors to recognize, finally recognize, that Israel is not their enemy. And this affords us the opportunity to overcome the historic animosities and build new relationships, new friendships, new hopes.”\nBesides the shared Saudi-Israeli animosity toward Iran, the growing behind-the-scenes collaboration also revolves around mutual interests in supporting the military coup in Egypt that removed the elected Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Morsi and in seeking to overthrow the Assad regime in Syria.\nIn mid-September, Israel’s Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren even embraced the Saudi strategy in Syria when he announced that Israel would prefer to see the Saudi-backed jihadists prevail in Syria over the continuation of the Iran-backed government of President Bashar al-Assad.\n“The greatest danger to Israel is by the strategic arc that extends from Tehran, to Damascus to Beirut. And we saw the Assad regime as the keystone in that arc,” Oren told the Jerusalem Post in an interview . “We always wanted Bashar Assad to go, we always preferred the bad guys who weren’t backed by Iran to the bad guys who were backed by Iran.” He said this was the case even if the other “bad guys” were affiliated with al-Qaeda.\nSaudi Arabia, which follows the ultraconservative Wahhabi form of Sunni Islam, shares Israeli’s strategic view that the Shiite crescent, stretching from Iran through Iraq and Syria to the Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon, must be broken.\nFurther advancing the Saudi-Israeli dÃ©tente is the presence of the worldly Bandar bin Sultan as Saudi Arabia’s new intelligence chief. As the former Saudi ambassador to the United States who worked closely with the neocon administration of George W. Bush, Bandar doesn’t share the crude anti-Semitism and visceral antipathy toward Israel that some earlier Saudi leaders did. He is a savvy player who understands the chess board of global geopolitics.\nComplementary Strengths\nThe emerging Saudi-Israeli alliance also reflects a recognition that the two countries have complementary “soft power” strengths that when combined could create a new superpower in the Middle East and arguably the world. While the Israelis are masters of propaganda and political lobbying (especially in the United States), Saudi Arabia can pull strings through its extraordinary access to oil and money.\nIsrael and Saudi Arabia showed how their new tag-team approach worked when they supported the Egyptian military in its bloody coup against the elected Morsi government in Egypt. While Saudi Arabia assured the coup regime a steady flow of money and oil, the Israelis went to work through their lobby in Washington to insure that President Barack Obama and Congress would not declare the coup a coup and thus trigger a cutoff of U.S. military aid.\nOn another level, Saudi Arabia can tap into its deep well of cash to finance “irregular” forces including al-Qaeda-connected jihadists who can then be deployed to attack regional adversaries, such as Assad in Syria, or even to inflict pain on traditional superpowers.\nAccording to a leaked diplomatic account of a July 31 meeting in Moscow, Bandar informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that Saudi Arabia has strong influence over Chechen extremists who have carried out numerous terrorist attacks against Russian targets and have recently been deployed to fight the Assad government in Syria.\nAmid Bandar’s calls for Russian cooperation with the Saudi position on Syria, Bandar reportedly offered guarantees of protection from Chechen terror attacks on next year’s Winter Olympic Games hosted by Russia in the city of Sochi. “I can give you a guarantee to protect the Winter Olympics in the city of Sochi on the Black Sea next year,” Bandar reportedly said. “The Chechen groups that threaten the security of the games are controlled by us.”\nAccording to this account, Putin responded, “We know that you have supported the Chechen terrorist groups for a decade. And that support, which you have frankly talked about just now, is completely incompatible with the common objectives of fighting global terrorism.”\nSituational Ethics\nOver the years, Bandar has treated the issue of “terrorism” as something of a situational ethic, using the term to disparage political movements disfavored by the Saudi royals while treating violent groups backed by Saudi Arabia as freedom fighters. That rhetorical technique has been well-honed since the days when Saudi Arabia and the Reagan administration poured billions of dollars into the Afghan mujahedeen and their Arab jihadist allies fighting Soviet troops in the 1980s.\nThe anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan brought to prominence Saudi national Osama bin Laden and the terrorists who later consolidated themselves under the global brand, al-Qaeda. In the 1980s, these roving jihadists were hailed as freedom fighters and brave defenders of Islam, but in the 1990s they began targeting the United States with terrorist attacks.\nThen, on Sept. 11, 2001, 19 al-Qaeda operatives 15 identified as Saudi nationals hijacked four U.S. commercial jets and used them to inflict some 3,000 deaths in New York, at the Pentagon and in a field in Pennsylvania. At the time, Bandar was the Saudi ambassador in Washington and so close to the Bush family that he was nicknamed “Bandar Bush.”\nBandar was also very close to the bin Laden family. After the 9/11 attacks, Bandar acknowledged having met Osama bin Laden in the context of bin Laden thanking Bandar for his help financing the Afghan jihad project. “I was not impressed, to be honest with you,” Bandar told CNN’s Larry King about bin Laden. “I thought he was simple and very quiet guy.”\nHowever, immediately after 9/11, Bandar undermined the FBI’s opportunity to learn more about the connections between Osama bin Laden’s relatives and the perpetrators of 9/11 when Bandar arranged for members of the bin Laden family to flee the United States on some of the first planes allowed back into the air after only cursory interviews with FBI investigators.\nThe only segment of the 9/11 Commission’s report to be blacked out was the part dealing with alleged Saudi financing for al-Qaeda.\nBandar’s Mafia-like threat toward the Sochi games a version of “nice Olympics you got here, it’d be a shame if something terrible happened to it” failed to intimidate Putin. Indeed, I was told that Putin’s anger fueled his decision to intervene in the Syrian crisis to head off a threatened U.S. military strike designed to “degrade” the Syrian military.\nThe Saudi-backed rebels had planned to mount an offensive timed with the U.S. bombing in a final drive to topple the Assad regime  and were furious when Russian diplomacy averted the U.S. attack.\nAs the near U.S. intervention in the Syrian civil war shows, the Israeli-Saudi alliance can be problematic to U.S. interests in the Middle East by seeking to limit peaceful options available to President Obama. In yanking Official Washington around, Saudi Arabia and Israel can work different sides of the U.S. influence-peddling street.\nSaudi oil billionaires can reach into both Wall Street boardrooms and the corporate offices of Texas energy giants, while Israel has unparalleled lobbying power with Congress and can deploy its network of neocon propagandists to shape any American foreign policy debate.\nThus, the new Israeli-Saudi alliance can threaten U.S.-Russian strategies for negotiating settlements to Middle East crises. When both Israeli and Saudi leaders say no, it’s hard to fashion an effective strategy for addressing the loss of democracy in Egypt, for instance, or pursuing negotiations to resolve the crises with Syria and Iran.\nThe only possible counterforce strong enough to take on this new Israeli-Saudi powerhouse would be a coordinated and determined effort by the United States and Russia. Thus, the odd-couple bonding of Netanyahu and Bandar might have the ironic consequence of pushing together another odd couple, Barack and Vlad.\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s. You can buy his new book, America’s Stolen Narrative, either in print here or as an e-book (from Amazon and barnesandnoble.com ).

As Mr. Brzezinski stated in his book â€œStrategic Visionâ€; â€œBut Americaâ€™s long standing and generous support for Israel derived more from a genuine sense from moral obligation and less from real strategic congruity, could become less reliableâ€. According to Quran, â€œCurses were pronounced on those among the Children of Israel who rejected Faithâ€ [Quran: 5, 78-79].\nThe Absolute Omnipresent Creator God the Almighty has decreed the existing apparent superiority of America. So it becomes obligatory for America not to be trapped in violating common Divine Laws otherwise the pronounced curses could include America as well. So it is highly recommended to solicit jurist approval from a group of recognized independent Muslim scholars within the Divine Law. Iron dome or iron fist cannot assure security with Almighty Displeasure. With the legitimacy of the Divine Code is the real protection and may give Israelites an open door for returning back to Allah and blend naturally with the neighbors. So it is absolute necessity to get approval from independent committee of Muslim scholars for a lasting peace.\ngregorylkruse\nKind of like Jacob and Esau.\nincontinent reader\nOctober 13, 2013 at 19:49\nSorry, the last portion of the URL of the second article keeps getting truncated.  You can find it Googling the title of the article.\nincontinent reader\nThe URL for the second article, cited above is:\nOctober 13, 2013 at 19:42\nIt has also been reported that the British-Danish security firm, G4S (the second largest employer in the world after Walmart), is retained both by Israel and Saudi Arabia. Its Israeli subsidiary, Hashmira, provides a wide range of security services and equipment at a number of Israeli prisons and interrogation centers, where Palestinian political prisoners, including children, are detained, and also at Israeli military installations and West Bank and Gaza checkpoints.  It is also said to have hired almost 700,000 employees to provide security services for the Saudis through the Saudi subsidiary, al-Majal GS4, for the hajj this year.\nMoney, meet Money.\nF. G. Sanford\nOctober 13, 2013 at 12:22\nIt probably does not help your cause to invoke “plausibility” as an argument against anything you wish to deride. After all, if a low fraud like the Warren Commission Report could be effectively sold to a gullible American public, Holocaust denial might succeed based on the same willingness to digest “plausible” disinformation. What’s good for the goose, and all that…\nHarry\nOctober 12, 2013 at 18:02\nIRAN is very real threat to the Arab and Israeli world.  Iran sends Shiite terrorists to the Gulf peninsula.  Iran tried to assassinate Saudi diplomats in Washington DC.  The USA has been very ineffective in delivering on their promises of NO NUCLEAR IRAN.   Alliances and cooperation occur when needed.\nLD\nSo why go public now? Your last paragraph gives insight:\n1–The jig is up?\n2–WWIII is not optional?\n3–Fake the Russians out?\n4–Maintain existing power structure vis-a-vis oil/gas energy hegemony?\nProbably all 4 actually, but a very deadly chess “game” for most of the planet it is.\n(Sibel Edmonds case has good background on SA-Pak-Turkey AQ alliance. Now if she had only translated Hebrew/Yiddish too ;-) http://nswbc.org/Op%20Ed/Op-ed-Part1-Nov15-06.htm )\nLD\nOctober 12, 2013 at 17:35\nHere’s the Part 2 of Edmonds disclosures, in which there’s a direct tie-in between Turkey and Israeli Lobbying in the US: (I thought there’d be a link in Part 1, but no:) http://nswbc.org/Op%20Ed/Part2-FNL-Nov29-06.htm\nPEScott\nOctober 12, 2013 at 20:33\nPart 1 is included as a link in the article (Part 2).\nKen\nOctober 12, 2013 at 15:57\nVery good article except for the part about the “hijacked planes” on 911.\nI am surprised that such a non mainstream news site would go along with this\n“half baked farce” about 911. Everything else they report is right-on and very well substantiated,and contradicts the mainstream corporate press. Just look at the physical evidence of what happened that day in 2001. There are piles of it.\nIs it that Robert Parry and Consortium News are afraid of someone for reporting and in-depth look at 911?\nNelson Dalton\nOctober 13, 2013 at 18:31\nThere is plenty of Saudi-Israeli alliance that supports the â€œhijacked planesâ€.\nOctober 12, 2013 at 15:54\nExcellent summary Bob.  And your last paragraph is right on the mark and an astute connecting of the dots as you often do so well.\nAhem\nOctober 12, 2013 at 14:38\n“Saudi oil billionaires can reach into both Wall Street boardrooms and the corporate offices of Texas energy giants, while Israel has unparalleled lobbying power with Congress and can deploy its network of neocon propagandists to shape any American foreign policy debate.”\nEveryone on the planet should be deeply concerned about this truth.\nAbby\nOctober 17, 2013 at 00:17\nThe Saudi ruling family will be toppled sooner than it would have, otherwise. This will not be viewed well by their own people.
