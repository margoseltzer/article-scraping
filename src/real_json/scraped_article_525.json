Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Dr. Ben Carson have announced their bids, with more names expected to join them, along with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee who's expected to announce on Tuesday.\nOn the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced her bid and recently received an opponent via Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\nRelated Articles\n",
