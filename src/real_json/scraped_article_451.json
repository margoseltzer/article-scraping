Has He grabbed you by the collar yet? I read an article about that.\"\n\"I feel fingers,\" Carson replied in a one-on-one interview in his home in West Palm Beach, Florida. \"But it's mostly me. I have to be sure, and it's part of my personality that says always look before you leap, but don't leap before you have to,\" he added.\nRead more at http://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-neurosurgeon-ben-carson-says-i-feel-fingers-of-god-prodding-for-presidential-run-130085/\n",
