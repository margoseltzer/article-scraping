Saris said on Wednesday at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Boston.\n\"We don't want to put them on the ship unless someone\" can review their contention that deportation back to Indonesia is \"a really bad situation for them,\" she added, according to The Boston Globe .\nSaris was referencing a case in 1939 when an ocean liner filled with 937 passengers, mostly Jews, left Germany for America, but was turned away by government officials. Hundreds of those Jews were reporedly later killed during the Holocaust.\nSaris has ruled in favor  of the Christians on a number of occasions against the Trump administration, and in November said that immigration officials do not have the right to carry out immediate deportations.\nThe believers fear that they will face persecution, torture, and possibly death if they are sent back home to the world's largest Muslim nation.\nMost of the Indonesians came to the U.S. in the late 1990s and 2000s, fleeing anti-Christian violence. Although many overstayed their visas, U.S. authorities allowed them to stay based on certain conditions, such as checking in regularly.\nThey have been caught up in the net of Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, however, and in August immigration officials told them they only have 30 days to get a plane ticket and depart the country.\nAttorneys for the Christians are arguing that their clients deserve the right to at least challenge the deportation orders, and raise their fears of persecution with the Board of Immigration Appeals.\nThe Justice Department has argued that the Indonesians have not proven that they are likely to face persecution or torture if they are sent back home, however.\n\"Their assertion that 'all face a significant risk of persecution and torture if removed to Indonesia' is unsupported by facts that relate to any specific petitioner,\" DOJ lawyers have said.\nDemocratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who brokered the deal in 2009 that allowed the Christians to stay in seacoast communities in New Hampshire, has insisted that they do face significant religious persecution back home.\n\"Deporting these individuals will needlessly split families and communities, and put lives in danger. I'll continue to make every effort to prevent these deportations so that the Indonesian community can continue to live peacefully in New Hampshire,\" Shaheen said last year.\nMeldy Lumangkun, one Indonesian Christian, told ICE officials  in Manchester that there is also concern for the children.\n\"We are afraid to go home. We fear for the safety of our children,\" Lumangkun explained. \"Here our children can live safely.\"\nFollow Stoyan Zaimov on Facebook: CPSZaimov\nRelated Articles\n",

A 2009 deal brokered by Democratic U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen had allowed them to stay in the country as long as they regularly reported to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office.\nThe ACLU stated that ICE agents recently gave the Christians only two weeks to purchase their plane tickets back to Indonesia and leave the country, however.\nShaheen praised the latest court ruling, insisting that New Hampshire \"should continue to be a sanctuary to the Indonesian community that fled religious persecution.\"\n\"Deporting these individuals will needlessly split families and communities, and put lives in danger. I'll continue to make every effort to prevent these deportations so that the Indonesian community can continue to live peacefully in New Hampshire,\" she declared.\nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, added :\n\"In its rush to deport as many immigrants as possible, ICE is putting families who have lived in the United States peaceably for decades in grave danger of being persecuted or killed. The court was correct to stop this from happening.\"\nA number of Indonesian Christians living in the U.S. have said that they have been detained and told by ICE agents to leave the country.\nEarlier in November Saris sided in another ruling in favor of one of the believers, Terry Rombot, stating that his rights were violated by his detention at ICE.\nRombot had temporarily been allowed to remain in the U.S. under the terms of a 2010 deal with ICE. But in 2015 he was told to prepare to leave the country.\nThen, on Aug. 1 when he appeared for a check-in with ICE, he was told that all people living illegally in the country are subject to deportation  and was arrested.\nHis lawyers argued that a 2015 letter from ICE under former President Barack Obama's administration had promised that he would have a chance to prepare for an \"orderly\" departure.\n\"This is what intent was, that he would be given the opportunity to leave under his own steam and not under shackles,\" Saris stated.\nOther believers have also found themselves in the path of Trump's deportation initiatives, though in a similar case in July a federal judge in Michigan halted the deportation of 1,400 Iraqi nationals.\nFollow Stoyan Zaimov on Facebook: CPSZaimov\nRelated Articles\n",

We fear for the safety of our children,\" Meldy Lumangkun said after an October meeting with ICE officials in Manchester. \"Here our children can live safely.\"\nThe Lumangkuns are among about 2,000 ethnic Chinese Indonesian Christians who fled to New Hampshire to escape rioting in Southeast Asia's biggest economy that killed about 1,000 people in 1998 at the height of Asia's financial crisis.\nThey are also among tens of thousands of illegal immigrants in the United States now facing possible deportation after the Trump administration moved to reopen cases of people who, like the Lumangkuns, had been given a reprieve under past administrations.\nDuring his presidential campaign, Donald Trump said he would purge the country of millions of illegal immigrants. Since he moved into the White House in January, immigration arrests have tripled since the start of the year to an average of 142 people a day, though actual deportations are down from the rate under Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.\nThe Lumangkuns and other Indonesian Christians in New Hampshire say they fear religious discrimination or violence if they return to Indonesia.\nResented for their wide control over trade and business, and suspected of loyalty to China, Indonesian-Chinese have often been the target of racial discrimination in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country. In 1998, rampaging mobs targeted Chinese-owned businesses and in some cases killed and raped Chinese-Indonesians, forcing hundreds to flee the country.\nMost of the Indonesians now facing deportation entered the United States legally, often on tourist visas, but overstayed them. They then failed to apply for asylum within a year of entering the country, a deadline many were unaware of, according to immigrants, as well as advocates and attorneys. They only later tried to seek legal status, and the ones now facing deportation failed.\nUnder the terms of a deal negotiated with ICE in 2012 with the help of U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the group was allowed to remain in the country if they surrendered their passports and appeared for regular check-ins set on varying schedules by ICE.\nBeginning in August, members of the group including the Lumangkuns, were told to prepare to return home, a tougher line that ICE officials said was aligned with an executive order signed by Trump on Jan. 25 overturning many Obama-era immigration policies. Under the new guidelines, while criminals remain the highest priority for deportation, almost anyone in the country illegally is a potential target.\n\"The executive order that President Trump signed in January changed everything,\" said ICE spokesman Shawn Neudauer.\n\"IT'S VERY STRESSFUL\"\nMany of the couples facing deportation have children, said Sandra Pontoh, pastor of the Madbury Maranatha Indonesian Fellowship in Madbury, New Hampshire.\n\"It's very stressful,\" said Jacklyn Lele, 37, who said she fled to the United States in 2006 after her brother was killed in the 1998 violence.\n\"My son does not really want to go over there, he keeps saying 'I'm American,'\" Lele said as the 7-year-old boy restlessly played with a mobile phone.\nThe group is clustered in New Hampshire's seacoast region, where they have found work in small factories and raised families, enjoying life in the quiet, bucolic state. Some serve as church pastors.\n\"They are filling jobs that are important,\" Shaheen, a Democrat who has served in the Senate since 2009, said in a phone interview. \"Replacing them is not easy.\"\nThe local Foster's Daily Democrat newspaper condemned the move to deport the New Hampshire group in an August editorial.\n\"Neighbors who have worked hard and followed the rules shouldn't be kicked out of the country,\" wrote the newspaper's editorial board, which despite the 144-year-old paper's name rarely leans liberal. \"Neighbors who have committed no crime should not suddenly 'disappear' into ICE detention.\"\nThe ethnic Chinese community accounts for less than 5 percent of Indonesia's population, but has raised its profile in recent years and owns many of the country's biggest conglomerates.\nThe governor of Jakarta, a member of the same Chinese-Christian minority in the New Hampshire cases, was jailed for two years in May after being found guilty of blasphemy against Islam. His trial followed mass Islamist-led rallies and sent shockwaves through the secular state whose constitution protects religious freedom and diversity, though 85 percent of its people are Muslim.\nIndonesia has not seen a repeat of violence on the scale of the 1998 rioting, though there have been some forced church closures and isolated attacks on places of worship.\nTWO GROUPS\nUnder the 2012 deal with U.S. immigration authorities, some 69 Indonesians living in New Hampshire were allowed to stay. A similar cluster of 45 Indonesian Christians now live in New Jersey under terms of a similar deal independently negotiated and are also facing deportation.\nICE officials said they had no estimate of how many people could be affected, but 41,854 people nationwide without criminal histories are covered by so-called orders of supervision that require illegal immigrants to check-in regularly with authorities as a condition for staying in the country.\nThe New Hampshire removals have been temporarily halted by a U.S. magistrate judge in Boston, after a lawsuit filed late last month on behalf of 47 of the Indonesian immigrants.\nThe New Hampshire cases have drawn the support of other Democratic elected leaders, including U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan and Representative Carol Shea-Porter.\nShaheen says she believes the group's regular check-ins made them easy to target.\n\"It's totally inconsistent with American values,\" said Shaheen. \"This is a country that was born of people that were fleeing religious persecution.\"\nRelated Articles\n",

        "text": "Nineteen Indonesian immigrants living in New Hampshire received deportation orders Tuesday after checking in at federal immigration offices in Manchester.\nThe immigrants are undocumented, but check in every month with ICE officials.\nMaggie Fogarty, co-director of the New Hampshire program for the American Friends Service Committee, said ICE told the Indonesians to return next month with plane tickets showing a November departure.\nFogarty said immigrants who have been complying with regular check-ins are easy targets for deportation.\n\"ICE has their passports. ICE knows where they live. ICE has all sorts of data on them. So, that's who they're focusing on,\" Fogarty said.\nFogarty says advocates plan to hold another vigil at the federal building Wednesday in response to the deportations.\nTags: \nUpdated at 3:57 p.m. ET\nThe Trump administration Tuesday formally announced it will end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — also called DACA — putting an expiration date on the legal protections granted to roughly 800,000 people known as \"DREAMers,\" who entered the country illegally as children.\nPresident Trump issued a statement, saying, \"I do not favor punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents. But we must also recognize that we are nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws.\"\nPresident Trump’s decision to end the DACA immigration policy could affect nearly 400 people here in New Hampshire.\nRon Abramson, an immigration attorney based in Manchester, says he’s been working with clients protected by DACA in the run up to this decision to explore their options.\nReligious leaders in New Hampshire are holding a vigil outside Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices in an effort to show support for immigrant families at risk of deportation.\nThe vigil takes place from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. Tuesday outside the Norris Cotton Federal Building in Manchester. The leaders of Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish congregations will call upon the agency known as ICE to let immigrants stay and work to keep families together.\n© 2019 New Hampshire Public Radio\n",

But in 2015 he was told to prepare to leave the country.\nThen, on Aug. 1 when he appeared for a check-in with ICE, he was told that all people living illegally in the country are subject to deportation  and was arrested.\nRombot's lawyers argued that the 2015 letter from ICE under the Obama administration had promised that he would have a chance to prepare for an \"orderly\" departure.\n\"This is what intent was, that he would be given the opportunity to leave under his own steam and not under shackles,\" Saris said.\nThe Indonesian Christian expressed his gratitude upon leaving the courtroom in Boston, and said: \"I just want to say thank you to my attorney, my pastor and all of my friends.\"\nHis fate remains, uncertain, however, as the U.S. Attorney's office has said that it is considering an appeal.\nScores of Indonesian Christians in New Hampshire have also spoken out about their concerns over being deported from the U.S., noting that they face persecution back home.\n\"We are afraid to go home. We fear for the safety of our children,\" Meldy Lumangkun said  after an October meeting with ICE officials in Manchester. \"Here our children can live safely.\"\nThe believers are warning they could face religious discrimination if they are sent back to Indonesia, which is the world's largest Muslim nation. Indonesia ranks as the 46th worst nation in the world when it comes to the persecution of Christians, according to Open Doors USA's 2017 World Watch List.\nPresident Trump has explained that the deportation measures are part of tightening security measures in the U.S.\nArrests of illegal immigrants have reportedly tripled since the start of 2017, with an average of 142 people apprehended a day, though Reuters noted that the actual deportations are down from former President Barack Obama's rate.\nChristian leaders like the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez have in the past said that they have received assurances  from the Trump administration that God-fearing undocumented families would not be targeted for deportation.\nThe Rev. Seth Kaper-Dale, a Reformed Church pastor who was a Green Party candidate for New Jersey's 2016 gubernatorial election, has spoken out strongly against the deportation of Indonesians.\nKaper-Dale's Reformed Church of Highland Park provided sanctuary to Indonesian believers for 11 months in 2012–2013 by converting classrooms into bedrooms until the immigrants were granted a \"stay of removal.\"\n\"My greatest concern is they will be sent away from their families here in America,\" the pastor told Asbury Park Press  earlier this year. \"Never use the words 'family values' with me again, Republicans.\"\nFollow Stoyan Zaimov on Facebook: CPSZaimov\nRelated Articles\n",
