WadeÂ and attempt to expose \"Planned Parenthood's shade business practices.\" As the protest will focus on the entire abortion industry, it will try to show any pregnant mothers and fathers attending the concert that there are better options than abortion.\n\"We want to tell women that they deserve better than abortion, better than being forced to go to substandard medical facilities with rusty equipment,\" said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America. \"We want women to know that there are resources for them when facing unplanned pregnancies, and we, the pro-life movement, have always been there and will continue to be there for them as the abortion industry's betrayal continues to happen.\"\n\"To those who lead the abortion industry, all they care about is the bottom line, how much money can they possibly make off of every woman that enters their facility, safety be damned,\" Hawkins added. \"As long as the cash is flowing, the abortion facilities will remain open. This is an industry that thrives on telling women they can't have a career and a child or can't continue their education without aborting their child. That's not empowerment; that's misogyny.\"\nAccording to the All Access website, All Access 2016 concerts are also scheduled for Atlanta, Chicago, Miami and Philadelphia. Local events will also be held so that people can watch live streams of the events.\nFollow Samuel Smith on Twitter: @IamSamSmith Follow Samuel Smith on Facebook: SamuelSmithCP\nRelated Articles\n",
