Which is why Consortiumnews exists.\nFrankly, if the mainstream media had been doing its job in 1995  seriously examining U.S. government wrongdoing, such as the Reagan-Bush administration’s ties to Nicaraguan Contra drug dealers and its secret dealings in the Middle East  there would have been no need for our independent investigative news site.\nAnd, it’s not as if things have improved since the 1990s, with the mainstream media falling for Bush-Cheney lies about Iraq’s WMD last decade and failing to show skepticism when the Obama administration peddles dubious stories about events in Libya, Syria and Ukraine this decade. So, Consortiumnews remains just as necessary today  if not more so  but we need your support.\nJournalist Robert Parry\nSo, please help with a donation to our end-of-year fund drive. You can use a credit card online (we accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover) or you can mail a check to Consortium for Independent Journalism (CIJ); 2200 Wilson Blvd., Suite 102-231; Arlington VA 22201.\nFor readers wanting to use PayPal, you can address contributions to our account, which is named after our e-mail address: “consortnew @ aol.com”. We are also registered with PayPal’s Giving Fund under the name Consortium for Independent Journalism. (Since we are a 501-c-3 non-profit, donations by American taxpayers may be tax-deductible.)\nWe also are offering a choice of thank-you gifts for those who can give $125, $150 or more  or if you set up a recurring monthly donation by credit card or PayPal.\nFor donations of $125 or more, you can receive a signed copy of the new edition of my first book, Fooling America, which was originally published in 1992 and has been out of print for many years. Along with it, we’ll include a CD of a book talk that I gave in Los Angeles, explaining what was then a little understood phenomenon, the corruption of the mainstream media.\nOr for donations of $150 or more, we can send you the DVD of the movie, “Kill the Messenger,” recalling the mainstream media’s betrayal of the late investigative reporter Gary Webb who was punished for his work reviving interest in the Contra-cocaine scandal  plus a CD of Webb and me discussing the topic before a crowd in Santa Monica, California, in 1996.\nIf you wish to get one of the thank-you gifts, just follow up your donation with an e-mail to us at consortnew@aol.com with instructions on where to mail it. We’ll pay the shipping charges.\nTo save you time, we’ll assume that any donations of $125 are for Fooling America and the related CD, and that if you donate $150, you want “Kill the Messenger” and that CD  and we’ll send them to the address attached to your credit card. (Monthly donors can just ask for one of the gift packages.)\nAnother way to help Consortiumnews survive is to buy one of my books Fooling America, Lost History, Secrecy & Privilege or America’s Stolen Narrative through the Web site and we’ll also send you a hard-bound copy of Neck Deep: The Disastrous Presidency of George W. Bush for free. A portion of each sale will go toward the fund drive.\nAgain, thanks for your support and for making our two decades of honest journalism possible.\nRobert Parry is a longtime investigative reporter who broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for the Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s. He founded Consortiumnews.com in 1995 to create an outlet for well-reported journalism that was being squeezed out of an increasingly trivialized U.S. news media.\nUncle Sam's comeuppance\nDecember 15, 2015 at 07:29\nAs the Oligarch’s noose tightens, our once vibrant middle class, first feels the tingling in extremities of fingers and toes. “There’s still a chance you’ll be spared,” said the hangman, as America stood blindly and squarely in the center of the platforms trap door. “Unlikely,” said one American, “they have no intention of ever letting us loose as one by one they hang us until finally the trap will swing for their own selfish good.\nConsortium News and other progressive honest and true “alternative” news providers, documenting their deeds and for telling what it’s all leading to, are the only real hope America has but we haven’t quite figured it out just yet.\nThere’s a revolution coming, the oligarchs have dictated that by the fact that their very own actions will leave free men and women with absolutely no other choice.\nBrothers and sisters of all races and fair minded creeds, let us all unite in our duty to finally realize and maintain our true independence and freedom declared as our destiny so very long ago!\nAbe\nDecember 14, 2015 at 21:08\nâ€œWe are relentlessly independent and that may not make us popular with some people, but I think I.F. Stone would approve.â€ — Robert Parry\nDecember 14, 2015 at 18:47\nI’m retired, so I can only afford $25 at this time.  I wish I could give more.\nI enjoy the articles in Consortium and the comments by other readers.\nKeep up the good work.\nComments are closed.\nBecome a Consortium News member!\nMake your tax-deductible donation by clicking  here.\nSUBSCRIBE  to Our Free Email News\nSign up for regular email updates\nFirst Name:\nLast Name:\nIn Memoriam Robert Parry (1949-2018)\nBooks by Robert Parry\n",
