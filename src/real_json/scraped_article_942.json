        "text": "December 23rd, 2012\ncan you provide a link to the data on potassium levels of various foods?\nAnswer:\nThe new USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference is now out! Our tax dollars hard at work to analyze the nutrient content of more than 8,000 foods. I’m so glad you asked this question, Charlene, because I’m surprised more don’t know about this incredible resource.\nIf you’re looking for the most concentrated sources of any particular nutrient in the new 2012 database,  click here . Then scroll down to potassium and click on  Potassium-Sorted By Nutrient Content  and poof! A list of about a thousand foods ranked from the most concentrated source (2,675mg in each cup of concentrated tomato paste) down to zero in “foods” like lard and hard candies. You can also download the list alphabetically to make it easier to look up your favorite foods. And that’s just the beginning!\nWARNING: browsing the Nutrient Database can be addictive for nutrition geeks–like me! (though if you were a true nutrition geek you’d already be sleeping with the  entire database  under your pillow :).\nSo the next time you see me do a video on fiber, for example, (like  Relieving Yourself of Excess Estrogen ) you can look up to see which foods have the most.\nSee  Fat Burning Via Flavonoids  and wonder where the heck you can find them? They’ve got the  answer .\nWhat foods have the  most sugar ? The most  cholesterol  or the most  vitamin C ? It has it all!\nA consumer friendly version available in PDF form of some of the most common nutrients in some of the most common foods can be downloaded  here . And for more depth you can browse through individual reports on each of the  36 food groups .\nimage credit:  NatalieMaynor  / Flickr\nSpeaking Tour\nCatch up with Dr. Greger at one of his live speaking engagements:\nPin It on Pinterest\n",
