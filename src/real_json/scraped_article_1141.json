        "text": "Main menu\nDecember 20, 2013\nBy Robert Parry\nThe New York Times continues to pump up the case blaming the Syrian government for the Sarin attack outside Damascus on Aug. 21, despite the collapse of its earlier front-page indictment based on the now discredited “vectoring” of two rockets which the Times suggested were launched from an elite Syrian military base.\nThe Times’ “vectoring” argument, which was also pushed by Human Rights Watch in its bid to get the Obama administration to intervene militarily in Syria, has fallen apart for a variety of reasons, including analyses showing that the rockets had much more limited range than the Times assumed; the United Nations’ disclosure that one of the two projectiles struck a building before landing (thus negating the Times’ certainty about its flight path); and the lack of any Sarin or other chemical warfare agents at one of the two sites (leaving only one flight path of a Sarin-laden rocket and thus no intersecting azimuths).\nThe controversial map developed by Human Rights Watch and embraced by the New York Times, supposedly showing the flight paths of two missiles from the Aug. 21 Sarin attack intersecting at a Syrian military base.\nThe Times’ front-page “vectoring” article of Sept. 16, thus, represents another major embarrassment for the so-called newspaper of record, similar to other high-profile errors such as the “aluminum tube” story in 2002 which helped clear the way for the Iraq War and the Times’ dismissive reporting on Contra-cocaine trafficking in the 1980s and 1990s although even the CIA’s inspector general later admitted the scandal’s veracity .\nYet, despite the legs having been knocked out from under its “vectoring” story, the New York Times has made no effort to correct the record or even acknowledge the contrary evidence. Instead on Thursday, it ran another dubious story trying to prop up its case against the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.\nThe new article makes much of the appearance of a chemical called hexamethylenetetramine  or hexamine  in some environmental samples tested by UN inspectors from the Ghouta suburb outside Damascus. Hexamine can be an additive used in the production of Sarin, the deadly nerve gas involved in the Aug. 21 incident, and the Times notes that the Syrian government lists hexamine as a chemical in its stockpile scheduled for destruction.\nBut if you read far enough into the Times’ article, you will find a passing reference to the fact that hexamine “is also commonly found in heating fuel, as well as in conventional explosives.” In other words, the discovery of trace amounts of the chemical really doesn’t prove anything  as much as the Times labors to suggest otherwise.\nThe Times’ treatment of this factoid is reminiscent of its hyping of Iraq’s purchase of “aluminum tubes” as suitable for nuclear centrifuges when the tubes more realistically were acquired for production of conventional artillery, a point which the Times buried deep in that article in 2002 and which turned out later to be the actual explanation.\nNow, the Times spends half a news page hyperventilating about a chemical which “Could Further Implicate Syria in Chemical Attack, Analysts Say,” while barely mentioning the much more common  and arguably much more likely  innocent explanation that hexamine “is also commonly found in heating fuel.”\nTesting All Theories\nStill, since we don’t yet know who was responsible for the hundreds of Sarin-related deaths on Aug. 21, one could understand if the New York Times were laying out every possible scenario and running down every possible lead. But that isn’t what the Times is doing. It only highlights evidence that implicates the Assad regime and ignores or dismisses evidence that goes in other directions.\nSo, while the Times fronted its “vectoring” article and gives half a page to the comments of some analysts about the presence of hexamine, the newspaper leaves out contrary analyses, such as the work of experts computing the maximum range of the crude missiles that supposedly delivered the Sarin on Aug. 21.\nThe “Who Ghouta” Web site in the United Kingdom has offered a much more balanced treatment of the evidence, noting weaknesses in the claims by the various sides in the dispute, but also featuring scientific experiments gauging the maximum range of the two rockets that the Times used in its “vectoring.”\nFor the Times’ (and Human Rights Watch’s) analysis to be feasible, the two rockets would have had to have traveled about 9.5 kilometers for the alleged flight paths to have originated at the military base of the 104th Brigade of the Republican Guard, northwest of Damascus, not far from the Presidential Palace.\nBut the tests showed the rockets had a range of only about 2.5 kilometers. The “Who Ghouta” Web site notes that “the same conclusion was later reached by two experts: Theodore Postol, a Professor at MIT (quoted in the [Seymour] Hersh report ), and Richard [Lloyd], a warhead technology consultant (quoted in the Brown Moses blog ).”\nBut there are other disqualifying problems with the “vectoring” claims. For one, the UN inspectors’ report said one of the two missiles — the one striking Moadamiya, south of Damascus — “initially impacted the corner of the second floor of an adjacent apartment building to the east” before cutting through a trellis and crash landing.\nSo, while the inspectors could compute the angle of the rocket’s final descent, its clipping of the building would make a calculation of its flight path and thus its point of origin highly dubious if not impossible.\nThere is another big problem with the “vectoring” argument: the UN inspectors found no Sarin and no chemical weapons agents in the 13 sample areas inspected in Moadamiya, while they did find substantial evidence of Sarin in the Zamalka/Ein Tarma area, east of Damascus. But you can’t do a vectoring with only one flight path.\nDespite the absence of Sarin and other chemical warfare agents in Moadamiya, victims did show up at the local hospital with symptoms of Sarin poisoning. But the likely explanation  as even the Obama administration’s “Government Assessment” of Aug. 30 suggested  was that victims of the Zalmalka attack spilled over into neighboring areas.\nA footnote contained in a White House-released map on the supposed attack locations read: “Reports of chemical attacks originating from some locations may reflect the movement of patients exposed in one neighborhood to field hospitals and medical facilities in the surrounding area. They may also reflect confusion and panic triggered by the ongoing artillery and rocket barrage, and reports of chemical use in other neighborhoods.”\nThough the Obama administration’s “Government Assessment” pointed the finger of blame for the Sarin attack at the Syrian government, the four-page white paper provided not a single piece of evidence that could be independently evaluated — which has made the Times’ “vectoring” analysis even more important, as the only significant piece of “hard evidence” cited by the Assad-did-it crowd. So, the actual “softness” of that evidence alters the public debate.\nJournalism Standards\nOf course, it may turn out that some element of the Syrian military was responsible for the Sarin attack in the Zamalka area. Or perhaps some extremist wing of the Syrian rebels either botched a chemical attack aimed at government targets or engaged in a provocation on a pro-rebel neighborhood to draw the U.S. military into the war against the Assad regime. Or it conceivably was a tragic mistake, the mishandling of a very dangerous payload.\nBut whatever the eventual answer to the mystery, the New York Times should at least reflect the doubts among many analysts, including some inside the U.S. intelligence community . Instead of stonewalling in defense of its front-page “vectoring” article  much like it did for crucial months in 2002-03 as its “aluminum tube” story contributed to the bloodbath in Iraq  the Times also should acknowledge legitimate questions being raised about the feasibility of its Syria analysis.\nThere are obvious similarities between the Times’ coverage of Iraq and Syria. In both cases, the country was governed by a “designated” Arab villain, Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Both were opposed by the U.S. and Israeli governments and were the targets of neoconservative calls for “regime change.”\nThus, despite the problems with the “vectoring” story, there was very little pushback from authoritative circles that would get the attention of the Times editors. From a career perspective, it was fairly safe to go with the flow of U.S.-Israeli vitriol against the despised leaders. Indeed, some Times editors may see themselves as part of the propaganda apparatus engaged in the worthy goal of getting rid of people like Hussein and Assad.\nBut that is not how journalism is supposed to work. The job of reporters and editors should be to present the American people and the world public with full and fair coverage of important events  and surely the issue of war or peace in the Middle East qualifies.\nThe readers of the New York Times should not have to turn to Internet sites to get a balanced treatment of such a crucial story.\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

But the question is why? Money, Position? Why is mainline journalism not working the way it is supposed to ?\nDecember 29, 2013 at 01:29\nI needÐµd to thank yÎ¿u for this goÎ¿d read!! I certainly loved\nevery little bit of it. I’ve got you saved as a favorite to check out new thÑ–ngs you postâ€¦\nDenis O'Brien\nDecember 23, 2013 at 15:13\nRobert, your objectivity is your strongest asset, as it should be for any reporter.\nBut in this case you (and Sy Hersh) need to expand your pharmacological conclusions beyond the Sarin Myth.  This was not a “sarin attack” at all, although sarin may have been planted or “applied” locally for the PR effect.  But as one trained in neuropharmacology I can assert with absolute confidence that the videos that came out of Ghouta on Aug21 do not show sarin victims.\nOn Sep09.2013 I laid out the biological arguments in an open letter to Congress:\nOne strong logical/technical argument against the Sarin Myth is this:  From the very first YT upload on Aug21 (Damascus time) the insurgent PR agents uploading the vids were claiming a “sarin attack.” By the time people woke up in NYC, “sarin” was an indisputable fact.\nSarin gas is odorless, colorless, tasteless, invisible.  If it had been sarin, no one would have known unless they were the actual perpetrators, or unless they had some serious gas chromatography gear, about 4 days to collect and analyze samples, and a huge budget.  Even the UN Mission’s conclusions were so full of holes they couldn’t stand up to a dormouse’s fart.\nAs of 4 AM Damascus time on Aug21, the only way to deduce the toxin was sarin would be the peculiar spectrum of symptoms oganophosphates produce. As I argue in the paper above, not one of those symptoms is unequivocally seen in a single victim, much less hundreds and hundreds of victims, which would have been the case had the toxin been sarin.  One simply cannot ignore the biological evidence.\nThe psychological problem here is that the alternatives to the Sarin Myth are even more disturbing.  But since Aug21 the world has a much better idea of the barbarity that ISIS, al-Nusra, al-Qadea, et al. Sunni extremists are capable of.  Executing children for photo ops is not beyond them.\ncadizia\nDecember 21, 2013 at 09:56\nAn epidemic of amateur experts.  The  #Hexamine information advanced to the Technical Secretariat by #Syrian Govt. explained what it was for, preparation  #Methylphosphonyl #difluoride , the NYT  article is therefore a very unique theory and quite wrong.  NYT assign Hexamine to the final Sarin step.  It was used in the preceding stage.\nBen Noweizer\nDecember 21, 2013 at 02:01\nAnd U R no better than the NYT!! at least the paper has some positive points to their side meaning they donâ€™t lie for their living as u do. Roberts Who are U and what grade do u hold in the military hierarchy to discuss such details??\nWhat do u get to keep masking a brutal murdered and dictator despite being an agent to Israel & the west? Both Israel & the US have called for Assad as being the best proven deal in the regionâ€¦. You are lost amid Iranian petrodollars to the point of losing your own pathâ€¦ Putting just praised the NSA on their work !! You better redirect your essays on better subject!\nYaj\nBen:\nI don’t usually say this, but: Fix your grammar and spelling.\nYour claims still won’t make any sense, but at least they’ll be sort of coherent if inaccurate.\nYaj\nDecember 20, 2013 at 20:48\nSOMINI SENGUPTA nearly as bad as Judith Miller and Micheal Gordon, the latter still “reporting” for the New York Times.\nThe 2002/03 fiasco at the Times was so bad, that I gave up reading it real seriously–guess I’m glad that Robert Parry reads the Times, but ugh.\nComments are closed.\nBecome a Consortium News member!\nMake your tax-deductible donation by clicking  here.\nSUBSCRIBE  to Our Free Email News\nSign up for regular email updates\nFirst Name:\nLast Name:\nIn Memoriam Robert Parry (1949-2018)\nBooks by Robert Parry\n",
