        "text": "Main menu\nOctober 14, 2016\nBy Robert Parry\nYes, The New York Times is the newspaper of the Establishment and reflexively accepts almost anything that the powers-that-be say is true, but Donald Trump undercuts that valid critique when he spins a conspiracy theory about the Times plotting with women who simply confirm what Trump has said about his own sexual predations.\nIt wasn’t a couple of women who announced Trump’s compulsion to kiss and grope women and rely on his wealth and star power to keep them silent. It was Trump in his “locker room talk” with Access Hollywood host Billy Bush in 2005:\nDonald Trump speaking with supporters at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona. June 18, 2016. (Photo by Gage Skidmore)\n“You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. … Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.”\nAnd, it wasn’t Miss Arizona and a few other beauty pageant contestants who described Trump’s creepy interest in ogling naked teen-age girls in backstage dressing rooms. It was Trump in a radio show with shock jock Howard Stern.\n“I’ll tell you the funniest is that I’ll go backstage before a show and everyone’s getting dressed,” Trump told Stern in recordings of Stern’s show. “No men are anywhere, and I’m allowed to go in, because I’m the owner of the pageant and therefore I’m inspecting it. … ‘Is everyone OK’? You know, they’re standing there with no clothes. ‘Is everybody OK?’ And you see these incredible looking women, and so I sort of get away with things like that.”\nIn other words, Trump does a disservice to anyone who seeks to analyze the actual interplay between the mainstream U.S. media and the politically powerful when he exploits that serious concern by using it to cover up his own unconscionable behavior.\n“I take all of these slings and arrows gladly, for you,” Trump told a cheering crowd in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Thursday. “I take them for our movement, so that we can have our country back. Our great civilization here in America and across the civilized world has come upon a moment of reckoning.”\nYet, Trump is not some innocent martyr for the cause. The simple and obvious truth is that he did what he bluntly described himself doing, forcing himself on unsuspecting women and satisfying his prurient interest in seeing naked women, even girls as young as 15.\nThat he is now attacking the honesty of women who simply confirm what he himself has said about his own behavior is truly bizarre. His recent assertion that his self-admissions were not to be taken seriously – and that thus the confirmations of his own words by a variety of women coming forward – must be false stands as one of the most audacious lies ever told in U.S. politics, which is saying something.\nThis is not a “he said/she said” situation. It is a moment in which “he” confessed to the actions that “she” – or in this case, multiple she’s – is confirming, except now the “he” says he was lying when he made his un-coerced confessions and thus the confirmations must also be a lie.\nSpinning a Conspiracy Theory\nAs bad as that is, Trump has made matters worse by wrapping his self-contradictions about his own actions in the web of a global conspiracy. That means his cover-up also discredits the valid concerns about the real coordination of policies by the wealthy and the political/media elites. Trump’s conspiracy theory is like many other conspiracy theories that divert attention from some genuine wrongdoing by postulating an absurd alternative reality that is easily disproved.\nNew York Times building in New York City. (Photo from Wikipedia)\nIn this case, Trump enables the Times, which does deserve criticism for a long pattern of falling in line behind the falsehoods of the Establishment, to now wrap itself in the cloak of courageous journalism reporting facts that Americans need to know to function as informed citizens in a democracy. With his preposterous threat to sue the Times, Trump gives the Times unearned credibility as the protector of the public interest.\nTrump further undermines his generally accurate contention that the powers-that-be are enriching themselves at the expense of regular people when he surrounds that important point with various right-wing nostrums about slashing taxes on the rich and wiping away regulations that somewhat constrain the actions of big banks and big corporations.\nHow it follows that the way to rein in the abuses of the powerful is to give them more money and freedom to do whatever they want is never explained in Trump’s “populist” appeals.\nTo say that Trump is a flawed messenger for a reasonably valid message about the elites having little concern about the suffering of the commoners is a gross understatement. He is the personification of a rich and powerful individual exercising dominion over vulnerable people who can’t fight back. He is, in a word, a phony. And, if you wanted to add another word, he is a demagogic phony.\nIt is a sad predicament that people who want desperately to challenge the unbridled, corrupt and dangerous power of the global elites find themselves stuck with Donald Trump as their avatar, a person who was happy to hobnob with those elites and share their grotesque control over “lesser” people until he suddenly found “populism” as the way to accumulate even more power.\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s. You can buy his latest book, America’s Stolen Narrative, either in  print here  or as an e-book (from Amazon and barnesandnoble.com ).\ngwynedd1\nOctober 18, 2016 at 12:24\nThe Ottoman empire did not ally themselves with France out of love for them. They did so because they had common enemies. The Byzantines did not take in the Brother of the Sultan because they loved him. They did so because releasing him could cause the Ottomans to go into civil war.  That’s how power brokers think.  The stupid,  populist position is to be fussy over an ally and look for unicorn candidates and Mr Smith going to Washington. . Putin is our ally because Russians have learned the art of freeing the people of an  enemy as the US has done.  If inciting a slave revolt al democracy.\nThe best strategy is to back the weaker of the elites.  Trump is a means to an end that has already won huge dividends. Look like a good lot of you would hesitate at a queen sac on the chess board because she is just worth too much to a patzer.\nAs for Trump , women reporters are in male locker rooms oogling all the time. I am not too impressed with a culture that puts women on a  pedestal while feminism runs amok.  I like to look a beautiful women as well because I like them. And because I like them , I would not even think of harming them.  Perhaps that is not your moral position. However it is my moral position that women in beauty contest want to be looked at. If  he was leering at them or not , who knows, but we have seen far worse than this.\nStop being so naive….We cannot let Hillary take this. Its Trump on his own vs the entire network behind Hillary.Even if Trump were a little devil , the demons that inhabit her go by the name of legion. Trump will have little room to maneuver in an evil manner . We will have to be loyal to his only allies.\nZachary Smith\nWe cannot let Hillary take this.\nIt’s my opinion we cannot stop Hillary now.   The “Fix” is on, and that’s all there is to it.    The Corporate Media is very firm about how US Elections are totally secure and safe – so long as Clinton is winning.   All of us are expected to ignore the same Corporate Media’s howling about the real and scary prospect of evil Russians subverting our 2016 election for their secret agent Trump.\nThe stage is set now, and all that remains is to flip a few hacker switches – if necessary.  Given the way Trump is behaving it probably won’t be necessary.   But if it is, the deed will be done efficiently and without any Corporate Media attention except for possibly a story or two of total dismissal.\nWe’re going to dodge the bullet of the sexual swine Trump, but are instead going to put a slightly different sort of pig into the White House.  One who doesn’t care for what happens to other women any more than does Trump.\nhXXps://alethonews.wordpress.com/2016/10/18/hillarys-hide-and-seek/\n(replace the XX with tt after cut-pasting to the browser window)\nZachary Smith\nOctober 16, 2016 at 21:15\n“Donald Trump’s False Martyrdom”\nI was staring at the thread’s title when it struck me that a better phrase is going to be Donald Trump’s Real Martyrdom\nBack on August 16, a time which somehow seems an eternity ago, there was a headline about Michael Moore’s Trump Conclusion:\nMichael Moore: I Know ‘For a Fact’ Trump Doesn’t Want Presidency\nBut since Trump has an 3XXL ego, he had to duck out of the race in such a way as to keep that ego intact.  I’d propose he has found it with the sex-tape revelation and the scads of women who say he forced himself on them.   Now he can happily continue to the end of the race guaranteed that 1) a substantial part of the population will stand with him, and 2) now he will most certainly lose.    From his point of view it’s a win-win situation.   No doubt in his concession speech – assuming he gives one – he’ll carry on about how he was robbed.   If his True Believers stick by him as long as they did with Bush the Dumber, it’s going to make people around the world start shuddering when they even think about US “democracy”.\nMike Locklear\nOctober 16, 2016 at 15:07\nThis onetime hero of mine has morphed into a hypocrite on the scale of the politicians he revels in publicly scourging.  Goin’ on twelve years ago I assumed this “reformist” “journalist” would be a natural ally in exposing the corrupt Political-Media nexus strangle-holding our “nation” for so long since he publicly deplores the go-along-to-get-along mentality condoning so much wanton and destructive illegality (“1980-gate”, Debacle  2K…).  But this sad has-been (“happy to hobnob with those elites”) has wholly tossed his lot(/credibility) in with John Kerry and the “Democratic” party he feigns to keep an honest eye on.  He’s known for the full course of this horrible twelve year cycle the greatest untold story in American politics:  That one solitary-striving “Mr. Smith” type first singlehandedly convinced Kerry to ignore his high-paid (but feckless as him) strategy-advisors and attack the Bush/Vader administration on their putative “strength” of Iraq and Terrorism before thereafter (while workin’ & writin’ out of D.C.’s CCNV homeless shelter in 2005 & 2006) leadin’ the intellectual charge against that administration straight from the netherworld in monthly blogs continually layin’ bare the many uncommented-upon misdeeds which the “Democrat”ic (patsy-)party were previously too timid to touch.  My non-false martyrdom in the cruel hands of the elite conspiracy Parry’s gladly joined is forever to be a bloody stain on his soul if not yet his undeserved reputation.  A lesser soul suffering such outrageous treatment (such as the ongoing electronic privacy violations brought by my passionate activism) would’ve killed himself by now.  We’ll see how this tragedy unfolds.  A sad predicament indeed…\nEvangelista\nOctober 15, 2016 at 20:37\n“And Now For Something Completely Different.”, to quote from Monty Python.\nBut what?\nHow about some rational analysis?\nWay out of place in an election year…Everyone wants hype, hoot, hoorah, hoopla, hysterical, hyperventilation, hate, “horror-show”, to quote “A Clockwork Orange” (by Anthony Burgess).\n“… … …\n“Billy Bush: Sheesh, your girl’s hot as shit. In the purple.\n“Trump: Whoa! Whoa!\n[Crosstalk]\n[Crosstalk]\n[Silence]\n“Trump: Maybe it’s a different one.\n“Bush: It better not be the publicist. No, it’s, it’s her, it’s —\n“Trump: Yeah, that’s her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\n“Bush: Whatever you want.\n… … …”\nLet’s analyze:  Trump is on the bus, with Billy Bush and others.  He says, “Trump: Look at you, you are a pussy.” The ‘hot’ woman “In the purple.” is outside, out of earshot.  Someone on the bus, Billy Bush, or one of the others, the tech people, is referred to, and the context precluded sexual reference.\nWe move on to Trump.  What does Trump say about Trump?  He says: “You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.”\nIs kissing on the verboten ‘touchings’ list?  If so, Trump has admitted himself a ‘moral corrupt’.  If not, he has said nothing to hyperventilate about.\nWhat does he say next that is relevant?  He says, “when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.”\nWhat is Trump talking about?  Who is he talking about?  Is he confessing anything?  Or is he commenting on others?\nThe answer, for any who are too hysterical to connect, is, he is commenting on women.  Not any women, or all women, he is commenting on star-struck women who will allow “anything”.  Anything, Trump says, including, “Grab ’em by the pussy.”\nIf we put aside all of the hysteria, hyperventilation and stupidity, Trump, in the tape, commented about a category of persons, in his commentary women, but, in life, there are males who do the same, allowing “anything”.\nMr. Parry, and all the others hyperventilating about the NBC tape are not even making a mountain of a molehill, because there is not even a molehill of what is howled as “A Trump Admission!!!” by the raving tabloids and gossips set pretending to be journalists.\nThe hyper-ventilators and hysterics are fabricating from, not zero, from their own prior fabrication assumptions.\nThis article is Consortium News turning into Weekly World News.  Weekly World News is a dead publication.  Let us hope Bob Parry is only ‘resurrecting’ it in phantasmagora for a Halloween Appearance.\nbernard\nOctober 15, 2016 at 17:01\nI am a registered democrat who hasn’t voted for a democrat since McGovern.    Voted Nader * 3.    And last election I voted Stein and I will in this election as well.\nI don’t know who is MORE to blame,  the elites or the sheep who bleat and pay no attention.   I guess things don’t change until they get so bad they have to change.\nSign me frustrated like everyone else.\nExiled off mainstreet\nOctober 15, 2016 at 16:59\nLooking at this again, and more closely, I am certain, as I said above that the charges are red herrings. Trump may have made a mistake addressing them, but otherwise, they become the issues. Evidence that they are, as he suggests, a conspiracy theory is at least partially borne out by the timing of their release and the nature of them as a campaign initiative. Since Trump is running against the Clintons, with their documented far worse record on this score, the whole thing seems ginned up and fabricated. I suspect it will have less effect than some of the commenters above fear. Though I fully agree with most here that Jill Stein is the best, most qualified candidate in the running, my view is that, if possible, the Clinton cabal must be stopped. If they are in again the remaining months (or years if we’re lucky) will be a terminal illness likely ending in armageddon, but certainly in the consolidation of the already existing absolutist military corporate state, described as “soft totalitarianism” by the late political philosopher Sheldon Wolin. Stein herself has indicated that, though Trump would be a disaster, the prospect of Clinton and likely war with Russia is far more serious, so I recommend that in doubtful states, people actually vote for Trump, despite his undoubted faults, and vote for Stein in safe states.\nExiled off mainstreet\nOctober 15, 2016 at 15:39\nI think the sexual issues are red herrings based on the fact they didn’t emerge until it looked like Trump would have a chance to unhorse the establishment’s harpy. I still think that the major issue is survival. We’ll be able to survive Trump but likely won’t survive a nuclear war engaged in on behalf of el qaeda to ensure the permanent dominance of the yankee imperium. Seeing what is at stake, I tend think that the allegations are false or at least exaggerated and intended to take our eyes off the ball, which is survival, and it is unfortunate that Mr. Parry, who has done as much as anybody to warn us of the survival threat, seems to think this is important.\njack epikoureios\nOctober 15, 2016 at 14:15\nMUST SEE VIDEO — this is one hell of a speech, probably, the most amazing words ever uttered by any american president / presidential candidate, congressperson, senator … spread around.\nForget Trumpo the individual, forget the (obviously flawed) messenger, look at the message, the issues raised … the stakes couldn’t be higher. Unfortunately, for America and the rest of the world, the average american voter is politically lobotomized by big media, public schools, hollywood, madison av. etc. Even if T was a saint, the media (pitbulls) would still destroy him; look what they did to (pussy) Sanders and Jill Stein.\nPS: This reminds me of some of the well known speeches of George Carlin\ndahoit\nOctober 16, 2016 at 10:23\nYes,Trump is our savior from the zionists who want no part of American sovereignty,which will end their grandiose schemes.\nJunius\nOctober 15, 2016 at 09:21\nTrump may be a demagogic phony but he is a demagogic phony who threatens the coherence of the power elite and that places him in a category all his own. All the apparatus of the propaganda state is in high gear against him – doesn’t that filter even a little reality through your liberal mindset at all? Has it not even registered in your minds how stories of sexual misconduct are standard weapons in the propaganda arsenal, recently used against Assange and many others whose actions have terrified the ruling elite?\nHistory shows again and again that only ruthless, unprincipled men are capable of destroying ruthless, unprincipled systems. The American republic is long dead. This is real life, not a happy little garden party where the bad guys just give up and go away.\njack epikoureios\nOctober 15, 2016 at 14:19\n“History shows again and again that only ruthless, unprincipled men are capable of destroying ruthless, unprincipled systems.”\nNAILS IT!  Even if Trump was a saint he’d still be destroyed; see what they did to (pussy) Sanders, Jill Stein,\nlet alone MLK and JFK …\nSee my comments/info below.\nScream “My God!” as Trump looks in on them.\nHistory shows again and again…\nDear Mr. Parry;\nThe people aren’t STUCK with either of the two Establishment candidates (D or R). THAT will be the main theme in this election, and beyond. The avatar is here already (I love this language; it appeals to my Panentheist Soul). It is dressed in Green and moving slowly but is unstoppable, like a glacier. Coyote Trickster is doing His work and the outcome is unpredictable.\nBig Al\nSo angry.\nOctober 15, 2016 at 00:11\nRalph Nader and Bernie – what’s up with them?  Diametrically opposed to Clinton on ideology, they rush to her side.  Ralph Nader calls Trump a “betrayer in chief”.  What?  Someone who has supposedly always been on the side of workers doesn’t like someone who wants to bring the jobs back home?  And Sanders, who did not go after Clinton – not really – couldn’t lie down fast enough.  Of course, he did get up in time to purchase – what was it – his third or fourth home.\n“Is November’s outcome predetermined? Shall we ahead of the curve proclaim president-elect Hillary? Should the remaining two presidential debates (sic) be cancelled? Why bother if Hillary already triumphed.\nWas the entire campaign from its onset meaningless theater? Hillary was chosen DNC nominee before it began, Sanders going along for an extended 15-minutes of notoriety, little more than a shameless Hillary puppet after endorsing her for whatever special favors gotten in return, showing he’s as corrupt as America’s entire political establishment.\nEven Ralph Nader turned on Trump, calling him a “betrayer in chief,” shamelessly supporting Hillary, the most ruthlessly dangerous presidential aspirant in US history.\nHe disgracefully ignored the menace she represents, failed to explain America’s deplorable political process too debauched to fix, voters having no say on how they’re governed or by whom.\nGovernance exclusively serving wealth, power and privilege is what politics in America is all about – no matter who holds top positions. They’re all cut from the same dirty cloth – Republicans like Democrats on all issues mattering most.\nNader understands. So why didn’t he explain, focusing his ire only on Trump, giving Hillary a pass, despite her deplorable public record since the 1990s.\nIsn’t that enough to disqualify her from holding any public office? Letting her become head of state with her finger on the nuclear trigger, eager to squeeze it, is unthinkable.\nSunday editions of The New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal online, and pro-Hillary broadsheets nationwide are on the warpath, practically demanding Trump bow out – unheard of in US presidential politics, reaching for despicable new depths.\nThe latest uproar is over his lewd comments, released on videotape. Sleaze isn’t usually a political issue. Making it one might force half the Congress to step down – and correct the record on numerous past presidents guilty of amorous indiscretions.  […]  What matters more – Trump sleaze and everything else disreputable about him or saving humanity from possible annihilation? An easy choice in November.”\nOctober 15, 2016 at 00:37\nWhat matters more – Trump sleaze and everything else disreputable about him or saving humanity from possible annihilation? An easy choice in November.”\nIf only it was that simple.   But it isn’t.   Hillary might start a nuclear war, and Trump might not.   I don’t like the slant on either one, but Trump is slightly preferable if that was the only significant difference.\nBut it isn’t.   A full-bore nuclear holocaust would surely destroy civilization, and possibly humanity.\nWhat neither candidate is doing is proposing a prompt and workable solution to a threat to humanity which actually is crashing in at us.  Climate change will kill us every bit as dead as nuclear war, and has the downside of taking the rest of God’s Creation with it – something nuclear war might not do.\nA cynical person might argue that a relative quick ending would be a better one.\nWhen we’re scheduled to die from either Trump’s flat denial of GW or Hillary’s don’t-give-a-damn useless platitudes, a reasonable person can deduce he’s free to concentrate on their warts.  Both sets are amazingly ugly, but Trump’s are getting the publicity.   And in the slightly longer term, what does it really matter?\nbackwardsevolution\nOctober 15, 2016 at 03:15\nIt matters a lot to me because I’ve got kids.  I don’t know if you do or not (it does make a difference, I’ve found), but I want them to have a good future.  I don’t want a bunch of neocons making stupid mistakes re war.\nAgain, as soon as I see people start talking about over-population and stopping growth dead in its tracks, I’ll start taking them seriously on climate change.  I do not think they’re serious.  I think what they’re talking about is just putting a fake band-aid on the problem in order to shut people up.  In their hands, the same hands that decide everything else, we don’t have a hope.\nKiza\nOctober 15, 2016 at 15:19\nI live in a costal city. Due to “climate change” I should have been drowned by now, as they claimed that polar ice should be melted completely by 2016. Yet, I am still alive and I still can read the pollution of debates by the prolific left-wing polluters such as Zachary.\nZachary Smith\nOctober 15, 2016 at 18:29\nDid you truly not know that melting North Pole ice would have no effect on sea level?\nKiza\nOctober 16, 2016 at 18:25\nSorry I missed the latest release from the AGW priesthood. For all these years we have been reading about some poor islands getting sunk underwater by AGW, but now the melting ice makes little/no difference to the ocean and sea levels. The green colored crooks are making it up as they go and detracting funds from the real environmental issues, the real pollution and the extinction of species.\nIt used to be the Global Warming, now it is the Climate Change, the biggest con in the human history. Anyone with even the compulsory level of education knows that the climate has been changing on the planet Earth since it got its atmosphere, just there was nobody to charge for it before.\nbackwardsevolution\nOctober 14, 2016 at 23:09\n“Here is what we know about the two presidential candidates. Hillary has a long list of scandals from Whitewater and Vince Foster to Benghazi and violation of national security protocols. She is bought-and-paid-for by the oligarchs on Wall Street, in the mega-banks, and in the military-security complex as well as by foreign interests. The proof is the Clinton’s $120 million personal fortune and the $1,600 million in their foundation. Goldman Sachs did not pay Hillary $675,000 for three 20-minute speeches for the wisdom they contained.\nWhat we know about Trump is that the oligarchic establishment cannot stand him and has ordered the Ministry of Propaganda, a.k.a., the US media, to destroy him.\nClearly, Hillary is the candidate of the One Percent, and Trump is the candidate for the rest of us.\nUnfortunately, about half of the 99 percent is too dumb to know this.\nMoreover, if Trump were to end up in the White House, it doesn’t mean he could prevail over the oligarchy.\nThe oligarchy is entrenched in Washington with control over economic and foreign policy positions, think tanks and other lobbyists, and the media.\nThe people control nothing.\nWhat does the world think when they see Donald Trump damned because he doesn’t want war with Russia or the American economy moved offshore?\nWhere in American politics do Washington’s European, British, Canadian, Australian, and Japanese vassals see leadership worthy of their sacrifice of sovereignty and independent foreign policy? Where do they even see a modicum of intelligence?\nWhy does the world look to the most stupid, vile, arrogant, corrupt and murderous government on the planet for leadership?\nWar is the only destination to which Washington can lead.”\nOctober 14, 2016 at 23:05\n“During the sexual scandals of Bill Clinton—the “bimbo eruptions” as Hillary called them—the Democrats and progressive opinion ruled out a person’s sex life as a political factor. Now suddenly nothing more than juvenile locker room banter without the actual sex has become the determinant of political unfitness.\nWhere did the 11-year old recording of locker room talk between Donald Trump and Billy Bush come from? Who recorded it and kept it for 11 years for what purpose? Why was it released the day prior to the second debate between Trump and Hillary? Was the recording an illegal violation of privacy? What became of the woman who recorded Monica Lewinsky’s confession to her of sex with Bill Clinton? Wasn’t she prosecuted for wiretaping or some such offense? Why was Billy Bush, the relative of two US presidents, suspended from his TV show because of a private conversation with Trump?\nYou have to take men’s sexual banter with a grain of salt, just as you do their fish stories. President or candidate Bill Clinton himself publicly engaged in sexual banter. If memory serves, in a speech to blue collar workers, Bill said that the bed of his pickup truck was covered in artificial turf and “you know what that was for.” In the Clinton White House according to reports there were a number of female interns seeking Bill’s sexual attention. The scantily clad young women came to work sans underwear until Hillary put her foot down. One wonders if the Secret Service was told to inspect compliance with the dress code.”\nOctober 14, 2016 at 22:40\ntrump embodies all that is negative about america..he’s arrogant, rich, egotistical and an asshole…obviously over qualified to be president…but the only thing worse than trump is the reaction to him by what passes for a left in america, now joined by an otherwise sensible voice..he’s sexist? omg omg omg..he’s critical of immigration? omg omg omg..he doesn’t want war with russia? omg omg omg..the entire establishment, both its liberal and conservative wings, are more fearful of this schmuck, one of their own, than they were of the new dealer bernie..while we’re moved to join the disgusting parade that makes this simpleton look like an intellectual, we might ponder what it is they fear about him, while we join them in helping elect an even greater evil..\nZachary Smith\nOctober 14, 2016 at 23:34\n… while we join them in helping elect an even greater evil.\nDespite how incredibly stupid it sounds, I agree that Hillary is still a “greater evil”.   But at some point on the “evil” scale matters pass at tipping point.  Mine is lawlessness – the reason I sat out the 2012 election.  Obama’s total disregard for his oath of office was too much for me.  This time Trump is beyond the pale with me on some other issues, so it would be hypocritical beyond belief for me to look down my nose at women who see the man as having snake-navel morality.\nTrump is going to lose, and that’s good.  Very good.\nHillary is going to win, and that’s bad.  Very bad.\nI’m not going to get on my high horse and lecture anybody about this election.    I have been telling a lot of folks how I’m not voting for either one.  In the unlikely event that happens enough, the ‘winner’ might be seen as illegitimate.  I’m not holding my breath, but at this stage that’s the only “good” outcome I can see.\nbackwardsevolution\nOctober 15, 2016 at 00:00\nZachary – Trump is AGAINST globalization, the free trade agreements, open borders, war.  What is more important than that, especially the last one?\nYou said, “Trump is beyond the pale with me on some other issues…” Which are those?\nZachary Smith\nOctober 15, 2016 at 00:18\nTrump is a great believer in The Art of The Deal.   Even before I knew he was trying to lose the election and before I learned the Clintons had him in a no-win and airtight scandal, I knew he was a gamble.   Trump found the anti-trade talk-talk handy for politicking.    No guarantee he’d do it.   I really want to believe he’s really anti-war, but his total ignorance about the state of US military spending makes me suspect he’d be a pawn of the neocons.  Ignorance is not a good thing when confronting a glib expert.\nTorture is both a sin and a crime.  Trump is such a moral leper that he advocates doing it freely.    Not acceptable!   And if a generic woman in Idaho draws her personal line on another issue, I’m not going to dispute her.  Criminality is criminality.\nAs an aside, yesterday I was driving from town when I flipped on the radio.  That’s a habit I can’t stop because in the old days I’d often find some decent music.   Instead I hit a right-wing talk show with a woman announcer and a “guest” who was Doctor so-and-so.  Probably a doctor of divinity, for he was engaged in defending Trump.   A very unhappy young lady had called in to declare that she was upset they were wanting a Christian like herself to disregard every moral teaching she had ever learned and vote for Trump.  The suave Doctor told her that until Jesus ran for political office voters would always be faced with the “lesser evil” choice.\nI don’t know if the smooth-talking creep believed his own pitch or not, but I didn’t linger.   That young Christian woman was right and the two radio people were wrong.   She either has a set of morality rules or she doesn’t.   I briefly wished I had a way of contacting her to applaud, but didn’t, so I turned off the wretched radio instead.\nbackwardsevolution\nOctober 15, 2016 at 01:14\nYes, Trump is ignorant.  Torture IS wrong.  You can always make a man say anything with enough torture, but it doesn’t mean you’ll get the truth.  He is just wrong here, but I think it would take him about five minutes to get up to speed on that.  And we don’t know whether he’s saying this to appease certain people.  I like to think that anyone who gets the “war” question right could quite easily get the “torture” question right too.\nBut in his simplicity he’s right about a lot of things.  He’s right that you can’t have a country with open borders, that too many disparate groups, all vying for attention and rights/privileges, do not make a country.  Too much divide and conquer.  He’s also right about the offshoring of jobs and bringing in foreign workers.  Again, no country.\nHe’s right about the Fed, Wall Street (who are itching to get their hands on the carbon credits game).  One thing I don’t understand is why the climate change believers (I am 3/5ths on their side) are not calling for more drastic action, i.e. tackling over-population, calling for “an end to growth”, calling for products to be manufactured closer to home to save on shipping pollution, etc.  I don’t hear this talk – at all.  All I hear about are carbon credits.  Yeah, right, and who is going to profit off those?  Because, sure as shooting, someone is going to.\nIf we are at one minute to midnight, then why are we talking about friggin’ carbon credits?  Let’s end growth, slowly drop back the population to about a billion, and call it a day?\nHugh R. Hays\nOctober 14, 2016 at 22:27\nThank you,  Robert for your article. Here is some of my thoughts.\nRecent news of deplorable and destructive gender attitudes and behavior\nbehind our presidential campaigns leaves me feeling ashamed and depressed\nabout our country and our two political parties.\nThat changed sharply this morning when I read of the unnamed flight\nattendant who confronted a disrespectful passenger on an Alaska Airline\nflight from Seattle to Burbank. My world began to feel better\nimmediately and took a greater boost as I read that the Management of\nAlaska Airlines supported her and other passengers by removing the male\noffender from the plane. One more reason why Alaska Airlines is number 1\nairline in my books and leaves me grateful to Amber Nelson for sharing\nher experience as a passenger on that flight on Facebook.\nSubsequently Charles Wohlforth’s commentary in todays ADN gives, in my\nopinion, an excellent elaboration of our problems in Alaska with gender\nassault and abuse and how they relate to the attitudes and actions of\nDonald J. Trump. He points out and I second him on how important voting\nfor women and girls in our presidential race is to the future health and\nwell being for all of us and our country. I encourage you to vote and make\na statement on our future and a better world. Thank you.\nbackwardsevolution\nOctober 15, 2016 at 23:33\nHugh – Hillary is a female, but she’s also a crook.  A vote for her is a vote for corruption.  She might not have groped anyone, but she sure as heck stuck up for her husband who did.  Hillary is one of the worst role models ever.  If another woman voted for Hillary just because she’s a woman, they’d be doing an injustice to the country.  A moral, ethical, upstanding woman, yes, but not her.\nI see a difference between Trump and Hillary.  Trump is in your face, outspoken, says whatever is on his mind, transparent.  Hillary is sly, conniving, calculating, hides evidence, opaque.  If you think about it, that is an important difference.  Given a choice between the two of them, you’re a lot safer steering clear of the schemer.\nBut perhaps you weren’t even thinking of Hillary when you made your comment.  I agree that we need good women to set good examples for our girls.\nbackwardsevolution\nOctober 14, 2016 at 21:52\nOops, Hillary, You Blew It:\n“So when Trump had a woman accuse him of groping her on a plane in First Class more than 30 years ago but filed no complaint at the time nor in fact did she say a word about it (and remember, Trump has been damn rich and powerful for a very long time) until days ago, I was damn suspicious.  It was the perfect political hit piece — not only very hard to disprove but had a zero risk of the woman in question facing any sort of sanction, civilly or otherwise, if she was lying.\nWell, she may not face sanctions, but it appears she got caught lying.\n‘Gilberthorpe, 54, said he was sitting across the first class aisle from the couple and saw nothing inappropriate. Leeds was wearing a white pantsuit, he said, while Trump was wearing a suit and cuff-links, which he gave to his British flight companion.\nIndeed, Gilberthorpe claimed, Leeds was “trying too hard” in her attempt to win Trump over.\n“She wanted to marry him,” Gilberthorpe said of Leeds, who apparently made the confession when Trump excused himself and went to the bathroom.\nThere was no kissing, but the “shrill” Leeds was “very much in your face” with the real estate developer.’\nOops.\nNow here’s a first-hand account — and the really bad news for the accuser is that she referenced the man sitting across the aisle, who is “that guy”, in her account!\n‘Gilberthorpe is even challenging Leeds to a public confrontation.\n“I will go to head to head with her — I will meet her again. I will see her eyes across the table with my eyes and I will challenge her on the points she made. And I’ll tell you what, I would do this whether it was for Trump, for Clinton, for Obama, or for any man who’s been accused of sexually molesting someone when I know he did not,” he said.\nLeeds could not immediately be reached for comment.’\nIf this guy (Gilberthorpe) is authentic, “oops” is an understatement.  Sounds like SHE was the one who was coming on to Trump.  Happens all the time.\nZachary Smith\nOctober 14, 2016 at 23:13\n“Gilberthorpe has no evidence to back up his claim — just his self-described excellent memory.”\nFew humans can describe in detail what they were doing and seeing on a random day 30 years ago.   Also, this fellow has a history.\nGilberthorpe made headlines in 2014, when he went public with a claim that as a 17-year-old he procured boys (some who “could have been” underage”) for sex parties with high-ranking British politicians.\nI’m guessing the fellow is lusting after another 15 minutes of fame.\nAs Mr. Parry says, when a guy brags about groping women, it’s hardly surprising that he really did it.  I’d wager the actual numbers of his grope encounters number in the high hundreds or low thousands.  After all, he’s been at it for 70 years, and a respectable percentage of those events would have met with cooperative women.  All the more reason to continue.\nbackwardsevolution\nOctober 14, 2016 at 23:44\nGilberthorpe may have been telling the truth about the high-ranking British politician boy toys.  This goes on all the time.  Was he found to be lying?\nI don’t know, I’ve met lots of guys who brag, and yet what they say never adds up.  It’s just a form of puffery, trying to make themselves look like a player.  But, you’re right, I’m sure Trump has had his fair share of liaisons with cooperative women.  Many, many women are attracted to wealth, prestige and fame and look no deeper than that.\nGilberthorpe said that Ms. Leeds was wearing a white pantsuit, while she said Trump put his hand up her “skirt”.  Maybe the stewardess can remember what she was wearing.  If I was sitting on a plane, seated across the aisle from Trump, I think I’d remember what happened.  It isn’t every day that you meet someone like Trump.\nZachary Smith\nOctober 15, 2016 at 00:03\nSorry, but the only person in that encounter with a good reason to recall everything was the victim.\nThe woman may or may not be truthful, but so far as I’m concerned the British pervert has zero credibility in this issue.\nbackwardsevolution\nOctober 15, 2016 at 00:38\nZachary – “Few humans can describe in detail what they were doing and seeing on a random day 30 years ago.” Yes, in order to remember something, in detail, you would have to have gone over the circumstances in your head again shortly after the incident took place, setting the memory in stone.  We don’t usually do this because most of our day-to-day life is uneventful.  But if you were to meet Mr. Trump, be seated across the aisle from him, this wouldn’t have been a “random” day.  In fact, it was probably a significant day for Mr. Gilberthorpe.  And he probably was paying close attention.\nAnd he didn’t need to recall detail (her shoe color, Trump’s shirt color), only whether he saw groping.  That’s a blatant, in-your-face type of thing.  You either see it or you don’t.\nI guess I’m having the hardest time with Ms. Leeds’ timing, 23 days before a major election, how she’s all offended now, 38 years later.  38 years!  Could it be she feels her candidate is losing and she’s trying to get her 15 minutes of fame by bailing Hillary out?  Who knows.\nIt would be interesting to get the two of them together.  If it happened to me the way she says it did, I’d take him up on it.\nDavid Rossi\nOctober 14, 2016 at 21:08\nHe wasn’t a politician then.  His comment to Billy Bush and Howard Stern were comments about what he could get away with as a rich business man, not as a seasoned politician.  But now he is a politician, though not a polished one, and I give you that he should not lie about what he said or did before.\nSo now, let’s have a comparison to the lies told by Hilllary.  She been long exposed to the political life and has been a seasoned politicain for some time in her own right; shouldn’t she be held to a higher standard?\nAnd what of the consequences of Trump’s lies as compared to Hillary lies?  One is socially incorrect, the other is injurious to our national security.\nBill Bodden\nOctober 14, 2016 at 22:56\nIf they are seeking the highest office in the land both should be held to the highest standards.  Instead, they and their supporters are wallowing in the lower depths of the cesspool which raises the question, “What standards do the American people have when it comes to choosing their president and commander-in-chief?” Answer:  Abysmally low?  Thus, we get the kind of government we, as a nation, deserve.\nJohn\nOctober 14, 2016 at 20:58\nThis is a non issue…..Robert Parry, men love pussy…Women love men who are well off financially….I am a member of a health club for men and women.

The problem isn’t that men have some measure of lust for women but how they engage in intercourse with women.  If Trump had said he had sex  frequently with his wife no one would have considered it remarkable, but when it becomes obvious that he is so contemptuous of women (and their husbands, if applicable) that he forces himself on them then that should be a matter of concern when it comes to giving him the power to treat citizens with equal contempt if in a non-sexual way.\nJoe Tedesky\nOctober 15, 2016 at 01:28\nBill our countrymen and ladies are creatures of the ‘tabloid mentality’, which I believe whether planned or through cultural evolvement, or between the both of these means, has stolen the average Americans brain, or brains if we include everyone. I can’t sight any peer reviews for this phenomena, or why it appears to inflict the American subconscious, but where I believe it rears its ugly head is when you go through any supermarket cashier customer check out isle. Just take note of all the headlines on the front cover of all these celebrity tabloid magazines, and see for yourself if this election doesn’t resemble these tabloids. Our country’s mentality has been marginalized down to scandal laced ‘tabloid’ thinking. It’s great to like celebrities, but here in America we idolize our celebrities too much, way too much.\nI wish I could manage Donald Trump after he loses this election. I would promote him into WWE and have him wrestle only women. Imagine Donald with a mic in his face while sweating, and bad mouthing women…is this not great TV? What would it cost to have the Donald in a wrestling match with Rosia O’Donnell. Donald VS O’Donnell has a nice ring to it.\nBilly Bush could have settled Donald down if only Billy would have said, ‘that ain’t what she told me’. Or freak Donald out by telling him your going to tell her, or Donald’s wife what Trump said…on second thought don’t use that one, you might get beat up or worst, use the ‘ain’t what she told me line. Better yet don’t talk like that.\nGIacomo Casanova in his death space constantly has visits from all his exlovers, one right after the other, any woman who he had ever made love comes face to face with the irresistible lover, and all Casanova can do is cry. This is going to be Trump. One day one of these outraged women will be alone behind closed doors with the muti billionaire real estate mogul, and she will come on him, but he’ll have to shut her down over his confusion to if he should trust this girl. The Donald would collapse not knowing what to do. Although, he just might say screw it, and go for it. Casanova couldn’t do anything other than cry due to his having a guilty conscience. Trump like Casanova won’t be able to kiss the girls due to he won’t know if he should trust them, or not, but then again we’re talking Trump here, so who knows.\nYes all of the Trump accusers are political attack dogs, false flags if you will. The one Trump probably did do something to offend her, is probably sitting at home trying to forget about it. Anything and everything from here on out until Election Day is political garbage…we are now at this moment going full hyper speed tabloid with this 2016 election, and there’s nothing any of us can do about it.

One of the comments I found on narcissism was enlightening.\n“Anyone who knows anything about narcissism as a medical condition and psychological diagnosis knows it has nothing to do with self-love and everything to do with self-hatred. It is a condition brought by child abuse and/or neglect, the denigration of the self in childhood. Those who have it, in order to survive, create a ‘false self’, a self of blameless perfection and grandiosity. These people are to be pitied and helped not emulated or ridiculed. Unfortunately, narcissism is one of the most difficult psychological conditions to treat as those who have it, must protect the false self at all costs and project problems on to everyone else.”\nWhat narcissist do you want:  Trump who wants to negotiate and build, or Hillary who wants to pummel and destroy?\nZachary Smith\nOctober 14, 2016 at 18:18\nThe taped evidence of Donald Trump’s bragging about his predations was available mostly on account of his being famous, but that has already changed.   Now everybody is having their history – momentary brain farts, youthful stupidity and everything else – engraved in stone.    Some of it is voluntary.  I don’t fool with Facebook, but most everybody I know does.  They put everything they’re doing or thinking about into a Big Corporation’s computer files which will most assuredly be saved on cheap terabyte hard drives for the remainder of their lives.    Any time in the future when an unscrupulous defense attorney or prosecutor or unethical cop or well-heeled investigator wants to examine their files, they’ll be right there available.   Worse than that, they’re telling everything about their children, and allowing/encouraging those children to make the same mistakes of moving into glass houses themselves.\nUnless I’m gravely mistaken, the Intelligence Agencies of the US are listening to every single telephone call.  Citizens, non-citizens; it’s all the same.   The computer programs are watching for “key words” which would flag the call for immediate attention, but otherwise the calls are stored as text files because “Talk To Text” software programs have gotten to be very good.   A text file is a tiny one.    Mr. Parry’s essay above saves as a 6.25K text file.  Unless I’ve misplaced a decimal or two, a 1-terabyte hard drive could hold 1.6 billion copies of that file.   So storing the many billions of telephone calls made every day is a piece of cake.  Those conversations are tagged with both the caller and recipient, and will be stored forever.   Anytime it’s desirable to look up some dirt on anybody they’ll be available.\nSo the 2016 election is just a taste of what we’re going to be seeing down the road.   Add all of this to the work of the Corporate Media in it’s reporting/not-reporting modes, and the existence of the no-verification Touch Screen Voting Machines, We The People don’t have a chance.\nAnnie\nOctober 14, 2016 at 17:49\nTrump has no legal grounds to sue the NY Times, true, but no one can doubt that the paper of record, the paper who was complicit in the lies that gave us the Iraq war, along with most of main stream media is complicit in trying to destroy any possibility of a Thrump  presidency. I think that is the greater wrong here, not Donald Trump threatening he will sue the Times for exposing his sexual banter, and groping if indeed all of that is true.  I see no particular value in this article, since his policies of deregulation, his dismissal of climate change, and giving corporate America a 15% flat tax are much more disturbing. I think  Missy Comley Beattie sums things up very nicely in a Counterpunch article online today entitled– It’s Worse Than Pussy Grabbing\n“Trump’s fingerprints are on crotches. Clinton’s are on Haiti, Honduras, Libya, Syria, Iraq, anywhere U.S. Empire lurks. What a choice. It’s worse than pussy grabbing.

I’d slightly alter the rest to say Hillary’s fingerprints are on the death certificates of hundreds of thousands of people who shouldn’t have died because of her clumsy blood thirstiness.\nAs for your final remark; yes, we most certainly are.\nOctober 14, 2016 at 17:44\nMichelle Obama’s speech about disrespectful treatment of women is powerful and necessary, but too bad she never came out and said she’s been “shaken to (her) core” by the murderous war policies of her husband, including his giving billions to Israel despite its decades long record of violating international human rights standards… I guess his getting an undeserved Nobel Peace Prize makes everything okay…\nBill Bodden\nOctober 14, 2016 at 22:38\nI had similar thoughts when I caught a couple of minutes of her screed.  Similar to her husband that is all I can take.  Unfortunately, it isn’t only the occupants in the White House but also almost all of Congress endorsing Israel’s repeated slaughters of people in Gaza.  And that includes eminent liberals such as Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Murphy and Sherrod Brown to name just three.  Groping is one of the seven deadly sins but “bombing the shit” (as Trump so eloquently puts it) out of families is no big deal.  If the choice of Clinton and Trump for president and the unmitigated hypocrisy of Congress and top officials in government agencies are not evidence of a decadent nation I don’t know what is.  Add to that the millions of people who will vote for Clinton and Trump.\nZachary Smith\nOctober 14, 2016 at 17:27\nTo say that Trump is a flawed messenger for a reasonably valid message about the elites having little concern about the suffering of the commoners is a gross understatement. He is the personification of a rich and powerful individual exercising dominion over vulnerable people who can’t fight back. He is, in a word, a phony. And, if you wanted to add another word, he is a demagogic phony.\nThis is entirely true, and it’s been true for a very long time.    This entire election cycle has been a veritable Chinese Fire Drill.  The outcome was predetermined from the outset.  Bill Clinton actively recruited Trump to run for President.  The leaked emails detail how Trump was to be ‘elevated’.   All of this stuff existed during the Republican Primaries.  It wasn’t used then because the plan was to get Trump on the ballot.  To use this stuff they had on him at the exact right time.\nHillary has been the Chosen One from the outset.

Look what happened to Sanders.\nIn 2008 and 2012 Obama was elected by arranging him to run against totally unacceptable Republicans.  When I thought it couldn’t possibly happen again – I thought wrong.  Trump is going to be sacrificed for the sins of all the formerly untouchable men who used their wealth and power to abuse women and others because they actually managed to find somebody who has an uglier veneer than Hillary.\nThere’s no question that Trump is a vile misogynist, and he has multiple outstanding sexual assault allegations against him.\nIt is also true, as Trump says, that Bill Clinton is a piece of work when it comes to women (no, spare me) and that Hillary has attacked those who accused him.\nBut what is more interesting to me is that a norm has been violated. Male politicians regularly molest women.\n~~~~~~~~~~\nFinally, I note that, contrary to what you may have read, the Wikileaks releases from the DNC and Podesta are entirely accurate. In a normal election, they would be dominating the news-cycle. Clinton is a corporate shill and a warmonger who has caused immense suffering in her life.\nThese are not good people. Do not identify with either, nor with their courtiers. Those close to them have sold their souls for power, or its illusion.

First was Trump and Torture.  Second was Trump declaring he planned to give the job of picking Supreme Court Justices to the Heritage outfit.  Third was putting Mike Pence one heartbeat away from the presidency.\nThe main reason I’m so convinced this election is over is that those accusations are really making deep wounds.  Incurable ones, in my opinion.    Even supposing that’s not actually the case, the appearance here truly matters.  That’s because the Diebold-type voting machines need to have a plausible reason for their results.   They’ve most certainly got one now, so even in the unlikely event Trump isn’t as deeply wounded as it looks and somehow seems to get even with Hillary again, everybody is going to easily believe an election outcome where he loses big-time.\nOnly way Hillary loses now is if a video surfaces of her drowning baby kittens or slapping around a baby.    Or of course if she collapses on a stage frothing at the mouth.    Failing something like that, it’s over.\nbackwardsevolution\nOctober 15, 2016 at 01:43\nOn torture he’s uneducated.  On the Heritage Foundation (Supreme Court nominations) and Mike Pence, he’s trying to placate the far right.\n“It’s one thing, however, for a sitting president to seek such advice while in office. Trump, by contrast, is currently fighting to win enough delegates to secure the Republican Party nomination. As such, he has an incentive to win friends at conservative institutions and groups like Heritage have leverage to push Trump to the right. Although a sitting president might ignore especially radical advice from an outside adviser, a primary candidate who does so risks throwing support to one of their opponents.”\nBill Nye\nOctober 16, 2016 at 10:34\nIn the short term it is all about overthrowing Assad in Syria, and war with Russia.\nVote Trump 2016, or start building a bunker.\nDick Nixon\nIf you want to continue the innuendo\nCarlos Slim a major contributor to Clinton Foundation, is the #1 Cell phone contractor with the Federal Government.

Anyone who knows Mr.  Slims ‘MO’ knows he spends grease money with Government, corporate media and politicians to gain favors in Mexico and Now the US\nAirliners at that time did not have seat handles that lifted up. As the accuser (also directly related to the Clinton Foundation) says in her story.\nAccuser waited 30 years just before the Presidential Election to make the charges\nThe battle is Government in Brussels making decision for citizens in America. Sovereignty is an issue in virtually every country in Europe, South America, and even the Philippines as citizens who want a normal life wake up to rule by Banks, George Soros, and the Surveillance Agencies (M6, CIA , and you all know the rest)\nOctober 14, 2016 at 17:36\nFrom CNN’s Jon Ostrower re: movable seat dividers in 1st class during 70s & 80s. – https://twitter.com/jonostrower/status/786447716737880065/photo/1\nBut a pox on both Trump and Clinton\nOctober 14, 2016 at 13:24\nWe won’t be voting our way out of the morass.  Time to commence indictments.\nFascinating how Consortiumnews is so slow–for example, 28 pages classified by Bush which concealed his Saudi “ally” connections to 9-11.  Why is Consortium not screaming it (GW Bush treason) from the rooftops?  Instead, focusing upon the soap opera control drama is somehow helping (?) to navigate through the massive criminality and deception?\nRobert Bruce\nOctober 14, 2016 at 13:48\nRight Ed. Criminality, treason and deception leading to conflict with Russia.  Trump may be a creep but Clinton is corrupt. Clinton wants conflict with Russia and Trump wants cooperation.  If it’s going to be one of the two I’d rather it be Trump.\nDon Lemon\nWhere are the pitchforks?\nIn my 66+ years, never has been so clear the bi partisan establishment and corporate media is aggressively punishing the citizenry of so many countries.\nCNN, MSNBC, and the rest of the alphabet media are so one sided.\nThe arrogance of Mr Hope Change(Obama) , and Crooked Hillary is embarrassing to this long time FDR Democrat. Evildoers exposed by Wikileaks.\nEven the low information voter could see this in the last debate when Trump recounted many of her scandals and she didn’t try to defend.\nThis site excepted, it seems the alternate media takes the tact of no matter what Clinton has done, or does, never vote for someone who calls the above out, even when polls consistently indicate only 6% of American even believe the Corporate controlled media.\nThe only thing the Clinton Klan can do is raise false salacious stories, for their policy narrative is bankrupt. If the corrupt Clinton is elected, the establishment will have succeeded with corporate controlled propaganda and a slew of dirty tricks  not only with Trump, but remember the rigged elections with Bernie Sanders?\nSyrian regime change looms over the horizon and the elections talk sex. Laughable if not so serious.\nStephen Sivonda\nOctober 14, 2016 at 23:06\nDon Lemon… eloquent and simply spoken. I’m 73 and onboard with all you say.  It seems we’ll need a minor miracle to get to the 2020 elections\nKiza\nOctober 14, 2016 at 21:27\nRobert Parry’s argument is complete and utter bunkum. The NYT “groped” women would have been believable if they came out with their stories before the audio came out and many decades ago right after it happened. Where were they a year ago or more when the campaign started? This is a typical orchestrated smear campaign three weeks before the election, by the time it is proven that the women were lying the NYT den of crooks and thieves will be enjoying nice appointments in the Hillary’s administration.\nZachary Smith\nOctober 14, 2016 at 23:53\nFirst, their stories would have been ignored.  Second, if Trump had seen them as a threat he could have bankrupted them.  Like, make an example out of the first ones to discourage the rest.   A quick google search turned up this:\nOne final title:\nAmber Heard was the “perfect victim” — and perfect still isn’t good enough\nShe did everything by the book, from documenting Depp’s rage to donating her settlement — and she’s still doubted\nThe Rich and Powerful win at every turn.\nKiza\nOctober 15, 2016 at 08:17\nWhat you wrote above is simply laughable, every sentence of it.\nWhat does Trump have to do with Catholic priest pedophiles? Guilt by association, the old propaganda trick?\nWhat has changed between now and 2 years ago when the election campaign started, how come Trump could have bankrupted the female “victims” then but cannot bankrupt them now?\nYour problem appears to be that a Trump is rich. But everything you wrote about the rich getting away with anything applies much more to Hitlary. As someone wrote: even if Trump’s fingerprints are on a few crotches, Hillary’s fingerprints are on hundreds of thousands of death certificates already, especially of children, and could be on millions or billions if she is elected.\ncol\nOctober 15, 2016 at 20:09\nMy exact thoughts i spoke yesterday to a good friend. Tried to wake him up about the lies 24/7.  I like number 1 nuclear power talking nicely to number 2 nuclear power, not shouting calling names and plotting paybacks. Well along come a Trump, who to great cost (trump loves Putin Trump must be a traitor ) kinda articulates a more peaceful relationship.\nYou better Trump  that, than be dead\nGina de Miranda\nOctober 15, 2016 at 13:02\nThis is very similar to the state of the country in the 1800s after 40 years of Republican rule.\nBill Bodden\nOctober 15, 2016 at 19:05\nOne theory I came across recently suggested that the Clinton campaign wanted Trump to be the winner of the GOP contest so they worked with the MSM to that end on the belief Trump would be easier to beat.  As for women not coming out before a recent report indicated that the vast majority of women who are assaulted don’t report their assault to anyone.  With a few coming out against Trump others may have been encouraged to join them for vindication.\nKiza\nOctober 16, 2016 at 18:16\nOk, let us conclude: your “vast majority of women” wait for when their claims cannot be disproven in time to come out with their claims. The allegations make a difference, but the proof does not, where did I here about this technique?\nIf US was not the cesspool it is, the women who make such allegations but are proven to have lied later would end up in jail.\nBrad Owen\nOctober 15, 2016 at 07:43\nI know what you’re saying, but at least we get to say exactly what we’re thinking here. The Establishment already knows what we’re thinking, since they are the ones who’ve perpetrated these crimes upon us…they know the counter-thrust is coming, just don’t realize how over-whelming it’s going to be. It is sweet.\nBill Bodden\nOctober 14, 2016 at 12:54\nAn equal, probably greater, problem is the number of potential voters in America who believe in and will vote for Trump and Clinton, two charlatans complicit in the worst presidential election charade in generations.  Dubya and Al Gore were awful, but their defects were not as obvious at the time as those presented by the two leading contenders in the current debacle.\nJoe Tedesky\nOctober 14, 2016 at 13:13\nBill you and I wrote back and forth about what to do with this election a couple of months ago. At that time you brought up how a very low voter turnout would deprive the winner any real political capital. I might add that we threw into the mix that voting for a third or maybe even a fourth candidate would produce the same results. Lately I have been meeting more and more people who by they’re own frustration are more than likely going to do a no vote or go third/fourth, but definitely not vote for Hillary or Trump. The ‘no political capital vote’ may possibly be the only weapon left for the American voter to rely upon. Wish there were more I could add to this, but for now the ‘no vote’ will have to do.\nMelvin Podesta\nOctober 14, 2016 at 17:57\nRe: very low voter turnout would deprive the winner any real political capital.\nNothing a false flag operation can’t solve. Careful the first part of 2017.\nJoe Tedesky\nHey it worked for George W.,why not for Hillary?\nThe article to the link I’m providing below tells you where the term false flags comes from. When on this websites page somewhere in the middle of this piece will appear an ad (mine was Hulu) just keep on scrolling down and the words will reappear.\nOctober 14, 2016 at 18:53\nTed, I am one of those frustrated voters. I’ve refused to vote for either party since 2010. However, many of those who were foolish enough to ask my opinion and were shocked to learn that I do not vote or do not vote for either major party, castigate me for either neglecting my duty or wasting my vote(Jill Stein). My reply has always been that at least my conscience is clear, having not knowingly voted for a criminal or corrupt POS.\nJoe Tedesky\nOctober 15, 2016 at 02:07\nOur country could use a truly competitive third party. People say how you can’t complain if you didn’t vote, I sáy that’s garbage since you probably have paid taxes into this corrupt system for most ot all of your adult life. Who gets to complain at a restaurant? The person who made up the menu, or the dining customer?\nForget Hill and vote Jill!\nBrad Owen\nOctober 15, 2016 at 07:35\nThat’s what I’m doing, and sending her $27 (the typical Bernie package) a month until election, then sending Green Party US $10 a month for the rest of my life (“Union Dues” for this “Citizens’ Political Union”). I’m not just ignoring D and R, I’m seeking to destroy them for being accessories to the destruction of my Country. Those bastards will pay for their crimes-against-humanity, big-time. Those politicians not a part of the crime had better change their designation from D or R, to G.\nJoe Tedesky\nBrad, spoken like a true Patriot.\nBrad Owen\nOctober 15, 2016 at 15:19\nYes Joe. We Patriots will have these imperial Tory bastards on the run once again. Hopefully we’ll have them retreating so far into the deep dark Shadows that they’ll NEVER find their way back out again.\nColeen Rowley\nJill Stein points out the huge conflict of interest that Big Media has in donating millions to Hillary Clinton’s foundation and which is, in part, the reason for the media “blackout” of Stein’s campaign: http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/15/jill-stein-clinton-foundation-donors-in-corporate-media-prop-up-hillary-campaign/ .  George Stephanapoulos didn’t even disclose that he donated $75,000 to Killary when he reported on the Clinton Foundation!\nBig Media has less angst about covering Gary Johnson’s campaign.  Maybe that’s because they believe Johnson draws votes away from Trump while they believe Stein draws votes away from Clinton.\nJoe Tedesky\nOctober 15, 2016 at 22:44\nAlways good to get your input Coleen Rowley. The way I see it, is when CNN goes full throttle on a news subject then somethings up. CNN isn’t alone with this over the top reporting, but I will focus on them for now with this comment. Don Lemon a few times has forbid Trump pundits from even mentioning Hillary Clinton’s name when, as he puts it, we’re talking about Trump not Hillary, as he shuts down the anti-Hillary rants. Anderson Cooper interviewed the woman who claimed Trump tried to put his hand up her dress, and yet with her story having no witnesses, and nothing much more than her word to go on, made this a big scope of some kind. Gee, writing about this election sometimes sounds like we are writing a porn novel. Anyway, I can’t but help feeling how everything about this election seems fishy, and then I have to remind myself that the Clintons are back in the spotlight. God help us for what we Americans will need to endure for the next four years with the Clintons back in the White House.\nForget Hill Go with Jill!\nGina de Miranda\nI am with you\nOctober 16, 2016 at 18:17\nYour vote doesn’t count. No vote or third/fourth party vote. Matters not HRC will win.\nTannenhouser\nOctober 16, 2016 at 18:24\nYou should all wear green hats for Jill and some other agreed upon color for Gary and hang out all day at poling stations EN MASS. It’s the only way you will break the duopoly.\nAt least that way your vote might actually count.\nGina de Miranda\nOctober 15, 2016 at 12:02\nI refuse to vote for either one of these Trojan horses.\nHank\nOctober 15, 2016 at 12:57\nPresidential election charade?  Charade in the sense that the media has intentionally gone to lynch mob mode with regards to Donald Trump.  They want Americans to believe that a man who can build an financial empire WITHOUT being a politician can’t be President.  Meanwhile, that same media covers up the crimes and scandals that the Clintons have left behind them these past 30 years!  I would much rather have a President who uses the word “pussy” than one who will initiate a full-scale WW3!  I would much rather have a maverick like Trump, with ALL of his personal quirks and offensive mannerisms, than a candidate who is nothing more than a glorified puppet for the military/industrial complex!  The only thing keeping this Clinton/Trump “election” a reality is the American peoples'(millions of them!) lack of knowledge about Bill and Hillary Clinton, and that knowledge is being kept from the public by the MSM, which chooses instead to smear and belittle a man who will never come close to the Clinton’s criminality!  It is not the Dems vs, the Repubs, but the War Party vs. the rest of us!\nOctober 17, 2016 at 18:33\nMike Pence: Donald Trump never quits, he is a fighter, he is a winner, he embodies the spirit of America he is strong and he will make America great again.\nClinton-Dem Operatives Admit They Pay Provocateurs to Incite Violence at Trump Rallies\nBecome a Consortium News member!\nMake your tax-deductible donation by clicking  here.\nSUBSCRIBE  to Our Free Email News\nSign up for regular email updates\nFirst Name:\nLast Name:\nIn Memoriam Robert Parry (1949-2018)\nBooks by Robert Parry\n",
