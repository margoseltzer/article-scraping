When I got home I couldn't sleep,\" she told CBS Minnesota . \"I mean, the adrenaline was still kind of working and I thought, 'You know what? There is a social media post out there.'\"\nWhile her social media post got thousands of likes in 24 hours, Craven admitted she had no idea how big the message would grow.\n\"I put it out the next morning thinking wouldn't it great if I got like 50 likes,\" Craven said.\nÂ \"We were just tickled that everyone got a kick out of post, and it's a wonderful tribute to what the Vikings did.\"\nThe Vikings are gearing up to face off against the Eagles in the NFC championship game Sunday. While Craven might have convinced Vikings fans to attend mass during the morning services on Sunday, she may have trouble filling seats at the 7 p.m. service.\n\"That's going be around halftime of the NFC Championship [game],\" Vikings fan Jeffrey Galbavy told CBS.\nRelated Articles\nMore In Entertainment\n",
