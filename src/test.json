        "text": "In a 2018 report to India’s National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), an unprecedented 35 percent of cyber attacks against the country were attributed to China. Although such attacks have not generated a catastrophic impact in terms of damaged infrastructure, knocked down power grids and any related casualties, China’s cyber policy against India could undermine the country’s conventional power in a future military conflict.\n\nDespite the risks India’s response has been one of restraint, or what might amount to turning the other cheek. While puzzling, such posture is not uncommon among countries embedded in enduring international rivalries. India’s defensive posture is a rational, albeit short-term, response to an ongoing series of cyber attacks, but its current efforts to ramp up cyber defenses would have a better, long-term deterrent capability if the country joined forces with other countries that China has targeted in Asia to bolster cyber cooperation against a common foe.\n\nChina’s Cyber Threat\n\nWhile China’s investment in cyber warfare began in 1997 in large part to offset its conventional weakness against the United States and Russia, the country now uses cyber operations to target its other rivals. That it focuses heavily on India is not surprising. The two are so-called enduring rivals, countries with a long history of militarized disputes that dates back to the 1962 Sino-Indian War. Most recently, in 2016, India entered Doklam territory in Bhutan, a plateau of strategic significance, to stop Chinese forces from constructing a road in the area. Today, India’s concerns also involve the sea. As China makes its move to dominate the South China Sea and expand its naval power, it is in India’s interest to keep international seas free.\n\nFor China there are undoubtedly even bigger concerns that motivate its cyber strategy. Regional dominance becomes difficult when your competitor is forging closer military cooperation with the world’s military hegemon. Whether it’s the joint U.S-Indo air forces exercises in 2018, the boost in U.S. arms sale to India over the past decade, or the annual bilateral Malabar naval war games in the Bay of Bengal that have become a trilateral exercise since Japan became a permanent partner in 2015, the expansion of India and the United States’ strategic partnership has resembled a counterbalancing effort to China’s growing influence in Asia.\n\nBetween 2010-2018, China’s main goal in targeting India was to gain access to sensitive information from the government and the private sector (over 55 percent of cases), followed by disruption of daily activities as was seen in 2010 when China’s use of Stuxnet worm to compromise India’s communication satellite led to the loss of TV signal for many. Intrusion with the use of malicious software such as Trojans to enter the target’s network or software program has been the most common form of method in cyber attacks during this time period. Such intrusions are particularly dangerous. They can remain dormant for a long time only to emerge at a later date.\n\nIndia’s Restrained Response\n\nAt first, India’s somewhat muted response to China’s cyber attacks seems surprising. In the world of realpolitik where the balance of power is at stake, one might expect a counter threat or equivalent retaliation. Neither has happened.\n\nAt the 2012 Munich Security Conference, the clear takeaway was that India’s efforts to manage incoming cyber attacks were disjointed and not serious. To mitigate the crisis, the government was set on developing a preventive solution aimed at developing indigenous microprocessors and reducing the country’s imports of military software, which have accounted for nearly 70 percent of all such software. In 2012 there was also a proposal to create a command control center for monitoring critical infrastructure and responding to breaches.\n\nYet even these preventive attempts have been slow to materialize. In 2017 cyber security expert Rahul Tyagi explained that India continues to import most of its hardware from China, making it vulnerable to attacks. A CEO of a private defense company who spoke anonymously in 2018 dubbed the “Make in India” push as “virtually a nonstarter.” The country, according to Tyagi, needs more time and money to improve defensive cyber capability and can’t even contemplate using cyber as an offensive weapon.\n\nWhile India’s handling of incoming cyber attacks has been lethargic, in the short term it could be considered a rational response to threat management. Restraint is a feasible policy due to the uncertainty connected to cyber attacks. Attribution remains a problem in the cyber domain, making escalation more risky. While attacks have been traced to hackers operating in China, the Chinese government has repeatedly denied responsibility for the actions. Unlike with the use of conventional weapons that are the domain of the country’s military, a government can deny its connections to hackers. In this context, the targeted country must proceed with caution.\n\nThere is also the question of how to respond to a cyber attack when a country lacks credible offensive cyber capability that it could use as a deterrent. Should it turn to conventional weapons? Such a move comes with high costs. The enemy might perceive a conventional response as too escalatory in proportion to a cyber attack and escalate the conflict even more, edging dangerously close to an all out war. After all, China’s cyber attacks have not created any damage to India’s infrastructure or resulted in casualties to justify a more provocative conventional response.\n\nRelying on restraint as a strategy becomes even more critical when considering the broader political context in which the attacks take place. Countries that are embedded in a long-term rivalry and that also happen to have other enduring enemies — the case for India and its other rival Pakistan — simply cannot afford to escalate most of the crisis situations. Enduring rivals experience frequent militarized disputes. To manage resources effectively, they must prioritize the urgency of threats and exercise caution to avoid escalation on multiple fronts. By prioritizing conventional threats from Pakistani militants over cyber attacks from China, India has recognized the complexity of threat management.\n\nYet there is an inherent risk when the short-term strategy of restraint transitions into a long-term policy of buying time while hoping for the best. Restraint, when practiced for too long, can encourage the enemy to simply continue with more attacks. And this has the potential to seriously undermine national security. Consider, for example, the 2009 incident in which Chinese hackers stole classified intelligence from India’s military on missile systems as well as intel on India’s security situation in its various states. In case of a military conflict, such info might be used by the Chinese military not only to exploit systems’ weaknesses but also to identify an appropriate window of opportunity to strike when the country is most vulnerable politically. An even more worrisome scenario could involve using a sleeper worm that could be activated to infiltrate and damage military technology. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has long envisioned the use of computer-networked operations as critical to its success in the early stages of a conflict and a series of cyber attacks allows it to effectively gauge the weaknesses of Indian systems.\n\nA Multination Cyber Coalition: A Defense Partnership for the Future\n\nA robust response to this conundrum would be to make serious improvements in India’s cyber posture, as the country has recently started to do. The announcement in March of this year that India will have a Defense Cyber Agency that will rely on existing capability from the armed forces to better respond to cyber attacks is a promising start. But such an initiative may be insufficient to deter China given the meager spending devoted to cyber defense. Moreover, it is not entirely clear how relying on existing capabilities from the armed forces can limit attacks that have been undeterred by such capabilities. Part of the problem is that India is trying to go at it alone, aiming for an internal capabilities buildup that lags behind China’s investment in cyber weapons’ capacity to infiltrate defenses.\n\nThe country would benefit from leading an effort to create a multination cyber coalition (MNCC), a common defense partnership for countries in Asia at the highest risk of cyber attacks from China. Such countries could most likely include China’s other enduring rivals such as Japan. The MNCC countries would harness their collective cyber capabilities and knowledge to better identify and respond to cyber attacks. Such an initiative could resemble NATO’s approach to cyber defense more so than the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ new efforts to develop cyber norms and confidence building measures in Asia Pacific. While countries are still responsible for their own cyber defenses, NATO supports its members by sharing real-time intelligence on threats and best practices for handling such threats. Investments in education, training, and exercises are key aspects to strengthening capabilities. The MNCC could offer similar benefits to its members as well as the opportunity to receive assistance from rapid reaction defense teams that could respond to more severe threats.\n\nCreating such an initiative would be equivalent to bolstering countries’ deterrence by denial strategy simply by making it harder for China to achieve the key objectives behind its cyber attacks thanks to more robust defenses. The added benefit of the multinational approach is that it would discourage China from responding aggressively to any individual state that joins the initiative as embracing even more escalatory posture against all members could risk the kind of international crisis that might not be in China’s interest. Furthermore, the MNCC’s focus would be defensive in nature, leaving the development of offensive cyber capabilities for each state to pursue individually. This would improve deterrence by denial while reducing China’s likely negative reaction to what would be a defensive rather than an offensive initiative.\n\nLeading the effort to establish a multination cyber coalition might be India’s best bet for developing a robust, long-term cyber prevention strategy for the future that promotes national security while concurrently reducing the possibility of conflict escalation.\n\nElizabeth Radziszewski is an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Rider University in New Jersey who also teaches in the Master’s program in Homeland Security at Rider.\n\nBrendan Hanson and Salman Khalid are graduate students in the Homeland Security program at Rider University.",

        "text": "This story is from February 6, 2010\n\nPORT BLAIR: India neither wants to be the regional cop or `headmaster' in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), nor be a part of any multi-lateral security cooperation axis seeking to `contain' China. Instead, it just wants to further bolster its `friendship across the seas' to cover the entire Asia-Pacific region.This, at least, is the public stand, given that prickly China is always quick to take umbrage over any grouping of foreign navies that takes place in the region. Beijing, for instance, had lodged a strong protest against the 13th Indo-US Malabar naval wargames in the Bay of Bengal in September 2007 after they were expanded to include the Australian, Japanese and Singapore navies as well.Speaking at the multi-lateral `Milan' exercise and conclave at the Andaman and Nicobar Islands archipelago on Friday, Navy chief Admiral Nirmal Verma said the endeavour should not be viewed as a `security bloc' against China.\"The very theme of Milan is more about coming together in a constructive manner to tackle man-made disasters (read terrorism and piracy) and natural disasters... I do not think such suspicions (on part of China) should exist,'' said Admiral Verma.The seventh edition of Milan, the largest so far, has warships and delegations from a dozen countries, ranging from Australia, New Zealand, Philippines and Thailand to Indonesia, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.Asked about Pentagon's latest quadrennial defence review, which visualizes India's role in Asia as \"a net provider of security in the Indian Ocean and beyond'', even as it expressed concern over China's military development, the Navy chief said, \"India has no intention of playing a headmaster 's role in IOR.''\"But we would like to share and initiate processes since there are common things which affect us like piracy in the Gulf of Aden. Milan is actually about navies coming together on areas of convergence,'' he added.The fact, however, remains that US, India and several Asia-Pacific countries eye the rapid modernization of China's 2.5-million strong People's Liberation Army, with special focus on strategic transborder and maritime military capabilities as well as anti-satellite and cyber-warfare capabilities, with a great deal of suspicion and concern.China's military asymmetry with India is especially stark. To India's 16 diesel-electric submarines, for instance, China has 52 conventional and 10 nuclear-powered submarines. At least three of them are armed with long-range nuclear missiles.Moreover, China has been assiduously making strategic moves in the IOR by forging links with eastern Africa, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Cambodia and the like. While China certainly needs to secure its energy sea lanes, it also amounts to a virtual strategic encirclement of India.Asked about PLA's rapid modernization, Admiral Verma said, \"Our Navy's plans are made taking into account what is happening in the region and are not specific to any one country. Yes, we have to build our force-levels as deterrence and we are keen that we do it faster.''Given China's sensitivities, the UPA government has decided that the Malabar exercise with the US, after the 2007 experience, will be purely bilateral ones for some time to come.Consequently, the Malabar wargames on the west coast this April-May will see the US fielding just four-five destroyers/frigates, a nuclear submarine and some maritime patrol aircraft, which will match their combat skills against a similar number of Indian warships.",

        "text": "This story is from January 19, 2010\n\nNEW DELHI: Chinese hackers made a concerted attempt to penetrate into \"sensitive\" Indian offices on December 15, 2009, the day several US firms handling defence contracts complained of cyber attacks by the Chinese. Revealing this to British daily `The Times', outgoing NSA M K Narayanan also said that this was not the first attempt by the Chinese to hack into the systems of important government offices.Narayanan said his own office was among the government departments targeted on December 15 and that the attack came in the form of an e-mail with a PDF attachment containing a 'Trojan' virus which allows a hacker to access a computer remotely and download or delete files. Narayanan said in the interview that the virus was detected and officials were told not to log on until it was eliminated.\"People seem to be fairly sure it was the Chinese. It is difficult to find the exact source but this is the main suspicion. It seems well founded,\" he told `The Times'. He added that India was cooperating with the US and Britain to strengthen its cyber defences.The Chinese government had denied any role in the attacks, with a foreign ministry spokeswoman saying that hacking in whatever form was prohibited by law in China.Narayanan, however, said that even though he expected China to be an increasingly high security priority for India, the main threat still came from militants based in Pakistan.Narayanan, who is slated to take over as governor of West Bengal, also expressed displeasure with Britain for not being able to call Pakistan's bluff. He said Islamabad had done nothing to dismantle militant groups since the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, and criticised Britain for accepting its excuse that such groups were beyond its control. \"The British are still blinkered on this. We believe Pakistan's policy of using terror as a policy weapon remains,\" Narayanan said, adding India is anxious to prevent an attack from Pakistan during the Commonwealth Games in October. \"From Pakistan's point of view, it's important to disrupt the Games so you can claim that India is not a safe place,\" Narayanan said.",

        "text": "This story is from October 7, 2010\n\nNEW DELHI: India has expressed concern at the way both Pakistan and China are rapidly bolstering their military capabilities, in the backdrop of the armed forces warning that the possibility ``a two-front war'' breaking out cannot be ruled out altogether even though it may be a remote scenario.``Our neighbours are building their military capabilities at a feverish pace. Thus, to successfully meet such challenges, the need for us is to be vigilant and prepared at all times,'' said defence minister A K Antony on Wednesday.India's ``strategic, geopolitical situation'' and the compulsions of history pose unique challenges. ``Some nations are keen to incite threats to our unity and integrity,'' he said, speaking after the Field Marshal Cariappa annual memorial lecture by former President APJ Abdul Kalam.Kalam, on his part, said India has to be prepared for ``fast-paced, technology-driven warfare'', stretching from nuclear to cyber-warfare. ``Future warfare, that is powered by cyber war, can create destruction effortlessly at the speed of light. ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles) and other nuclear weapons will become insignificant in the cyber-warfare environment,'' he said.Before 2020, said Kalam, the armed forces should have space-based surveillance and reconnaissance networks, anti-ballistic missile systems, ICBMs with a range beyond 5,000 km, nuclear submarines armed with strategic missiles and the like.Antony, in a bid to ward off criticism that the UPA government is not doing enough to swiftly equip the armed forces with the latest weapon systems, said the Centre was ``alive'' to the pressing need to quicken the pace of modernisation.A number of measures, he declared, have been initiated to provide impetus to defence procurements to ensure the armed forces can effectively guard against threats to the country's land borders, airspace and maritime energy supply routes.``The defence ministry is in the process of implementing a new procurement policy, which would be even more effective and quicker than the current Defence Procurement Procedure-2008,'' said Antony.Holding that the private and public sector ``can and must co-exist'' in the defence sector, he said the government had undertaken several steps to promote public-private partnerships to fast-track military modernisation.``All the agencies in the public and private sector must cooperate to share efforts and resources to address design, manufacturing and maintenance concerns of our defence forces. On their own, defence PSUs are unlikely to be able to meet all the requirements of armed forces at the desired pace and within the required timeframes,'' he said.Antony, however, admitted efforts to reduce the import content of India's defence requirements were ``not yielding the desired results'', given that the country still gets 70% of its military hardware and software from abroad.``We are still far off from establishing ourselves as a major defence equipment manufacturing nation... Given our economic status, this is not a very desirable state of affairs. If modernisation is to be more meaningful, it must go hand-in-hand with indigenisation,'' he said.",

        "text": "MUNICH: After the first four \"real'' battlefields of land, air, sea and now increasingly space, India needs to get very serious about the virtual front as well. The country should begin planning a full-fledged military cyber command, instead of the current piecemeal and disjointed steps to bolster cyber-security , grappling as it already is with incessant online espionage and other attacks from China, Pakistan and others.This was the clear takeaway from the deliberations on cyber-security and cyber-warfare in the high-profile Munich Security Conference on Sunday, even though India hardly figured in the discussions.Experts said the emergence of \"cyber-weapons'' like the Stuxnet software 'worm' that was used to sabotage Iran's nuclear programme over a year ago, had changed the entire security ballgame, almost on par with the use of nuclear bombs for the first time in 1945.\"Someone used a cyber-weapon in peacetime to physically destroy what the nation (Iran) would describe as its critical infrastructure. It was a new class of weapon that caused a thousand centrifuges in Iran to self-destruct,'' said General (retd) Michael V Hayden, former director of the American CIA and National Security Agency.Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt expressed fear that the risk of terrorists or others getting hold of cyber-weapons was possibly much higher than nuclear weapons. \"Stealing and using Stuxnet might be more easy and dangerous than nuclear weapons,'' he said.Russian cyber expert Eugene Kaspersky, in turn, warned developed countries would be the \"main victims'' of cyber-warfare since they were the most inter-connected in terms of information technology.Well-executed cyber-attacks, after all, can cripple a nation's military assets and strategic networks, energy grids and banking, communication and \"infostructure''. Moreover, unlike missiles or nuclear bombs, which can be traced back to an adversary for retaliatory strikes, here the enemy remains largely unknown.Stuxnet is a case in point. Though a few fingers were pointed at Israel, as also the US, the exact origin of the 'worm' still remains unknown. But it's clear it was the handiwork of a resource-rich state agency, not some non-state hackers or fringe elements.So, it's no wonder several countries like the US and the UK have set up cyber military forces to thwart deadly attacks that can come from anywhere, at any time. The US, for instance, has created a Cyber Command, under a four-star general, tasked with launching a \"full spectrum'' war in the boundary-less cyberspace , when directed to do so, apart from protecting the around 15,000 American military networks from attacks round-the-clock.India has reason to worry. China-watchers in the Indian security establishment say Beijing already has two to three \"hacker brigades'' and 30,000 computer professionals in its militia. China, in fact, has made cyber-warfare one of its topmost military priorities, with its hackers regularly breaking into sensitive computer networks of countries like the US, the UK, Germany and India.China-based online espionage gangs have been regularly accessing classified documents from several Indian security and diplomatic establishments, as was also brought out in the \"Shadows in the Cloud'' report by a group of Canadian and American cyber-security researchers a couple of years ago. India, therefore, has to be on the guard in the virtual world as well.",

        "text": "NEW DELHI ― Even as India’s new 2018-2019 defense budget rises, it seems rising manpower costs within the military will hinder some of the armed forces’ plans to acquire new weapons.\n\nThe country’s defense budget rose by 5.89 percent to $46.16 billion, against $43.59 billion in the previous year.\n\n\n\nOf this, $30.61 billion is allocated for revenue expenditure meant for pay and allowances for the more than 1.4 billion active military personnel. The government has allocated $15.15 billion for the purchase of new weaponry as well as liabilities to which India previously committed.\n\nIn addition, $17 billion will go toward defense pensions meant for retired military personnel.\n\nVivek Rae, a former director general for defense procurement within the Ministry of Defence, said that “budgetary constraints” are making it impossible to increase the pace of defense modernization efforts. “Business will continue as usual, until we land in a crisis,” he noted.\n\n“The allocation for defense is undoubtedly quite low, but there is no danger of the MoD defaulting on obligatory expenses on salaries, ration and clothing, or on honoring the contractual liabilities,” according to Amit Cowshish, the MoD’s former financial adviser for defense acquisition.\n\n“Modernization will continue at the slow pace as in the past, resulting in new contracts worth about $10 billion being signed next year, which is the average value of the contracts signed every year during the last four years,” he added.\n\nUnder the new budget, the Army will receive about $20 million for pay and allowances and well as the maintenance of land warfare systems and ammunition stocks. Only $4.19 billion is allocated for the purchase of new military hardware.\n\n× Fear of missing out?

By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nThe Air Force will receive $5.58 billion to purchase new fighters and helicopter, while $4.5 billion will go toward maintenance and operational preparedness of its aircraft.\n\nThe Navy will receive $3.25 billion to purchase new warships and other naval gear. About $3 billion has been allocated for maintenance of the existing fleet.\n\nIndia’s state-owned defense research and development agency, the Defence Research and Development Organization will receive $1.52 billion to kick-start new defense R&D programs; $1.26 will go toward existing programs.\n\nIndia’s state-owned ordnance factories have been allotted $125.62 million for new ordnance programs, including ammunition. Existing products for the defense of the air, land and sea will be allotted $113.59 million.\n\nThe budget also provides money for the Indian Coast Guard, the MoD and other miscellaneous expenditures.\n\n“No ruling government in India can give quick-fix solution to meet pressing armament procurement demands, which as of today would cost around $75-100 billion, because country faces two front conventional and nuclear threats ― both from China and Pakistan,” a senior MoD official asserted. “Therefore, military manpower cannot be curtailed, which leaves little money for buy[ing] new weapons.”\n\nThe official declined to comment on how defense programs such as single-engine fighters, new-generation conventional submarines and multiple types of helicopters will take off under Make in India’s strategic partner policy.\n\nNotably, only $22 million has been embarked for mega Make in India initiative which is planned to kick-start army’s $4 billion tactical communication system, $6.25 battlefield management system and over $9 billion futuristic infantry combat vehicle programs.\n\n“The new [defense] budget has no room for new programs,” said the CEO of a private defense company, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Make in India push is virtually a non-starter, which will eventually force [private] sector to exit the defense market.”",

        "text": "CERT report says that maximum number of cyber-attacks on official Indian websites are from China\n\nA few years ago, nobody could imagine the crimes on the internet. Since the time India has been exposed to technology, it has witnessed various cyber crimes -- such as WannaCry Ransomware -- one of the biggest cyber attacks in history, that swept the world in May 2017.\n\nThe infamous attack impacted the top five cities of India, including Kolkata, Delhi, Bhubaneswar, Pune, and Mumbai. Looking at this, India doesn't seem far behind the other countries where the rate of cyber crimes is rising.\n\nCyber crimes in India: CERT report\n\nIndeed, a lot of Indian websites have been attacked by the hackers sitting in each part of the globe. Indian Computer Emergency Response (CERT-In) has recently released some shocking details.\n\nAccording to the report, China has made the highest number of attacks on the official websites of India. While analysing the data for April and June, CERT has found that 35 per cent of intruding activities on Indian cyberspace are from China.\n\nHere's a list of countries intruding on our websites:\n\nThe United States of America: 17 per cent\n\nRussia: 15 per cent\n\nPakistan: 9 per cent\n\nCanada: 7 per cent\n\nGermany: 5 per cent\n\nNetherlands: 4 per cent\n\nNorth Korea and France: 2 per cent (each)\n\nOthers: 4 per cent\n\nCompanies affected by these attacks\n\nOil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)\n\nNational Informatics Centre (NIC)\n\nIndian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC)\n\nCentre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS)\n\nBanks affected by these attacks\n\nPunjab National Bank (PNB)\n\nOriental Bank of Commerce (OBC)\n\nState Bank of India (SBI)\n\nState data centres (particularly in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka)\n\n\n\nWhat are cyber crimes?\n\nCyber crimes: What does that mean? Image credits: Getty\n\nCyber crimes are criminal activity that involves computer and the internet. In other words, it can be defined as an unlawful act where the computer is used either as a tool or a target or both.\n\nIt covers phishing, credit card frauds, bank robbery, illegal downloading, industrial espionage, child pornography, kidnapping children via chat rooms, scams, cyber terrorism, creation and/or distribution of viruses, spam and so on.\n\nCyber laws in India\n\nCyber crimes are increasing in India rapidly, the Indian government has made various laws and provisions to control these activities. Two of the most important laws, include:\n\nInformation Technology Act 2000\n\nIndian Penal Code 1860\n\nSections under IT Act 2000:\n\nTampering with Computer source documents - Sec.65: Whoever intentionally or knowingly destroys, conceals or changes any computer’s source code that is used for a computer, computer program, and computer system or computer network.\n\nHacking with computer systems, data alteration - Sec.66: Whoever with the purpose or intention to cause any loss, damage or to destroy, delete or to alter any information that resides in any person’s computer.\n\nPublishing obscene information - Sec.67: Whoever transmits or publishes or cause to publish any obscene material in electronic form. Any material that is vulgar or appeals to be lubricious or is meant to corrupt any individual who is likely to have regard to all relevant circumstances to read or to see or to hear the matter that contained in it shall be sentenced on the first convict with a term that may extend up to five years of imprisonment.\n\nUnauthorised access to protected system Sec.70: Any person who secures access or attempts to secure access to a protected system in contravention of the provisions of this section shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine.\n\nBreach of Confidentiality and Privacy - Sec.72: Any person, who has secured access to any electronic record, book, register, correspondence, information, document or other material without the consent of the person concerned, discloses such electronic record, book, register, correspondence, information, document or other material to any other person shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine which may extend to one lakh rupees, or with both.\n\nPublishing false digital signature certificates - Sec.73: No person shall publish a false Electronic Signature Certificate or otherwise make it available to any other person despite knowing the following points: (a). The Certifying Authority listed in the certificate has not issued it; or (b) The subscriber listed in the certificate has not accepted it; or (c) The certificate has been revoked or suspended unless such publication is for the purpose of verifying a digital signature created prior to such suspension or revocation.\n\nIndian websites are literally in a danger zone!\n\nInterested in General Knowledge and Current Affairs?
