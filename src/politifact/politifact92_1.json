        "text": "\n\n\n\n— When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot, it wasn’t unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt.\n\nHe was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show.\n\nWas Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged?\n\nThe answer may never be known, but Castile’s stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile’s girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath.\n\nThe shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile’s killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana.\n\nThe Castile video “is pretty horrific,” said Gavin Kearney, who in 2003 co-authored a report to the Minnesota Legislature on racial profiling in the state. “There are things we don’t know about it. But we know there are certain assumptions and biases — whether explicit or implicit — about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions. And we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over.”\n\nCourt records dating to 2002 show Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors.\n\nMany charges were dismissed, but Castile pleaded guilty to some, mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance. However, those two charges also were the most frequently dismissed, along with failing to wear a seat belt.\n\nThe records show no convictions for more serious crimes.\n\nNo recent information is available on the racial breakdown of drivers stopped or ticketed by police in Falcon Heights, the mostly white suburb where the shooting occurred, or in other Minnesota towns. Minnesota is not among the handful of states that require police to keep such data.\n\nBut in 2001, the Legislature asked for a racial profiling study and it fell to Kearney, then at the Institute on Race & Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law School, to conduct it. His study, using information supplied voluntarily by 65 law enforcement jurisdictions in the state, found a strong likelihood that racial and ethnic bias played a role in traffic stop policies and practices. Overall, officers stopped minority drivers at greater rates than whites and searched them at greater rates, but found contraband in those searches at lower rates than whites.\n\nThe analysis found the pattern was more pronounced in suburban areas. In Fridley, New Hope, Plymouth, Sauk Rapids and Savage combined, blacks were stopped about 310 percent more often than expected.\n\nThe St. Anthony Police Department, which employs the officer who shot Castile, did not participate in the study. St. Anthony officials have not commented on Castile’s stop since shortly after the shooting.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how much money governments in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area generate from traffic violations. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation following the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri, found law enforcement efforts were focused on generating revenue for that city. Most of the tickets and fines were going to blacks.\n\nCastile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him “for no apparent reason” after he reached for his ID.\n\nValerie Castile said she thinks her son “was just black in the wrong place.” Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he did not believe it would have happened to a white motorist.\n\nThe officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino. His lawyer, Thomas Kelly, said Saturday that his client reacted to the fact that Castile had a gun, not his race, though Kelly would not discuss what led Yanez to initiate the traffic stop.\n\n“Police understand the concerns about choices made about who gets stopped and what happens when they get stopped,” said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\n\nBut the statistics can’t simply be attributed to racial bias among police.\n\n“When people call the police, they provide a description of somebody engaged in a crime. The police respond to those descriptions,” said Stephens, a former Charlotte, North Carolina, police chief. “That counts for part of the disproportionality that we see in those numbers.”\n\nLast year, the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended police departments collect and analyze demographic data on all stops, searches and seizures.\n\nNationally, 13 percent of black drivers were pulled over at least once in 2011, compared with 10 percent of the white drivers, according to a survey by the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nThe survey shows 68 percent of black drivers considered the stops legitimate compared with 84 percent of white drivers.\n\nThe precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing.\n\n“Our implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we’re facing ambiguous situations,” Fridell said. “A person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous. If I, as a white, middle-aged woman, reach into my pocket most people aren’t going to experience fear. For a black male with dreadlocks, that ambiguous action would produce fear in many people.”\n\n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Before Friday, the city administrator would have to call a meeting to spend any more than $5,000.00.\n\nWith Friday’s resolution, City Administrator Sack Thongvanh can now spend up to $50,000.00 in the case of an emergency such as a protest.\n\nThey small city of 5,000 people or so will also now have a public affairs consultant because of the international interest in the shooting death of Philando Castile at the hands of police officers.\n\nMembers of Black Lives Matter’s St. Paul chapter were outside the Friday meeting.\n\nLeaders from the St. Paul group of Black Lives Matter and St. Paul NAACP briefly met with Falcon Heights mayor Peter Lindstrom to express their concerns over the St. Anthony Police department.\n\nThey are demanding the city terminate its contract with St. Anthony police, which provides policing for the small neighboring community.\n\nBlack Lives Matter-St. Paul says it is putting together a group of community leaders to discuss policing in Falcon Heights and the mayor intends to join those talks.\n\nBlack Lives Matter St. Paul organizer Rashad Turner said many members of the black community have reported feeling racially profiled along Larpenteur Avenue, in the area where Philando Castile was pulled over, shot and killed on July 6.\n\nThe group said if the city does not figure out another agency to use for officers, the protests will continue.\n\n“We are being continuously pulled over for driving while black, and now it has taken the lives of one of our brothers,” Turner said.\n\nThe group is planning a protest on Saturday but would not reveal any more details as of Friday afternoon.\n\nTurner said he would prefer St. Paul police department take over policing for Falcon Heights even though that department along with Minneapolis police have been the subjects of several BLM protests.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nPolice Fatally Shoot Man During Traffic Stop, Aftermath Video Posted\n\nRamsey Co.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n— Attention from around the world is focused on the investigation into the shooting death of Philando Castile\n\nIt was Wednesday night when Castile, 32, was killed after being pulled over by police in Falcon Heights. Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, made a live broadcast on Facebook after he was shot. In the video, Reynolds calmly describes the confusion over Castile reaching for his license after telling the officer he had a permit to carry a gun.\n\nCastile would have celebrated his 33rd birthday next week. He worked for St. Paul Public Schools as a supervisor in the cafeteria at J.J. Hill Montessori School.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) identified the officers involved in the deadly shooting. They say St. Anthony Police officer Jeronimo Yanez fired the shots.\n\nThe case is now in the hands of the BCA. When the investigation is completed, the BCA will submit their findings to Ramsey County Attorney John Choi, who will determine if and how charges should be filed.\n\n“We want this investigation to be prompt, but at the same time it needs to be thorough and those things can compete against one another, but I think both can be achieved,” he said.\n\nThe Facebook video that more than 5 million people have watched — the video that capture the moments after shooting — that will be part of the evidence.\n\nThe case hinges the law surrounding the use of deadly force, which is only justified if the officer or others are at risk of great bodily harm or death. Choi said prosecuting the case in the state of Minnesota might be a tricky.\n\n“The law in the state of Minnesota gives a lot of protection to police officers,” he said.\n\nAs for a grand jury, Choi says he’s not sure if they’ll use one.\n\n“I think that this is a very extraordinary case,” he said. “This doesn’t happen on a regular basis, and I just need that time to, kind of, think that through.”\n\nChoi said if charges are filed, his office will prosecute the case to the fullest extent of the law.",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n— WCCO is learning more about the officers involved in the shooting of Philando Castile Wednesday night in Falcon Heights.\n\nInvestigators released the names Thursday night of St. Anthony Police Officers Jeronimo Yanez and Joseph Kauser.\n\nYanez is said to have repeatedly shot Castile during a traffic stop.\n\nBoth officers, who are four-year veterans of the department, are on paid administrative leave during the investigation.\n\nYanez graduated from Minnesota State University-Mankato back in 2010, and worked in security-related fields before joining St. Anthony’s department. A search of court records also shows Yanez has no civil suits filed against him.\n\nHe is married and has a young child. Yanez has also been an active member of the Minnesota Chapter of the National Latino Peace Officers’ Association for the last year.\n\nThe association’s public information officer, John Lozoya, says he worked with Yanez on some community service events.\n\n“He loves being a police officer,” Lozoya said. “He has a passion for helping others and that’s why he joined law enforcement.”\n\nYanez’s lawyer, Thomas Kelly, tells WCCO that his client feels incredibly sad for the Castile family and is working with investigators and St. Anthony Police.\n\nThomas says Yanez has no disciplinary action against him during his time with department, and says he is “community oriented and devoted to the police department,” with a “reputation of being a kind and generous man with empathy.”\n\nWCCO requested information on the employment history for both officers from St. Anthony Police.\n\nWe asked questions regarding awards and commendations, as well as any disciplinary action. We also asked for information on whether the officers have ever discharged their weapons or if they worked for other departments in the state.\n\nThe department referred our questions to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.\n\nA BCA spokeswoman said they do not have that information on the officers.\n\nThe union that represents more than 5,000 officers in the state, including the St. Anthony Police Department, released a statement from Law Enforcement Labor Services executive director Sean Gormley.\n\n“The death of Philando Castile is a terrible tragedy for all involved, especially for the family and loved ones of the deceased.\n\nThe video being shown in the media is graphic. It’s emotional. And for some it may be hard to watch.\n\nWe support an open, thorough, and objective investigation that we believe will, in time, provide the answers to the questions we all have.\n\nWe also support the officers’ right to due process. The right of due process is afforded to all Americans.”\n\nRelated Stories\n\nLawyer: Officer Who Shot Castile Reacted To Gun, Not Race\n\nPhilando Castile Had Been Stopped 52 Times By Police\n\nRev.

        "text": "DALLAS (AP) — Supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement on Friday condemned the slayings of police in Dallas but stressed that the shootings should not lessen concerns over the killings of black men and women by officers across the country.\n\n“My heart goes out to the victims of all violence, when we think about what has happened over the past 48 hours,” activist DeRay McKesson said Friday during an appearance on C-SPAN.\n\nAuthorities say snipers killed five Dallas officers and injured seven others Thursday night during a protest over fatal police shootings of black men this week in Louisiana and Minnesota.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter group called the Dallas attack “the result of the actions of a lone gunman.”\n\n“To assign the actions of one person to an entire movement is dangerous and irresponsible. We continue our efforts to bring about a better world for all of us,” the group said in a statement.\n\nPolice officials have identified one suspect, whom they killed but say they’re unsure how many people participated in the attack.\n\nThe shooting in Dallas came as protesters gathered in reaction to the deaths of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nCastile was shot Wednesday while in a car with a woman and a child. The aftermath of the shooting was livestreamed in a Facebook video that has been widely shared on social media and broadcast on TV newscasts. A day earlier, Alton Sterling was shot in Louisiana after being pinned to the pavement by two white officers. That, too, was captured on a cellphone video.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement traces its roots to the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012 and gained national ground after 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. Since then, deaths of other unarmed black males at the hands of law enforcement officers have inspired protests under the Black Lives Matter moniker.\n\n“The movement is bigger than any one person or organization,” McKesson said Friday. “There are so many incredible activists and organizers pushing to make the world more equitable and just.”\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network appeared to strike a critical tone of the movement in a Friday morning media statement that said Sharpton “reaffirms his commitment that the movement must continue but that it must be anti-police misconduct, not anti-police.”\n\nThe group rejected the notion that Black Lives Matter is against police.\n\n“This is a tragedy — both for those who have been impacted by yesterday’s attack and for our democracy,” the group said in a statement. “There are some who would use these events to stifle a movement for change and quicken the demise of a vibrant discourse on the human rights of Black Americans. We should reject all of this.”\n\nThe statement echoes comments from supporters who took to Twitter in the overnight hours to defend the movement.\n\n“#BlackLivesMatter advocates dignity, justice and freedom, not the murder of cops,” wrote Malkia A. Cyril, director of the Center for Media Justice.\n\n“Anyone blaming this Dallas shooting on the #BlackLivesMatter movement is sick,” tweeted New York Daily News columnist Shaun King.\n\n“Those protestors were peaceful. This terrorized them too.”\n\n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.)",

Jesse Jackson met with Diamond Reynolds, Governor Mark Dayton, Lt. Governor Tina Smith and faith leaders.\n\n“I want to thank the governor for a measure of decency and dignity,” Jackson said. “The governor’s statement was heard around the world.”\n\nJackson called the camera “the big eye of justice.” Reynolds live-streamed the moments following the shooting of her boyfriend Philando Castile on Facebook.\n\n“The role that Diamond played describing what happened in real-time has shook the world,” he said.\n\nThe civil rights leader said, over gumbo, he brought the group together to support Reynolds and her 4-year-old daughter.\n\n“The courage you showed and the poise under the horrible adversity — I’m in awe of your courage,” Gov. Dayton told Diamond Reynolds.\n\n“It was so my voice could be heard for the justice of my boyfriend,” she told the governor. “I told him as I viewed him today that I will get justice for him.”\n\nJackson also took his message to people gathered outside the Governor’s mansion, and he said this needs to end with the county attorney charging the officer.\n\n“None of us are above the law, police are not above the law,” Jackson said. “If he’d been sitting in the car and he’d been shot and killed there would already be an arraignment.”\n\nRelated Stories\n\nLawyer: Officer Who Shot Castile Reacted To Gun, Not Race\n\nPhilando Castile Had Been Stopped 52 Times By Police\n\nOfficer Who Shot Philando Castile ‘Incredibly Sad’ For His Family\n\nCo.

He then commended community members who have channeled their feelings into protests.\n\nHe also said that his staff has been working closely with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension on the investigation, which he says is a top priority.\n\nAfter the BCA finishes its investigation, all evidence will be turned over to the Ramsey County Attorney’s Office.\n\nHe has asked for a “prompt and thorough investigation” in Wednesday’s shooting of Castile, and they’ll present the case to the prosecutor’s office. Choi said he thinks there are benefits to using grand juries but will decide later. Whatever is decided, he said it will be based on facts and a truthful pursuit of justice.\n\nChoi also spoke about the video Castile’s girlfriend live streamed after the shooting. He said that video will be part of the evidence.\n\nHe said the Grand Jury or his office will look at everything in order to have the total picture of what happened that night.\n\nProtesters on Thursday urged Choi not to use a grand jury, arguing it’s secretive and lets police officers off the hook.\n\nChoi also asked for peace throughout the U.S. and in protests.\n\nRELATED:Dayton: Castile Wouldn’t Have Been Shot If He Were White\n\nJustice Dept.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n— A suburban Minnesota police officer who killed a black driver reacted to the man’s gun, not his race, his attorney said Saturday, giving the most detailed account so far of why the officer drew his own weapon.\n\nSt. Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez was reacting to “the presence of that gun and the display of that gun” when he opened fire on Philando Castile, Minneapolis attorney Thomas Kelly told The Associated Press. He declined to elaborate on how Castile displayed the weapon or what led up to the deadly traffic stop.\n\nCastile’s girlfriend Diamond Reynolds was in the car and streamed the immediate aftermath of the shooting live on Facebook. She has said Yanez shot Castile several times after he told the officer he had a gun and a permit for it and then reached for his wallet.\n\nYanez “was reacting to the actions of the driver,” Kelly said. “This had nothing to do with race. This had everything to do with the presence of a gun.”\n\nLess than 24 hours after the shooting, Gov. Mark Dayton declared that police likely wouldn’t have fired if Castile had been white. Dayton later said he stood by his statement, even though he angered some in law enforcement.\n\nWhether or not a black man is legally in possession of a gun might not matter in the tense moments of an encounter with an officer, said Philip Smith, president and founder of the National African American Gun Association.\n\n“They’re not getting any kind of the benefit of the doubt,'” Smith said.\n\nKelly said Yanez, who is Latino, is “overcome with sadness” over the shooting in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights, a mostly white community of 5,000 that is served primarily by the nearby St. Anthony Police Department.\n\nYanez and an officer who was with him, Joseph Kauser, were put on administrative leave, as is standard, authorities said. Both are four-year veterans of the St. Anthony force.\n\nYanez’s position with the 23-member department was his first in law enforcement, after jobs in security and doing contract immigration compliance work, Kelly said. The 28-year-old has a wife and child and graduated from Minnesota State University Mankato with a degree in law enforcement in 2010.\n\n“He’s a very sensitive officer, he cares about people,” Kelly said. “He would drive around and stop and talk, and get out of the car, meet people and say hello.”\n\nIn 2014, the department selected Yanez to be part of a special crime prevention unit, whose members were hand-picked based on “their initiative, creativeness and varied backgrounds in law enforcement,” according to the department’s annual report.\n\nAbout the same time, Yanez joined the Minnesota chapter of the National Latino Peace Officers Association, where he worked to raise money for and connect with Latino youth, said John Lozoya, one of the organization’s founders.\n\nLozoya recalled him as an active, passionate and approachable member.\n\n“This man had the well-earned respect of his colleagues,” Kelly said.\n\nYanez is cooperating with state investigators, who interviewed him within 15 hours of the shooting, Kelly said.\n\nSeveral videos, including squad car video, have been collected, though St. Anthony officers don’t wear body cameras, authorities said.\n\nIn the video she streamed on Facebook Live, Reynolds describes being pulled over for what the officer told her was a “busted tail light.” The video shows her in a car next to a bloodied Castile slumped in a seat.\n\nA clearly distraught person who appears to be a police officer stands at the car’s window, tells her to keep her hands up and says: “I told him not to reach for it. I told him to get his hand out.”\n\n“You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir,” Reynolds calmly responds.\n\nCourt records show the traffic stop was at least the 52nd time Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, had been pulled over in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area since 2002.\n\nKelly said the broken tail light wasn’t the only reason for the latest traffic stop, but he would not elaborate.\n\nThe following night, five police officers were fatally shot and others were wounded during protests in Dallas over Castile’s killing and the fatal police shooting of 37-year-old black man Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, after a scuffle with officers outside a convenience store. Authorities identified the Dallas shooter as an Army veteran who was later killed by police.\n\nSterling’s and Castile’s families denounced the attack on the Dallas officers.\n\n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Mark Dayton’s mansion Thursday night to some resembled the scene outside the Minneapolis Police Department’s 4th precinct last fall.\n\nThe demonstrations were in response to the death of 32-year-old Philando Castile, who was shot to death during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights. The aftermath of his shooting was broadcast on Facebook by his girlfriend.\n\nLike the protests that arose following the death of Jamar Clark, the demonstration was organized with tents, tables, bottles of water and boxes of snacks.\n\nNeighborhood resident Tim O’Brien said he spent Thursday morning sitting by himself in the middle of Summit Avenue directly in front of the mansion’s main gate.\n\n“I think it’s absolutely appropriate,” he said. “We have to shift things, and they’re not shifting from the top.”\n\nO’Brien said that there was support for the protests from other residents in the neighborhood.\n\n“I stood with a neighbor last night and he’s in complete solidarity with us,” O’Brien said. “I haven’t talked with anyone that’s disagreed with what’s going on here.”\n\nPolice widened the area of Summit Avenue that’s blocked from traffic.

        "text": "\n\n\n\nGov. Mark Dayton is urging Minnesotans to remain calm while the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigates the fatal shooting of a man by police in Falcon Heights.\n\nPhilando Castile, 32, was shot and killed by a St. Anthony police officer during a traffic stop Wednesday.\n\nIn a press conference Friday afternoon, Dayton asked Minnesotans for “calm and understanding in this difficult time.”\n\n“We’ll get through this terrible time here in Minnesota,” he said.\n\nSome criticized Dayton after he made comments suggesting Castile would not have been shot if he had been white.\n\nDayton did not take back those comments.\n\n“I stand by what I said yesterday,” said Dayton. “I don’t have any new information … I’m judging based on the evidence I have.”\n\nHe also said he did not think those comments would influence the BCA’s investigation.\n\nThe governor expressed condolences for the officers shot in Dallas Thursday evening and asked Minnesotans to remain calm during the BCA’s investigation.\n\n“It underscored the need for us to not react violently, to react nonviolently to this very, very difficult situation,” Dayton said.\n\n“I intend to follow the law,” Dayton said, “and that’s what I ask our citizens to do.”\n\nIn the coming days, Dayton is set to meet with law enforcement and civil rights leaders to create a plan moving forward.\n\n“I want to get the input, the recommendations from people who are on the front lines,” Dayton said. “This is really going to have to happen at the community level.”\n\nDayton also asked for patience while the investigation takes place. He said he did not know the timeline for the investigation’s completion.\n\n“I’d like to see it happen as quickly as possible,” he said. “I know that they [the BCA] know that this is an absolute top priority.”\n\nProtesters marched to Dayton’s mansion following Castile’s death. While the protest was peaceful for the most part, one group that splintered off from those at the governor’s mansion did damage a police car and the window of a business.\n\n“I’m grateful to everyone involved in peaceful protest,” Dayton said, adding “I view [the splintered group] as a separate matter and not representative of the group as a whole.”\n\nDayton closed the press conference by asking the question that everyone wants answered.\n\n“Why did this happen?” said Dayton. “I want to see justice served.”",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n— A 32-year-old man has died after an officer-involved shooting Wednesday night in Falcon Heights.\n\nPhilando Castile’s mother, Valerie Castile, says he died at Hennepin County Medical Center just before 9:40 p.m.\n\nSt. Anthony Police said in a press release that officers pulled over a vehicle at Larpenteur Avenue and Fry Street at about 9 p.m. They said “shots were fired” during the traffic stop, and a handgun was recovered at the scene. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is investigating.\n\nWARNING: Video Contains Disturbing Images And Audio\n\nCastile’s family says his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, and her 4-year-old daughter were in the car at the time. Reynolds was taken into custody Wednesday night.\n\nThe video above, filmed by Reynolds under the Facebook account for Lavish Reynolds, began circulating on Facebook shortly after the shooting, but was pulled from the site before midnight.\n\nReynolds, who was in the front passenger seat, says in the video that they were pulled over for a broken tail light. She says police asked Castile, who was driving, for his license and registration.\n\nShe says as Castile was reaching for his wallet, he informed officers that he had a firearm in his possession, and a conceal-and-carry permit.\n\nReynolds says in the video that an officer then shot her boyfriend four times.\n\nThe officer in the video at one point screams, “I told him not to reach for it! I told him to get his hand out …”\n\nReynolds tells the officer, “You told him to get his I.D., sir, his driver’s license.”\n\nShe pans the cellphone camera over Castile, who is covered in blood.\n\n“Oh my God, please don’t tell me he’s dead. Please don’t tell me my boyfriend just went like that,” Reynolds said.\n\nThe officer, whose gun is drawn the entire time, tells Reynolds to, “Keep your hands where they are.”\n\n“Yes I will, sir, I’ll keep my hands where they are,” she said.\n\nReynolds is then told to get out of the car. Her cellphone shows several officers with guns drawn, and one officer holding her daughter, who was in the back seat of the car when Castile was shot.\n\nValerie Castile told WCCO that her son was a cafeteria supervisor at J.J. Hill Montessori School in St. Paul. He would have turned 33 on July 16.\n\nSgt. Jon Mangseth, St. Anthony Police’s interim chief, told reporters late Wednesday night that he was aware of the Facebook video, but not of its content.\n\n“[We haven’t had an] officer-involved shooting in, you know, 30 years or more. I’d have to go back in the history books, to tell you the truth,” Mangseth said.\n\nHe later stated in a brief press conference early Thursday morning that the officer who shot Castile has been placed on standard paid administrative leave.\n\nThe St. Anthony Police Department provides police services for the neighboring cities of Falcon Heights and Lauderdale.\n\nCastile’s family and friends gathered at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis late Wednesday night, and were later joined by Minneapolis NAACP President Nekima Levy-Pounds and other community activists.\n\nAn estimated 200 people were gathered at the shooting site in Falcon Heights at 1:30 a.m. Police started towing cars soon after, and most people left by 2:30 a.m.\n\nProtesters then began to gather at the Governor’s Mansion in St. Paul after 2 a.m.\n\n——-\n\nBelow is a transcript of Reynolds’ Facebook video.\n\n——-\n\nReynolds: Stay with me. We got pulled over for a busted tail light in the back and he’s covered … they killed my boyfriend. He’s licensed to carry. He was trying to get out his ID and his wallet out his pocket and he let the officer know that he had a firearm and he was reaching for his wallet and the officer just shot him in his arm.\n\nOfficer: Ma’am, keep your hands where they are.\n\nReynolds: I am sir, no worries.\n\nOfficer: [Yells expletive.]\n\nReynolds: He just got his arm shot off. We got pulled over on Larpenteur.\n\nOfficer: I told him not to reach for it! I told him to get his head up!\n\nReynolds: He had, you told him to get his ID, sir, his driver’s license. Please don’t tell me he’s dead.\n\nOfficer: [Expletive.]\n\nReynolds: Please don’t tell me my boyfriend just went like that.\n\nOfficer: Keep your hands where they are.\n\nReynolds: Yes I will, sir. I will keep my hands where they are. Please don’t tell me that he’s gone. Please don’t tell me that he’s gone. Please officer, don’t tell me that you just did this to him. You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir.\n\n[Silence]\n\nOther Officer: Get the female passenger out of the car.\n\nReynolds: Where’s my daughter? You have my daughter?”\n\n[Five Minutes Later]\n\nReynolds: I got … the Roseville Police got me handcuffed, my phone is about to die. I’m on Larpenteur and Fry and the Roseville Police Department just shot my boyfriend. They shot him four times. He has a license to carry. We had a busted tail light. And we had some weed in the car that’s about it.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nLawyer: Officer Who Shot Castile Reacted To Gun, Not Race\n\nPhilando Castile Had Been Stopped 52 Times By Police\n\nOfficer Who Shot Philando Castile ‘Incredibly Sad’ For His Family\n\nRev.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — One man told an officer during a Minnesota traffic stop that he was a licensed gun owner, and that he was reaching for his wallet, a witness said. The other was on the ground with police officers on top of him in Louisiana when someone shouted “He has a gun!”\n\nPolice in each circumstance thought the black man carrying a gun was dangerous and immediately shot him dead. Activists say black gun owners are often treated differently than white gun owners to a sometimes fatal degree.\n\nThe perception of an armed black person has not changed much since the days of slave rebellions, said the Rev. Kenn Blanchard, a former firearms instructor who runs BlackManWithAGun.com.\n\n“If you have a firearm or you scare the wrong people, you’re going to get shot. You’re going to get killed. The perception of the scary black man still exists. The threat of the slave going rogue, it’s still there. The bad gangbanger,” Blanchard said.\n\nSnipers opened fire on police officers in the heart of Dallas, Thursday evening, killing five officers and injuring six others during protests over two recent fatal police shootings of black men, according to police.\n\nThe gunfire broke while hundreds of people were gathered to protest fatal police shootings this week in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and suburban St. Paul, Minnesota. Protests were also held in several other cities across the country after a Minnesota officer on Wednesday fatally shot Philando Castile while he was in a car with a woman and a child. The aftermath of the shooting was livestreamed in a widely shared Facebook video. A day earlier, Alton Sterling was shot in Louisiana after being pinned to the pavement by two white officers. That, too, was captured on a cellphone video.\n\nCastile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, said he told the officer during a traffic stop that he was carrying a gun for which he was licensed. Castile did “nothing but what the police officer asked of us, which was to put your hands in the air and get your license and registration,” she said.\n\nOn a video purporting to show the aftermath, the officer tells her: “I told him not to reach for it. I told him to get his hand out.”\n\n“You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir,” the woman responds.\n\nThis all comes during a discussion in the United States about the killing of black men and women by police officers after the deaths of Travyon Martin in Florida, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Freddy Gray in Baltimore. Their deaths have inspired nationwide protests under the “Black Lives Matter” moniker including protests this week over the deaths of Castile and Sterling.\n\n“Would this have happened if those passengers would have been white? I don’t think it would have,” Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said.\n\n“We have seen tragedies like this too many times,” President Barack Obama said Thursday. When incidents like this occur, many Americans feel it’s because they’re not being treated the same, Obama said. “That hurts.”\n\nIt can be dangerous for black men and women to own guns in this policing environment, and it shouldn’t be, considering that gun ownership is a constitutional right, said Philip Smith, president and founder of National African American Gun Association.\n\nSterling was a convicted felon, which would have barred him from legally carrying a gun, according to court records. It was not immediately known whether the gun held by Castile was legal.\n\nThat information might not have mattered during their confrontations with police, Smith said.\n\n“They’re not getting any kind of the benefit of the doubt. There’s no conversation. If there is a conversation, it’s a one-way conversation where the African-American male is being yelled at, pretty much, ‘Sit down and be quiet or you’re going to get shot,’ ” Smith said.\n\nMessages left for the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the National Rifle Association were not immediately returned.\n\nThe first gun-control laws were passed to keep weapons out of the hands of black slaves and freedmen in colonial days, said Nicholas J. Johnson, a Fordham University law professor and author of “Negroes and The Gun: The Black Tradition of Arms.” During the post-Civil War period and the times of slavery, Southern states imposed strict gun laws against blacks that lasted through the civil rights movement.\n\nPolice have an outsized fear of armed blacks, activists said. The majority of blacks are not armed and the majority of killers of police officers are white. The FBI said 199 law enforcement officers were killed between 2011 and 2014. Of their killers, 133 were white and 70 were black.\n\nBlacks also are only about half as likely as whites to have a firearm in their home — 41 percent vs. 19 percent — according to a 2014 Pew Research Center survey.\n\nBut another Pew survey showed more and more blacks becoming comfortable with owning guns, with 54 percent saying in 2014 that gun ownership does more to protect people than endanger personal safety, nearly double the 29 percent from December 2012.\n\n“Historically, African-Americans have viewed guns kind of like the boogeyman — ‘The master told you not to look at the gun and we shouldn’t touch a gun,'” Smith said. “But that mindset is changing very, very quickly.”\n\n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Both have been with the St. Anthony Police Department for four years, and both are on the standard administrative leave.\n\nInvestigators with the BCA say they’re reviewing squad car video of the shooting, and will be interviewing witnesses. St. Anthony Police Officers don’t wear body cameras. Once the investigation is complete, the BCA will submit its findings to the Ramsey County Attorney “without recommendation.”\n\nAccording to the press release, officers Yanez and Kauser conducted a traffic stop at 9:05 p.m. Wednesday night near Larpenter Avenue West and Fry Street. Officer Yanez approached the driver’s side, where Castile was sitting, and Officer Kauser approached the passenger side, where Diamond Reynolds was sitting.\n\nAt one point in the stop, BCA officials say Officer Yanez fired his weapon multiple times, striking Castile. Reynolds then streamed the aftermath live on Facebook, which quickly went viral.\n\nOfficer Yanez called for an ambulance on his radio, according to the BCA report. Authorities from the Roseville Police Department and St. Paul Fire Department soon arrived and performed CPR on Castile before the medical response team arrived. An ambulance then brought Castile to Hennepin County Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nThe BCA says other law enforcement officers brought Reynolds and her daughter to the Roseville Police Department, where she provided a statement to investigators about the incident. In her Facebook Live video of the aftermath of the shooting, Reynolds said she was handcuffed in the back of a Roseville Police squad car. The BCA says Roseville Police officers drove her home after she provided her statement.",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n— When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot, it wasn’t unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt.\n\nHe was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show.\n\nWas Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged?\n\nThe answer may never be known, but Castile’s stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile’s girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath.\n\nThe shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile’s killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana.\n\nThe Castile video “is pretty horrific,” said Gavin Kearney, who in 2003 co-authored a report to the Minnesota Legislature on racial profiling in the state. “There are things we don’t know about it. But we know there are certain assumptions and biases — whether explicit or implicit — about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions. And we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over.”\n\nCourt records dating to 2002 show Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors.\n\nMany charges were dismissed, but Castile pleaded guilty to some, mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance. However, those two charges also were the most frequently dismissed, along with failing to wear a seat belt.\n\nThe records show no convictions for more serious crimes.\n\nNo recent information is available on the racial breakdown of drivers stopped or ticketed by police in Falcon Heights, the mostly white suburb where the shooting occurred, or in other Minnesota towns. Minnesota is not among the handful of states that require police to keep such data.\n\nBut in 2001, the Legislature asked for a racial profiling study and it fell to Kearney, then at the Institute on Race & Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law School, to conduct it. His study, using information supplied voluntarily by 65 law enforcement jurisdictions in the state, found a strong likelihood that racial and ethnic bias played a role in traffic stop policies and practices. Overall, officers stopped minority drivers at greater rates than whites and searched them at greater rates, but found contraband in those searches at lower rates than whites.\n\nThe analysis found the pattern was more pronounced in suburban areas. In Fridley, New Hope, Plymouth, Sauk Rapids and Savage combined, blacks were stopped about 310 percent more often than expected.\n\nThe St. Anthony Police Department, which employs the officer who shot Castile, did not participate in the study. St. Anthony officials have not commented on Castile’s stop since shortly after the shooting.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how much money governments in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area generate from traffic violations. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation following the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri, found law enforcement efforts were focused on generating revenue for that city. Most of the tickets and fines were going to blacks.\n\nCastile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him “for no apparent reason” after he reached for his ID.\n\nValerie Castile said she thinks her son “was just black in the wrong place.” Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he did not believe it would have happened to a white motorist.\n\nThe officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino. His lawyer, Thomas Kelly, said Saturday that his client reacted to the fact that Castile had a gun, not his race, though Kelly would not discuss what led Yanez to initiate the traffic stop.\n\n“Police understand the concerns about choices made about who gets stopped and what happens when they get stopped,” said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\n\nBut the statistics can’t simply be attributed to racial bias among police.\n\n“When people call the police, they provide a description of somebody engaged in a crime. The police respond to those descriptions,” said Stephens, a former Charlotte, North Carolina, police chief. “That counts for part of the disproportionality that we see in those numbers.”\n\nLast year, the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended police departments collect and analyze demographic data on all stops, searches and seizures.\n\nNationally, 13 percent of black drivers were pulled over at least once in 2011, compared with 10 percent of the white drivers, according to a survey by the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nThe survey shows 68 percent of black drivers considered the stops legitimate compared with 84 percent of white drivers.\n\nThe precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing.\n\n“Our implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we’re facing ambiguous situations,” Fridell said. “A person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous. If I, as a white, middle-aged woman, reach into my pocket most people aren’t going to experience fear. For a black male with dreadlocks, that ambiguous action would produce fear in many people.”\n\n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n— When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot, it wasn’t unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt.\n\nHe was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show.\n\nWas Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged?\n\nThe answer may never be known, but Castile’s stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile’s girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath.\n\nThe shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile’s killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana.\n\nThe Castile video “is pretty horrific,” said Gavin Kearney, who in 2003 co-authored a report to the Minnesota Legislature on racial profiling in the state. “There are things we don’t know about it. But we know there are certain assumptions and biases — whether explicit or implicit — about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions. And we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over.”\n\nCourt records dating to 2002 show Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors.\n\nMany charges were dismissed, but Castile pleaded guilty to some, mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance. However, those two charges also were the most frequently dismissed, along with failing to wear a seat belt.\n\nThe records show no convictions for more serious crimes.\n\nNo recent information is available on the racial breakdown of drivers stopped or ticketed by police in Falcon Heights, the mostly white suburb where the shooting occurred, or in other Minnesota towns. Minnesota is not among the handful of states that require police to keep such data.\n\nBut in 2001, the Legislature asked for a racial profiling study and it fell to Kearney, then at the Institute on Race & Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law School, to conduct it. His study, using information supplied voluntarily by 65 law enforcement jurisdictions in the state, found a strong likelihood that racial and ethnic bias played a role in traffic stop policies and practices. Overall, officers stopped minority drivers at greater rates than whites and searched them at greater rates, but found contraband in those searches at lower rates than whites.\n\nThe analysis found the pattern was more pronounced in suburban areas. In Fridley, New Hope, Plymouth, Sauk Rapids and Savage combined, blacks were stopped about 310 percent more often than expected.\n\nThe St. Anthony Police Department, which employs the officer who shot Castile, did not participate in the study. St. Anthony officials have not commented on Castile’s stop since shortly after the shooting.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how much money governments in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area generate from traffic violations. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation following the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri, found law enforcement efforts were focused on generating revenue for that city. Most of the tickets and fines were going to blacks.\n\nCastile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him “for no apparent reason” after he reached for his ID.\n\nValerie Castile said she thinks her son “was just black in the wrong place.” Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he did not believe it would have happened to a white motorist.\n\nThe officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino.

        "text": "\n\n\n\nMinnesota Gov. Mark Dayton says he doesn’t think a police officer would have shot and killed a driver who apparently was pulled over for a broken taillight if the driver had been white instead of black.\n\nDayton is calling for a federal investigation into the death of Philando Castile.\n\n“We’re shocked and horrified by what we heard last night,” Dayton said. “I will do everything in my power to make sure it’s investigated.”\n\nDayton said Thursday afternoon at a news conference in St. Paul that he thinks the police response was “way over” what was called for when the officer shot Castile several times as he sat in his car Wednesday in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights.\n\nDayton, a Democrat, says nobody should be killed for a broken taillight or while sitting in their car and that he was “deeply, deeply offended” by Castile’s death.\n\n“The start treatment I find absolutely appalling,” Dayton said, “at all levels.”\n\nPreviously Thursday morning, Dayton called the shooting a “senseless tragedy,” as protesters assembled outside the Governor’s Mansion in St. Paul, calling for action.\n\nRELATED: Police Fatally Shoot Man During Traffic Stop, Aftermath Video Posted\n\n“I extend my deepest condolences to the family, friends, and community of Philando Castile. Our state today grieves with them,” Dayton said. “Overnight, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension began an independent investigation at the state level. They are currently collecting all necessary evidence, and interviewing witnesses, to determine what happened, and to assure that justice in this case is served. I will do everything in my power to help protect the integrity of that investigation, to ensure a proper and just outcome for all involved.”\n\nFederal officials said they would be monitoring the BCA’s investigation. Earlier in the day, FBI Director James Comey said he expects the FBI to be involved in the case.\n\nThe shooting happened late Wednesday during a traffic stop in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights. A woman shared alleged video of the aftermath of the shooting and shared it on Facebook, where it quickly went viral.\n\nIn the video, the woman describes being pulled over for a “busted tail light” and says her boyfriend had told the officer he was carrying a gun for which he was licensed. She says he was shot as he reached for his wallet.\n\nRELATED: Congresswoman McCollum Calls For Investigation In Falcon Heights Shooting\n\nPolice did not release any details about the officer who fired except to say he had been placed on paid administrative leave.\n\nLt. Gov. Tina Smith also commented on Castile’s death: “I grieve for Philando Castile, his family, friends, and community, and especially the child, who was in the car with him. I pray for everyone touched by this tragedy, including our law enforcement officers.”\n\n(TM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

In March, the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office declined to seek charges against the two officers involved in that case.\n\nGov. Mark Dayton said Thursday that the BCA has already started its investigation into Castile’s death. While the governor called earlier for another investigation to be done by the U.S. Department of Justice, he clarified in an afternoon press conference that federal authorities will, for the time being, monitor the BCA’s investigation.\n\nCastile was fatally shot late Wednesday night by a police officer in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul, while his girlfriend and her child were in the car.\n\nCastile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, captured the aftermath of the shooting in a Facebook Live video, in which she says the officer had shot her boyfriend “for no apparent reason.” She added that Castile told the officer he was armed and was reaching for his wallet and registration when the officer shot him four times.\n\nThe video spread rapidly on social media, sparking outrage. The ACLU praised Reynolds for her courage in posting the grim moments after the shooting to Facebook.\n\nCastile, of St. Paul, was a cafeteria worker at J.J. Hill Montessori School. He was 32.\n\n",

Mark Dayton called for the Justice Department to do an independent investigation into the shooting, but, at an afternoon press conference, the governor clarified that the Justice Department’s role in the case will be to follow the BCA in the investigation unless circumstances prompt them to take the lead.\n\nThis is different than what is happening following the fatal police shooting of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. There, the Justice Department is taking on the investigation in a move to keep tensions from boiling over.\n\nAlready, some in Minnesota are upset that the Justice Department, or another agency, isn’t being tapped to investigate Castile’s death.\n\nThe Minnesota chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union released a statement saying that the BCA should not be the entity at the head of the investigation, adding that it’s proven recently it can’t be trusted to do a thorough and objective investigation.\n\nLast year, the BCA headed the investigation into the fatal police shooting of Jamar Clark in north Minneapolis. In March, the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office declined to pursue charges against the two officers involved.\n\nCastile, 32, died late Wednesday night after he was shot in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul, while in a car with his girlfriend and her child.

Castile was alive and can be seen writhing in the seat next to Reynolds at the start of the video. He was later declared dead at a hospital. Reynolds said her 4-year-old daughter was in the vehicle at the time of the shooting.\n\nHere is a transcript of the video:\n\nReynolds:\n\n“Stay with me. We got pulled over for a busted tail light in the back and the police just, he’s covered. He killed my boyfriend. He’s licensed, he’s carried … he’s licensed to carry. He was trying to get out his ID and his wallet out his pocket and he let the officer know that he was … he had a firearm and he was reaching for his wallet, and the officer just shot him in his arm.”\n\nOfficer with gun pointed at vehicle’s interior:\n\n“F—! I told him not to reach for it, I told him to get his hand out.”\n\nReynolds:\n\n“You told him to get his ID sir, his driver’s license. Oh my God, please don’t tell me he’s dead. Please don’t tell me my boyfriend just went like that.”\n\nOfficer:\n\n“Keep your hands where they are!”\n\nReynolds:\n\n“Yes I will sir. I’ll keep my hands were they are. Please don’t tell me this, Lord. Please Jesus, don’t tell me that he’s gone. Please don’t tell me that he’s gone. Please officer don’t tell me that you just did this to him. You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir.”\n\nOfficer with gun to second officer (shouting):\n\n“Get the female passenger out!”\n\nSecond officer (shouting):\n\n“Ma’am, exit the car right now with your hands up! Let me see your hands. Exit now! Keep ’em up! Keep ’em up!”\n\nReynolds:\n\n“Where’s my daughter? You got my daughter?”\n\nSecond officer:\n\n“Face away from me and walk backwards. Walk backwards. Keep walking. Keep walking. Keep walking. Keep walking. Get on your knees. Get on your knees.”\n\nArresting officer:\n\n“Ma’am, you’re just being detained right now until we get this all sorted out, OK?”\n\nReynolds:\n\n“They threw my phone, Facebook. Please don’t tell me, please don’t tell me my boyfriend is gone. Please don’t tell me he’s gone. Please Jesus, no. Please, no. Please, no. Don’t let him be gone, Lord.”\n\n(A male can be heard repeatedly swearing off camera.)\n\nReynolds (crying):\n\n“It was in his wallet, his license and registration. You told him to get it, sir. You told him. He tried to tell you he was licensed to carry and he was going to take it off. Please don’t tell me my boyfriend’s gone. He don’t deserve this, please. He’s a good man. He works for St. Paul Public Schools. He doesn’t have no records of anything. He’s never been to jail, anything. He’s not a gang member, anything.”\n\n(More from Reynolds, muffled).\n\nOfficer (talking to child):\n\n“Would you stand right here sweetie? I’m just going to put …”\n\nGirl:\n\n“I wanna get my mommy’s purse.”\n\nOfficer:\n\n“I’ll take care of that, OK? Can you just stand right here for me?”\n\nReynolds to daughter:\n\n“Come here, Daedae.”\n\nReynolds (speaking from squad car):\n\n“We in the back seat of the police car. Phil’s sister, call me. The police just shot my boyfriend for no apparent reason. My phone is about to die. They shot him. He shot him three times because we had a busted tail light. He asked them for license and registration. He told that man that it was in his wallet, but he had a pistol on him because he’s licensed to carry, and the officer told him don’t move, and as he was putting his hands back up, the officer shot him in his arm about four or five times. I’m on Larpenteur and Fry. Whoever can come to Larpenteur and Fry, that’s where I’m at. I’m going to need a ride home. We is on Larpenteur and Fry. (Name), if you can come to Larpenteur and Fry, we right here in Roseville. They got the Roseville police, they got me handcuffed. My phone is about to die. I’m on Larpenteur and Fry. The Roseville Police Department just shot my boyfriend. They shot him four times. He’s licensed to carry. We had a busted tail light, and we had some weed in the car, that’s about it.\n\n“It was a Chinese police officer that shot him. He’s Chinese, he’s about five-five, five-six-and-a-half, heavy-set guy. He asked him for his license and registration, which was in the back of his pocket because he keeps his wallet in his pocket. And as he went to reach, he let the officer know before he was reaching that he had a firearm on him, and before he can let the officer know anything, the officer took off shots. About four of five rounds was shot, and my boyfriend, I don’t know what condition he’s in. I don’t know if he’s OK or if he’s not OK. I’m in the backseat of the police hand car, in the back seat of the police car, handcuffed. I need a ride. I’m on Larpenteur and Fry. They got machine guns pointed.”\n\nGirl:\n\n“I’m scared, mommy.”\n\nReynolds:\n\n“Don’t be scared. My daughter just witnessed this. The police just shot him for no apparent reason. No reason at all. They asked for license and registration. That’s the police officer over there that did it, with the black on. I can’t really do s— because they got me handcuffed.”\n\nGirl:\n\n“That’s OK, mommy.”\n\nReynolds:\n\n“I can’t believe that they just did this, I’m f—ing … (Sobbing, shouting) ”\n\nGirl:\n\n“It’s OK, I’m right here with you.”\n\nReynolds (crying):\n\n“Ya’ll please pray for us, Jesus, please ya’ll. I ask everybody on Facebook, everybody that’s watching, everybody that’s tuned in, please pray for us. Sister, I know I just dropped you off, but I need to be picked up. I need Alizay to call my phone.”\n\n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.)",

        "authors": [],
        "publisher": "minnesota.cbslocal.com",
        "publish_date": "2016-07-09",
        "text": "\n\n\n\n— When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot, it wasn’t unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt.\n\nHe was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show.\n\nWas Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged?\n\nThe answer may never be known, but Castile’s stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile’s girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath.\n\nThe shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile’s killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana.\n\nThe Castile video “is pretty horrific,” said Gavin Kearney, who in 2003 co-authored a report to the Minnesota Legislature on racial profiling in the state. “There are things we don’t know about it. But we know there are certain assumptions and biases — whether explicit or implicit — about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions. And we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over.”\n\nCourt records dating to 2002 show Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors.\n\nMany charges were dismissed, but Castile pleaded guilty to some, mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance. However, those two charges also were the most frequently dismissed, along with failing to wear a seat belt.\n\nThe records show no convictions for more serious crimes.\n\nNo recent information is available on the racial breakdown of drivers stopped or ticketed by police in Falcon Heights, the mostly white suburb where the shooting occurred, or in other Minnesota towns. Minnesota is not among the handful of states that require police to keep such data.\n\nBut in 2001, the Legislature asked for a racial profiling study and it fell to Kearney, then at the Institute on Race & Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law School, to conduct it. His study, using information supplied voluntarily by 65 law enforcement jurisdictions in the state, found a strong likelihood that racial and ethnic bias played a role in traffic stop policies and practices. Overall, officers stopped minority drivers at greater rates than whites and searched them at greater rates, but found contraband in those searches at lower rates than whites.\n\nThe analysis found the pattern was more pronounced in suburban areas. In Fridley, New Hope, Plymouth, Sauk Rapids and Savage combined, blacks were stopped about 310 percent more often than expected.\n\nThe St. Anthony Police Department, which employs the officer who shot Castile, did not participate in the study. St. Anthony officials have not commented on Castile’s stop since shortly after the shooting.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how much money governments in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area generate from traffic violations. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation following the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri, found law enforcement efforts were focused on generating revenue for that city. Most of the tickets and fines were going to blacks.\n\nCastile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him “for no apparent reason” after he reached for his ID.\n\nValerie Castile said she thinks her son “was just black in the wrong place.” Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he did not believe it would have happened to a white motorist.\n\nThe officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino. His lawyer, Thomas Kelly, said Saturday that his client reacted to the fact that Castile had a gun, not his race, though Kelly would not discuss what led Yanez to initiate the traffic stop.\n\n“Police understand the concerns about choices made about who gets stopped and what happens when they get stopped,” said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\n\nBut the statistics can’t simply be attributed to racial bias among police.\n\n“When people call the police, they provide a description of somebody engaged in a crime. The police respond to those descriptions,” said Stephens, a former Charlotte, North Carolina, police chief. “That counts for part of the disproportionality that we see in those numbers.”\n\nLast year, the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended police departments collect and analyze demographic data on all stops, searches and seizures.\n\nNationally, 13 percent of black drivers were pulled over at least once in 2011, compared with 10 percent of the white drivers, according to a survey by the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nThe survey shows 68 percent of black drivers considered the stops legitimate compared with 84 percent of white drivers.\n\nThe precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing.\n\n“Our implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we’re facing ambiguous situations,” Fridell said. “A person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous.

If you get in your car, it might be the last time I see you.”\n\nOn Tuesday in Louisiana, a black man was shot by police. A day later in Minnesota, another black man was shot dead by an officer.\n\nThen, five police officers were shot and killed during a protest in Dallas on Thursday.\n\nWilliams says “obviously, violence is not the answer of solving it.” She calls the Dallas shootings “very sad.”\n\n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Mark Dayton says he doesn’t think a police officer would have shot and killed a driver who apparently was pulled over for a broken taillight if the driver had been white instead of black.\n\nDayton is calling for a federal investigation into the death of Philando Castile.\n\n“We’re shocked and horrified by what we heard last night,” Dayton said. “I will do everything in my power to make sure it’s investigated.”\n\nDayton said Thursday afternoon at a news conference in St. Paul that he thinks the police response was “way over” what was called for when the officer shot Castile several times as he sat in his car Wednesday in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights.\n\nDayton, a Democrat, says nobody should be killed for a broken taillight or while sitting in their car and that he was “deeply, deeply offended” by Castile’s death.\n\n“The start treatment I find absolutely appalling,” Dayton said, “at all levels.”\n\nPreviously Thursday morning, Dayton called the shooting a “senseless tragedy,” as protesters assembled outside the Governor’s Mansion in St. Paul, calling for action.\n\nRELATED: Police Fatally Shoot Man During Traffic Stop, Aftermath Video Posted\n\n“I extend my deepest condolences to the family, friends, and community of Philando Castile. Our state today grieves with them,” Dayton said. “Overnight, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension began an independent investigation at the state level. They are currently collecting all necessary evidence, and interviewing witnesses, to determine what happened, and to assure that justice in this case is served. I will do everything in my power to help protect the integrity of that investigation, to ensure a proper and just outcome for all involved.”\n\nFederal officials said they would be monitoring the BCA’s investigation. Earlier in the day, FBI Director James Comey said he expects the FBI to be involved in the case.\n\nThe shooting happened late Wednesday during a traffic stop in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights. A woman shared alleged video of the aftermath of the shooting and shared it on Facebook, where it quickly went viral.\n\nIn the video, the woman describes being pulled over for a “busted tail light” and says her boyfriend had told the officer he was carrying a gun for which he was licensed. She says he was shot as he reached for his wallet.\n\nRELATED: Congresswoman McCollum Calls For Investigation In Falcon Heights Shooting\n\nPolice did not release any details about the officer who fired except to say he had been placed on paid administrative leave.\n\nLt. Gov. Tina Smith also commented on Castile’s death: “I grieve for Philando Castile, his family, friends, and community, and especially the child, who was in the car with him. I pray for everyone touched by this tragedy, including our law enforcement officers.”\n\n(TM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

        "authors": [],
        "publisher": "minnesota.cbslocal.com",
        "publish_date": "2016-07-09",
        "text": "\n\n\n\n— When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot, it wasn’t unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt.\n\nHe was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show.\n\nWas Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged?\n\nThe answer may never be known, but Castile’s stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile’s girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath.\n\nThe shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile’s killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana.\n\nThe Castile video “is pretty horrific,” said Gavin Kearney, who in 2003 co-authored a report to the Minnesota Legislature on racial profiling in the state. “There are things we don’t know about it. But we know there are certain assumptions and biases — whether explicit or implicit — about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions. And we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over.”\n\nCourt records dating to 2002 show Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors.\n\nMany charges were dismissed, but Castile pleaded guilty to some, mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance. However, those two charges also were the most frequently dismissed, along with failing to wear a seat belt.\n\nThe records show no convictions for more serious crimes.\n\nNo recent information is available on the racial breakdown of drivers stopped or ticketed by police in Falcon Heights, the mostly white suburb where the shooting occurred, or in other Minnesota towns. Minnesota is not among the handful of states that require police to keep such data.\n\nBut in 2001, the Legislature asked for a racial profiling study and it fell to Kearney, then at the Institute on Race & Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law School, to conduct it. His study, using information supplied voluntarily by 65 law enforcement jurisdictions in the state, found a strong likelihood that racial and ethnic bias played a role in traffic stop policies and practices. Overall, officers stopped minority drivers at greater rates than whites and searched them at greater rates, but found contraband in those searches at lower rates than whites.\n\nThe analysis found the pattern was more pronounced in suburban areas. In Fridley, New Hope, Plymouth, Sauk Rapids and Savage combined, blacks were stopped about 310 percent more often than expected.\n\nThe St. Anthony Police Department, which employs the officer who shot Castile, did not participate in the study. St. Anthony officials have not commented on Castile’s stop since shortly after the shooting.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how much money governments in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area generate from traffic violations. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation following the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri, found law enforcement efforts were focused on generating revenue for that city. Most of the tickets and fines were going to blacks.\n\nCastile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him “for no apparent reason” after he reached for his ID.\n\nValerie Castile said she thinks her son “was just black in the wrong place.” Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he did not believe it would have happened to a white motorist.\n\nThe officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino. His lawyer, Thomas Kelly, said Saturday that his client reacted to the fact that Castile had a gun, not his race, though Kelly would not discuss what led Yanez to initiate the traffic stop.\n\n“Police understand the concerns about choices made about who gets stopped and what happens when they get stopped,” said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\n\nBut the statistics can’t simply be attributed to racial bias among police.\n\n“When people call the police, they provide a description of somebody engaged in a crime. The police respond to those descriptions,” said Stephens, a former Charlotte, North Carolina, police chief. “That counts for part of the disproportionality that we see in those numbers.”\n\nLast year, the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended police departments collect and analyze demographic data on all stops, searches and seizures.\n\nNationally, 13 percent of black drivers were pulled over at least once in 2011, compared with 10 percent of the white drivers, according to a survey by the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nThe survey shows 68 percent of black drivers considered the stops legitimate compared with 84 percent of white drivers.\n\nThe precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing.\n\n“Our implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we’re facing ambiguous situations,” Fridell said. “A person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous. If I, as a white, middle-aged woman, reach into my pocket most people aren’t going to experience fear. For a black male with dreadlocks, that ambiguous action would produce fear in many people.”\n\n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
