        "text": "A Connecticut teen-ager who was missing for six days after she took a train to New York City was reunited with her family early yesterday after the police found her at a New Jersey home where she was staying.\n\nMelissa Gay, 14, met her parents, Robert and Lynette, at the police station in Montville, N.J., at 2:30 A.M. yesterday and returned home to Ridgefield, Conn.\n\nWe haven't really talked to her yet,\" Mr. Gay said yesterday from the Pierre Hotel. \"We just gave her hugs and brought her home.\"\n\nMr. Gay, a partner in the private investment firm Bain Capital, launched a huge search with the help of business partners Thursday to help locate his daughter, whom the family had not heard from since last Saturday.\n\nMelissa left her parents' home that day, took a train to New York and never returned after attending a rave concert on Randalls Island. While at the concert, her father said, she took the drug Ecstasy and then \"wandered the city.\" During her wandering, her father said, she met a young man who took her to his parents' home in Towaco, N.J.\n\nThe young man, whose name was not released, kept her in the home without his parents' knowledge, the police said. Officers went to the home in response to several telephone calls, but the police would not give further details. The Montville police said no charges would be filed.",
