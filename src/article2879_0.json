Add your two cents.\nTitans receiver Rishard Matthews was one of many NFL players that felt personally attacked by President Donald Trump’s comments against the NFL and its protesting players, most notably the “son of a bitch” reference, and he now plans to use his platform to advance the protest, Cameron Wolfe of ESPN.com reports.\n“I plan to kneel until the president apologizes for the comments that he made because I felt like those were very disrespectful comments that he made,” Matthews said on ESPN’s NFL Live Tuesday. “The league is made up of I think over 70 percent of African-Americans so the people that would be kneeling for this cause would be African-Americans. To keep it honest, he was calling a lot of us and he was calling me an S.O.B. and that’s not OK and very disrespectful. So, I plan to kneel until the president apologizes.”\nPresident Trump was asked about his issue with the NFL at the White House on Tuesday and said he was “ashamed of what was taking place” with players kneeling during the national anthem.\n“I wasn’t preoccupied with the NFL, I was ashamed of what was taking place,” he said, adding that “the NFL situation is a very important situation.”\n“Many people have died, many people have been horribly injured and they were fighting for our country, our flag, our national anthem, and for people to disrespect that by kneeling during the playing of our national anthem I think is disgraceful,” he said.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
