Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\nJUST WATCHED\nStory highlights\n\"Transparent\" creator Jill Soloway slammed Donald Trump backstage at the Emmys on Sunday night\nSoloway joined a chorus of criticism of the Republican presidential nominee during the awards show\n(CNN)\nOne of the big winners at the Emmys on Sunday night delivered some of the harshest criticism of Donald Trump offstage -- comparing the Republican presidential nominee to Adolf Hitler and warning against what she said were efforts to \"otherize\" groups of people.\nJill Soloway, creator of Amazon's \"Transparent\" and winner in the comedy series directing category, spoke to \"Variety\" backstage during the awards show, where she lit into Trump.\n\"Jews were other-ized in Nazi Germany to gain political power for Hitler, and right now Donald Trump is doing the same thing. He's other-izing people. He calls women pigs if they don't look like beauty pageant contestants. He blames Muslims and Mexicans for our problems. He makes fun of disabled people. This is other-izing with a capital 'O,'\" Soloway said.\nJill Soloway accepts Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series award for 'Transparent' onstage during the 67th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards.\nShe continued, \"It has been used in our history before to start and win wars. He needs to be called out at every chance he gets for being one of the most dangerous monsters to ever approach our lifetimes. He's a complete dangerous monster, and at any moment that I have to call out Trump for being an inheritor to Hitler, I will.\"\nCNN has reached out to Trump campaign for comment and not yet received a response.\nRead More\nWith the criticism, Soloway delivered one of the sharpest Trump condemnations at the awards show -- but she was far from alone, as the program featured a series of actors, directors and producers who slammed the GOP nominee.\n\"Transparent\" lead actor Jeffrey Tambor, another winner who was backstage during the exchange, said he agreed, according to Variety. And he reportedly quoted the poet W.H. Auden, saying \"Love one another or die.\"\nPhotos: 2016 Emmy Awards: Red carpet\nPhotos: 2016 Emmy Awards: Red carpet\nTracee Ellis Ross arrives on the red carpet for the 68th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday, September 18 in Los Angeles.\nHide Caption\nPortia Doubleday\nHide Caption\nMichelle Dockery\nHide Caption\nKristen Bell\nHide Caption\nSarah Paulson\nHide Caption\nGaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin and Millie Bobby Brown\nHide Caption\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus\nHide Caption\nJane Krakowski\nHide Caption\nPadma Lakshmi\nHide Caption\nAnna Chlumsky\nHide Caption\nJerry Seinfeld\nHide Caption\nAmy Landecker\nHide Caption\nHeidi Klum\nHide Caption\nYara Shahidi\nHide Caption\nEmily Ratajkowski\nHide Caption\nConstance Wu\nHide Caption\nAimee Teegarden\nHide Caption\nTrevor Jackson\nHide Caption\nStephanie Allynne\nHide Caption\nHolly Taylor\nHide Caption\nLauren Adams\nHide Caption\nPriyanka Chopra\nHide Caption\nRegina King\nHide Caption\nGwendoline Christie\nHide Caption\nJenifer Lewis\nHide Caption\nTrace Lysette\nHide Caption\nReggie Watts\nHide Caption\nAlexandra Billings\nHide Caption\nAlia Shawkat\nHide Caption\nConstance Zimmer\nHide Caption\nJoanne Froggatt\nHide Caption\nHari Nef\nHide Caption\nLouie Anderson\nHide Caption\nJill Kargman\nHide Caption\nJon Voight\nHide Caption\nFelicity Huffman\nHide Caption\nSarah Hyland\nHide Caption\nAriel Winter\nHide Caption\nSuzanne Cryer\nHide Caption\nEllie Kemper\nHide Caption\nKathryn Hahn\nHide Caption\nJudith Light\nHide Caption\nWilliam H.
