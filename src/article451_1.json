Three separate lawsuits -- two class-action suits filed in California and one filed by New York's attorney general -- argued that the program was mired in fraud and deception. Trump's camp rejected the suits' claims as \"baseless.\" And Trump has charged that the New York case against him is politically motivated.\nHide Caption\nPhotos: Donald Trump's rise\nTrump attends the U.S. Open tennis tournament with his third wife, Melania Knauss-Trump, and their son, Barron, in 2006.

Clinton connected police shootings to \"systemic racism\" while Trump suggested the officer in Oklahoma \"choked.\"\nComments carry weight\nThis is not the first time Trump or Clinton have addressed police shootings during this lengthy campaign season. But as the race nears its conclusion in less than two months, their comments carry even more weight. And the stakes are especially high since one of the shootings occurred in North Carolina, a critical swing state with a sizable African-American population that both campaigns are working hard to reach.\nTrump and Clinton hit the campaign trail following an evening of protests and occasional violence in Charlotte after police killed Keith Lamont Scott in an apartment complex parking lot as officers looked for another man named in a warrant they were trying to serve. That followed the fatal shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week after his car was found abandoned in the middle of the road.\nPhotos: Hillary Clinton's life in the spotlight\nPhotos: Hillary Clinton's life in the spotlight\nHillary Clinton accepts the Democratic Party's nomination for president at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28.

Her defeat marked a stunning end to a campaign that appeared poised to make her the first woman elected US president.\nHide Caption\n43 of 43\n\"There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African-Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,\" Clinton said. \"It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.\"\nShe said she's spoken with law enforcement leaders \"who are as deeply concerned as I am, and as deeply committed as I am to reform.\" And, she said, she's spoken with mothers whose children have been killed, \"and young people who feel that, as far as their country's concerned, their lives seem disposable.\"\n\"We've got to do better. And I know we can. And if I'm elected president, we will. And we will do it exactly together, which is the only way it can be done,\" Clinton said.\nTrump tweeted calls for unity following the violence in Charlotte. His comment during the Fox town hall that the female officer involved in the Tulsa shooting might have \"choked\" was notable considering he typically emphasizes support for law enforcement officers.\nBut Trump said he'd seen the widely circulated video of the incident in Tulsa. \"That man went to the car, hands up -- put his hands on the car,\" Trump said. \"To me it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do. And he looked like a really good man.\"\nChristie vs. Clinton\nMeanwhile, one of Trump's top supporters -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- lambasted Clinton for her response on conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham's show.\nIn a radio interview Tuesday, Clinton had cited the need to address \"systemic racism\" and \"implicit bias\" in police forces -- while praising \"honorable, cool-headed police officers.\"\n\"She's a disgrace. She's a disgrace and those comments are a disgrace,\" Christie said Wednesday on \"The Laura Ingraham Show.\" \"It's typical of Hillary Clinton. She knows nothing but the mouth never stops.\"\nTrump, however, has also displayed a tendency to speak about events before all the facts are made clear. He notably called the explosion in New York City over the weekend a \"bomb\" 30 minutes after the incident, despite a lack of official confirmation.\nAfrican-American outreach\nThe shootings come as Trump and Clinton confront unique challenges with African-American voters.\nClinton's weakness is among millennial voters across the board -- many of whom have told pollsters they are gravitating toward Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein.\nTrump, meanwhile, is attempting to chip into Clinton's commanding lead among African-American voters overall while also appealing to white voters who tend to support the GOP but have been turned off by his rhetoric.\nThat effort hit turbulence Wednesday when Trump campaigned alongside long-time boxing promoter Don King Wednesday in Ohio. King, who is black, used the N-word while introducing Trump, arguing that African-Americans cannot achieve success while emulating whites because they will remain \"negroes.\"\n\"If you're poor, you are a poor negro -- I would use the n-word -- but if you're rich, you are a rich negro. If you are intelligent, intellectual, you are intellectual negro. If you are a dancing and sliding and gliding n***** -- I mean negro -- you are a dancing and sliding and gliding negro,\" King said, laughing along with the crowd after the slip-up. \"You're going to be a negro 'til you die.\"\nTrump also caused controversy Tuesday night when he told a nearly all-white crowd in North Carolina that \"we're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever.\"\nHis remark -- ignoring the nation's deeply flawed history of slavery, Jim Crow laws, segregation and more -- drew a stern rebuke Wednesday from Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and hero of the civil rights movement.\n\"Is he saying that the conditions are worse than slavery? Is he saying that the conditions are worse than the signs that I that saw when I was growing up that said 'white men,' 'colored men,' 'white women,' 'colored women?'\" Lewis said. \"Where is he coming from?\"\n",
