        "text": "Total:\nNewton Laughs at Female Reporter After Asking a Question About WR Routes\nWednesday, October 4, 2017 20:43\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nIt was an uncomfortable scene on Wednesday during the media session with Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, as female reporter Jourdan Rodrigue asked Newton about receivers running routes, and Newton basically laughed her off.\nCam makes it really hard for people to root for him pic.twitter.com/uF0mGdL9Ua\nRodrigue went up to Newton and asked him about the sexist remark one-on-one, and according to the reporter, Newton didn’t give a very good answer, and in her words the answer was no acceptable.\n“I spoke with him after and it was worse. I chose not to share, because I have an actual job to do today and one he will not keep me from.”\nIt’s amazing that Newton would go that route, and even more so that he wouldn’t say ‘sorry’ to Rodrigue after the remark.
