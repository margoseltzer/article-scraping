Add your two cents.\nAfter a bit of sweating on both sides, it appears an agreement to reopen the government has been reached.\nAccording to the Washington Examiner , Senate Democrats are willing to agree to a vote on a bill that will kick in and keep the government open until February 8.\n“I think it’ll be open by what? 12:10? 12:15?” Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said ahead of planned Senate vote to end the shutdown.\n“We’re going to reopen the government,” added Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va.
