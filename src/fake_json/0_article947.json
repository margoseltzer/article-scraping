        "text": "Saturday, January 20, 2018 16:32\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nJanuary 21st, 2018\nBy Josh Richardson\nTime perception is a construction of the brain. How fast we perceive time to be passing — or “mind time” — can be manipulated or distorted, with our evaluations of time differing based on our state of being at the time of judgment.\nCould how you age and how long you live be depend on that perception?\nPeople tend to see  their will  as more determinant of future events than of past events. When we contemplate the future we feel as though we have a choice and are likely to influence future events, but when we consider our own past we often feel like many of the things that have happened were out of our control. When people see that their actions are tied to what actually happens around them, their perception of free will changes, or at the very least, is activated.\nSimilarly, mind time also depends on your projected future state of being. If you’re counting down to a root canal,  time speeds up as you wait . But if you’re tallying days until the birth of your first child, time seems immeasurably slow. If you’re bored or suffering, every second counts, and  time seems to expand or slow down . When you’re ecstatic, moments glitter right through your fingers.\nSince time perception is a construction of the brain, what would happen to our sense of time if we knew we could to live to be 150? Or even 500?\n[PINTEREST]: http://pinterest.com/wakeupword/\n[TWITTER]:  http://twitter.com/joinwakeupworld\n[YOUTUBE]: http://www.youtube.com/joinwakeupworld          \n[WEBSITE]: http://wakeup-world.com \nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
