Add your two cents.\ncaseyresearch.com / December 15 2017\nJustin’s note: Commodities are in the early innings of a massive bull market.\nAt least, that’s what Doug Casey thinks. But here’s the thing… He’s not just talking about gold and silver. He thinks commodities, as a group, are about to take off.\nDoug doesn’t think gold and silver are about to skyrocket. He thinks commodities, as a group, are about to take off.\nDoug has so much conviction in this call that he just launched a new commodity letter, which he talks about below in this brand-new interview.\nRead on to see why the stage is set for a monster rally in commodities…\nJustin: Doug, I hear you’re excited about commodities. Why is that?\nDoug: Well, let me start by saying that commodities have been in a bear market for the last 5,000 years.\nThe real price of commodities, whether we’re talking livestock, grains, energy, or metals, has been falling since the dawn of civilization.\nAnd that trend will continue.\nJustin: How come?\nDoug: Because in primitive times we only had raw sticks and stones and wild animals and plants. If you found a little piece of metallic iron from a meteorite, you were the equivalent of a caveman billionaire. If you could find the corpse of a dead deer, you could fend off starvation for another week. If you found a berry bush it was as big a deal as owning a supermarket today.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
