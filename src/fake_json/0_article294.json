        "text": "By RedState (Reporter)\nTotal:\nIt’s Mueller Time: Special Counsel Is Ready to Hear From President Trump (Is He Ready to Comply?)\nTuesday, January 23, 2018 16:09\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nI’ve said on more than one occasion that Trump would tweet or talk himself into trouble, eventually.\nHe’s not in absolute trouble, yet, but his time before special counsel Robert Mueller may be approaching, as a new report suggests that Mueller is particularly interested in interviewing the president, after talking with Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier Tuesday.\nThe new report is also suggesting that Trump’s legal team may have a list of conditions for Trump’s testimony to Mueller by next week.\nOf those conditions, it seems they want to keep any actual face-to-face time to a minimum, and are going to ask if Trump can turn in written answers, for at least a portion of the interview questions.\nMueller’s main focus is said to be on Trump’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey.\nThat makes sense, considering Trump’s team say the firing was over Comey’s handling of the Clinton email scandal, but Trump quickly corrected them by announcing to the world that it was because of the “Russia thing.”\nAt the very least, Trump’s own words lend credibility to Comey’s testimony that Trump asked him to let his former National Security advisor Michael Flynn off the hook, from his part in the Russia investigation.\nSpeaking of Michael Flynn, his departure is also in Mueller’s crosshairs.\nFlynn is one of several Trump team members who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.\nIn his resignation, Flynn apologized for giving an inaccurate assessment of his conversation with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to Pence, then the vice president-elect.\nJeff Sessions’ decision to recuse himself and Trump’s reaction, including his frenzied, abusive tweets towards his attorney general are on Mueller’s agenda, as well.\nMueller is also reportedly interested in Trump’s pressure on Sessions, one source told the Post. The person told the newspaper that Mueller was investigating whether Trump had established a “pattern” of behavior.\nBy “pattern of behavior” I assume his attempts to berate, harangue, and pressure staff and Cabinet members into a position where they may do something unlawful or unethical.\nSessions very well knows he couldn’t leave himself in control of the Russia probe, considering he could likely be caught up in it, as one of the subjects of investigation.\nPresident Trump has previously said that he felt Mueller would be fair to him and that he’d gladly speak with him. That morphed into it was unlikely that he’d agree to speak with him.\nOther than his raging, frothing tweets against the ongoing Russia probe, there’s no response to the latest, regarding Mueller’s desire to speak with him.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
