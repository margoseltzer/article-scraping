Add your two cents.\nIn what is one of the most terrifying, but not surprising, interviews ever to come out of the political arena. Republican Representative Paul Gosar from the great state of Arizona is now suggesting that the Obama administration had indeed weaponized the executive branch in pursuit of partisan political purposes.\nCongressman Gosar came to this conclusion after reading a classified four-page memo which was composed by Republican Congressman Devin Nunes from California. Nunez, who chairs the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, claimed that in the memo Gosar described serious abuse of executive power as a habit across the Obama administration, the Justice Department, the CIA and the FBI. The memo is yet to be released to the public.\nGosar linked the following Obama-era operations and events as prime examples of a pattern of the highly partisan weaponization of the executive branch by Obama and his lackeys. The Fast and Furious gun-running operation, the handling response and coverup of the September 11, 2012, Islamic terrorist attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi where 4 lives were lost including that of our ambassador to Libya, the IRS’s targeting of dissident charities and non-profits such as the Tea Party, and the surveillance of persons connected to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Donald Trump himself.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
