Add your two cents.\nSchaumburg, IL — In a testament as to how the world is rejecting the war on cannabis and, instead, embracing its incredible medicinal properties, an Illinois court has just  ruled  that an 11-year-old girl will be able to treat her seizures with cannabis — while at school.\nNothing highlights the hypocrisy, immorality, and sheer idiocy of the drug war quite like marijuana prohibition. Here we have a medicine that  kills cancer  cells, saves the lives of  countless epileptic children , heals  broken bones,   relieves pain , treats  PTSD , is not dangerous, and exhibits a variety of other incredible benefits –  yet the state will kill you over it.  The good news is, however, that in spite of the reefer madness maniacs tightening their grip on the drug war, people are resisting and the effects are saving lives — Ashley Surin is one of them.\nWhen she was much younger, Ashley found herself in a battle for her life as leukemia took over. Thankfully, she won that battle but not without consequences. As a result of the chemotherapy, Ashley developed seizures.\nLuckily for Ashley, however, medical marijuana helped to drastically decrease those seizures.\n“We’re amazed with her progress,” Maureen Surin, Ashley’s mother told NPR. There was a catch, however, in treating Ashley’s seizures with cannabis — she couldn’t go to school — because it was illegal.\nAshley’s family wasn’t going down without a fight though and this week, in a landmark ruling, she won that fight.\nAs NPR reports, her parents filed a lawsuit in federal court on Wednesday against Schaumburg School District 54 and the State of Illinois, claiming that the state’s ban on taking the drug at school violates the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). On Friday, a judge ruled in their favor after hearing from the school district, which reportedly  had concerns  that its employees may be subject to legal penalties for helping Ashley with her medications.\nOrder by Phone at 888-809-8385 or online at www.mitocopper.com\nGet our Free Ebook, \"Suppressed Health Secrets\"   with  Natural Cures THEY don't want you to know!\nAPeX - Far superior to colloidal silver!  Destroys Viruses, Bacteria, Pathogens with Oxygen plus Silver!\nSupreme Fulvic - Nature's most important supplement!
