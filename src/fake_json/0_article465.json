        "text": "By City Farmer News (Reporter)\nNational nonprofit aims to put gardens in 100 Detroit schools\nWednesday, January 24, 2018 7:49\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nKimbal Musk, co-founder and CEO, Big Green, stands in a learning garden in Indianapolis.\nSince 2011, it has created learning garden classrooms, with raised beds planted with fruits and vegetables and student seating areas, in Denver, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles and Chicago, serving about 250,000 students.\nBy Sherri Well\nExcerpt:\nThe nonprofit plans to build its first learning garden in April and to have 100 in place within 2 1/2 years, Musk said. “Will be moving very fast.”\nBig Green looks to build on the urban agriculture, community garden and school garden projects sprouting around Detroit.\nSchool gardens have shown to be a powerful tool to improve test scores, Musk said.\n“If you teach the exact same science lesson in fifth grade in the classroom and then move it out to the garden, you’ll get a 15-point increase in test scores for those who had the outdoor lesson. It’s so much more powerful than learning in the classroom.”\nAs for the produce that’s grown, many schools choose to do a farmers market, selling it to parents. Others incorporate it into the cafeteria menu so students can eat the food they’ve grown, he said.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
