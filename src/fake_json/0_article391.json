        "text": "By economic news\nTotal:\nTrump Forces Pentagon to Drain Swamp Corruption, Carry Out Historic $2.4T Review\nMonday, January 22, 2018 10:43\n \nAmericans are always concerned when they hear the word ‘billion’ in relation to government spending. And they should be, considering that all that money comes from their hard-earned tax dollars.\nSo, when the Pentagon announced that it was going to do something that has never been done before, and it would take $1 billion to do it, of course Americans are going to show real concern.\nEspecially when it’s something that has been required of the Department of Defense by federal law since the 1990s, but has never been completed.\nLeave it to President Trump to finally get the Pentagon to fall in line. The DoD has agreed to go through a full financial audit for the first time ever.\nAnd just to be clear, the DoD has been around since 1949, but came as an outgrowth of the National Security Act of 1947. So, that’s 70 years of no financial accountability folks.\n“The most shocking thing about being in Congress that there has never been a comprehensive audit of the DoD,” said Rep. Salud Carbajal, D-Calif., who is a freshman member of the committee.“I think if we don’t get it together, we are going to lose the American people’s trust in what we are trying to do here.”\nHouse lawmakers on Wednesday applauded the Pentagon’s effort to finally undergo a full audit, even though Defense Department Comptroller David Norquist said the effort could lead to almost $1 billion in costs this year.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
