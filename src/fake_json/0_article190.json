Add your two cents.\nGuns.com got a chance to catch up with Brett Favre during the 2018 SHOT Show. The Hall of Fame quarterback was introduced to hunting when he was traded to the Green Bay Packers in February of 1992. He quickly got bit by the hunting bug and dove in head first. One of the reasons Brett says he likes hunting in Wisconsin so much is because it allows him to get away from the hustle and bustle of life and get back to nature, we can relate. We discussed his favorite caliber to shoot, his favorite animal to shoot, and his bucket list hunt that he wants to go on someday.\nBrett is also partnering with Orca Coolers to promote the brand. They are raffling off limited edition Brett Favre signed Packers coolers and offer all the NFL, MLB, and NHL teams printed on the coolers. We compared the Orca Cooler to other major brands and these coolers could keep up with the best of them. Offering an American made product at a substantially less price, Orca Coolers is a brand worth considering.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
