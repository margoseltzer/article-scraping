        "text": "By Jeffery Pritchett\nTotal:\nThe Day I Died: The Dark Night of The Soul Experience (Video)\nWednesday, January 24, 2018 15:56\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\n“Please God, take me. End this suffering. I am done. No more of this. No more of anything. I am done.”\nLike it was yesterday, I remember the first day I wanted to die, and meant it.\nThe despair, the feeling of being so utterly lost and frustrated that the only way out was to let this moment be the ending. The definite end of my life. It was the first of many days like this, a string of minutes, hours and days where my whole being cried for relief.\nI was too sick to miss much of my regular life. I was disconnected from the world. I didn’t miss any of it, it seemed too distant. The family barely came to see me, and when they did, they would sit downstairs in the living room. Friends stopped inviting us to events, and none of them came knocking at our door.\nFrom living a life filled with traveling, running my own business, being the center of the party, being the happy, energetic mother, sister, daughter, friend and wife, I became nothing. From being an athletic high heal bad ass do-it-all for everybody, I became nothing. Not for them, not for me. That was my truth. The Rheumatoid Arthritis,  Lyme , ulcers and anxiety had me choking on my own life.\nIt was like the outside disappeared. Everything became silent. My phone stopped ringing, and I resided in a bubble of pain and  loneliness . Reading on the Internet, praying, crying and raging. I became my emotions, the anger. I felt hopeless and helpless. I questioned everything. I no longer believed in the medical doctors and their training. I no longer had any hope of recovery. According to the ones that I had put my faith in, there was nothing that could be done to regain my health. Only a life where medication and pain, deformities and disabilities would reign. I was on my own.\n \nI host the Church of Mabus radio show and it is going on 8 years. I’ve been in the paranormal community for 20 years.
