        "text": "Sword vs Knife Fight Video\nMonday, January 22, 2018 14:25\n \nHere’s something you don’t see every day: Two guys fighting, one armed with a knife, the other one with a sword.\nWARNING: Very Graphic content\nCommon sense would dictate that the man with the much larger blade, fighting out in the open with room to move around, would have a clear advantage. We don’t see the complete incident but we see the knife wielder cleverly closing the distance to negate the reach advantage of the sword and use his knife. We also hear what appears to be a parry so the knife wielder is probably skilled in its use too.\nBut the video also shows how important mindset is. We talk about mindset often and we understand its importance, but here you see it live. The swordsman was unsure about using his weapon after they get up. The man armed with the knife didn’t have such reservations and was far more committed to the fight.\nSomething else that comes to mind, the importance of an hemostatic agent such as Celox in an EDC bag . A knife wound, gun shot wound, terror attack or accident on the street, any of these can leave you bleeding to death and the tool to stop that from happening can save your life.\nTake care folks.\nFerFAL\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
