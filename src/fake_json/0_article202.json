        "text": "By Jeffery Pritchett\nTotal:\nUS Navy Plane Swoops Down on Russian Ship 'Spotted 27 Miles Off US Coast' (Video)\nThursday, January 25, 2018 5:45\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nThe P-8A Poseidon was launched from Naval Air Station Jacksonville to track the Russian ship, the Viktor Leonov, just 24 nautical miles (27 miles) off the coast of Nolfolk, in southeastern Virginia, according to military flight trackers.\nFlight monitoring data shows the P-8A, a state-of-the-art anti-submarine plane, circling at an altitude of 3,350ft just off the coast of Virginia Beach. \nThe Boeing US Navy plane flew out towards the Atlantic Ocean before turning back in the direction of Virginia Beach and flying over the same position, flight monitors show.\nThe US military is yet to release a statement about the flight but has confirmed the Russian ship is being tracked by the destroyer USS Cole and other naval vessels. \nSteffan Watkins, an nautical intelligence analyst, claims the Viktor Leonov was “sitting just outside US territorial waters” near Nolfolk, where the P-8A has been spotted.  \nHe wrote on Twitter: “I have a medium to high degree of confidence that the Russian Navy AGI Viktor Leonov is currently sitting outside Norfolk, just outside US territorial waters, ~24NM+ from Virginia Beach. Don’t forget to wave!”\nThe Viktor Leonov, a high-tech spy ship designed to intercept communications signals, was spotted operating in the Caribbean last week, according to a US defence official. \nIt is not clear where the vessel, thought to be a Vishnya class intelligence collection ship, is headed. \nIn the past, the spy ship has traveled up the eastern seaboard near Cape Canaveral, King’s Bay, Norfolk and New London, CNN reported.\nUS naval bases are situated in all of these locations. \nThe ship is believed to be on a four-to-six month intelligence mission off the east coast of the US, officals told CNN. \nLast March, the Viktor Leonov was spotted 20 miles south of the US Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, near the Florida border. \nThe latest mission comes at a time of heightened military tensions between the US and Russia. \n \n \nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
