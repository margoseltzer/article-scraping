        "text": "By Climate Change Dispatch (Reporter)\nTotal:\nNew U.S. Navy Warship Frozen in Ice in Montreal Until Spring Thaw\nMonday, January 22, 2018 13:35\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nThe US Navy’s newest littoral combat ship, the USS Little Rock, is stuck in ice caused by global warming.\nThe USS Little Lock (LCS-9), a brand new U.S. Navy warship that has been stuck in Montreal for weeks due to icy weather, will spend the rest of the winter in Canada.\nThe littoral combat ship, which was commissioned in Buffalo, New York on Dec. 16, was beginning its maiden journey to its home port in Jacksonville, Florida, when on Christmas Eve, it could not move through the ice in the St. Lawrence Seaway.\nThe St. Lawrence Seaway connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean and flows through Montreal.\nThe Little Rock is now in a port in Montreal, waiting for the weather to improve before she may continue her journey to the Sunshine State, the Canadian Press reported Sunday.\nNavy spokesperson Lt.-Cmdr. Courtney Hillson explained the Little Rock’s situation in Montreal to the Canadian Press.\nThe USS Little Rock (pictured, stuck in ice in Montreal).\n“The temperatures in Montreal and throughout the transit area have been colder than normal, and included near-record low temperatures, which created significant and historical conditions in the late December, early January time frame,” Hillson said.\n“Keeping the ship in Montreal until waterways are clear ensures the safety of the ship and crew, and will have limited impact on the ship’s operational schedule.”\nThe USS Little Rock got trapped in ice in the St Lawrence Seaway (pictured) in Montreal.\nThe $440 million warship, whose new homeport will be at Naval Station Mayport, was commissioned next to the first USS Little Rock, a World War II cruiser which is currently a museum ship.\nThe ceremony marked the first time a U.S. Navy warship was commissioned next to a ship of the same name.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
