Add your two cents.\nLuke gives us further proof that when the King arrives on the earth at the Second Coming, He is already married, and that could only have taken place in Heaven beforehand\n“After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.” Revelation 4:1 (KJV)\nWhen you learn how to rightly divide the Bible as Paul commands us to do, one thing among many becomes crystal-clear really fast. That the Rapture of the Church must take place before the start of the time of Jacob’s trouble. All you non-dividers are right now copying and pasting “..after the tribulation of those days” to blast out the comments section, but it is to no avail. The Bible will not allow any other scenario for the Church in the end times but a pretribulation rapture.\nAs usual, I have broken it out into bullet points to make it easier to understand.\nTHE POST TRIBULATION RAPTURE IN MATTHEW 24: Let’s start with the elephant in the room first. “Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:” Matthew 24:29 (KJV). Non-dividers read this verse and immediatly think they have “solved” the problem, but they have not. Yes, they have found a rapture, but not the Rapture of the Church. There are multiple raptures in the Bible, starting with Enoch, Elijah, then Jesus in Acts 1, the Church, the 144,000, the Two Witnesses. See what I mean? The rapture in Matthew 24 is not the rapture of the Church that Paul calls the Blessed Hope. For starters, these tribulation saints are gathered by angels, but the Church is taken up to be with Jesus directly. Secondly, the saints in Matthew 24 hear a trumpet, but the Church hears a voice like a trumpet. Lastly, when you read the verses in Matthew 24:29 that immediately precede it, verses 26-28, what part of Revelation does that match up with? Why, Revelation 19, of course. Where does that put you? At the Second Coming. The non-dividers fail to see this because, well, they are non-dividers.\nTHE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE CHURCH AFTER REVELATION 3: Read the first chapter of Revelation sometime, and pay careful attention to the number 7. It shows up exactly 12 times, and every mention is a reference to the church. In chapters 2 and 3, a message is given to each one of these 7 churches and every one ends with “He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches;…” ever wonder about that? Revelation 3:22 is the last time the word “churches” is mentioned. Flash-forward to Revelation 13 and you see this rather interesting warning. “If any man have an ear, let him hear.” Revelation 13:9 (KJV). Hmm, that sounds just like the 7 warnings in chapters 2 and 3 except it’s not directed at the church. Where did the church go? Glad you asked, right here. Back to Revelation 4, and we read this: “After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.” Revelation 4:1 (KJV). The “after this” that John is referring to is “after the Church Age” ends. Verse 4 John sees the end of the Church Age, the “open door” that is Jesus Christ, and he walks through that door in the rapture. Where else have we seen language like this? Right here. “But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.” John 10:2-4,9 (KJV). Now isn’t that an amazing thing? How many times have you read John 10 and never seen the Pre Tribulation Rapture in there? Now you have. The whole chapter is compare and contrast of Jesus Christ with Antichrist. The good shepherd versus the idol shepard of Zechariah 11:17. The Pretribulation Rapture is also found in John 14. Revelation 4:1 starts with “after this” and ends with “which must be hereafter”. Clearly the time of Jacob’s trouble is after the end of the Church Age.\n THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB IMMEDIATELY PRECEDES THE SECOND COMING: Starting in Revelation 19:11, we see the gathering together of the Lord’s Army mounting up on white horses and getting ready to return with Him at the Second Coming. Who are the soldiers in this army? “Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.” 2 Timothy 2:3,4 (KJV). The born again redeemed Church is made up of soldiers, at the Second Coming we will be literal soldiers riding into battle. But starting in verse 7 of Revelation 19, we see that the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife is ready and waiting for the ceremony to commence. As we have seen in previous studies, it is the Church that is the Bride of Christ .  Not only that, we are wearing fine, white linen because we have been born again. You will notice that we are in Heaven, and ready to get married. We are not on the earth, running from Antichrist! So the marriage takes place in Heaven just prior to the Second Coming, and the honeymoon takes place on earth. Remember t hose virgins in Matthew 25 , the ones who are invited to a reception? That’s who is waiting for the King to return with His Bride, the Church. Finally, Luke gives us further proof that when the King arrives on the earth, He is already married, and that could only have taken place in Heaven. “And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.” Luke 12:36 (KJV).\nI have only given you 3 bullet points today, but if you will take the time and run all the references and study them in context, you will find them to be quite meaty indeed. Every wonder why your bible studies may have not brought you to the same conclusion as mine have? Perhaps that’s because you are not dividing, and if you are, it might not be rightly as Paul commands. Things that are different are not the same. A voice ‘as it were of a trumpet’ is not the same as a trumpet being blown by an angel. In fact, it’s the opposite. Rightly dividing makes that clear.\nI hope this study is a blessing to you!

Any other way doesnt make sense.\nBut here is the thing. It wont be much longer when scoffers and those who arent watching and expecting to be raptured will be here to dwell on how wrong you was.\nJan 20, 2018, 6:02 pm\nTruthseeker\nPsp\nThere is no rapture and I have been watching closely for 50 years.\nWhy do you suppose Jesus Christ in  Revelation 20 states there will be A “First” Resurrection and then states the rest of the dead do not live again until after the 1000 years of the reign of Jesus Christ? which indicates a 2nd resurrection will follows the First.\n4  And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands;—— and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.\n5  But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.\n6  Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, ——and shall reign with him a thousand years.\nThose in the first resurrection reign with HIM for 1000 years.\nDo you read in verse 4 of the Thrones those that will rule with Christ for 1000 (verse 6) years will sit on?\nWhy do you suppose Jesus is called the KING of kings — could it be the resurrected Saints of God will rule on earth for 1000 years with Christ on HIS Throne as kings and lords and priest?\nRev. 5: 10 “And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.”\nI completely and totally pass on a rapture as I am looking forward to ruling here on earth with my Master Jesus Christ as a king.\nAnd just what is it you expect to DO in the 3rd heaven as all of the great work will be here on earth?\nOH I get it you will just roll around heaven all day. I hope you get your kicks from rolling. i do not i love to work and to accomplish.\nJan 20, 2018, 6:56 pm\nJan 20, 2018, 11:03 am\nTruthseeker\nthe one he twisted to make it seem as though there is a separate rapture — as he does all the others.\n1  And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the “mount Sion”, and with him an hundred forty [and] four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads.\nThey will stand with Christ on the Mount of Olives i.e. Sion, here on earth not in heaven — what is the Father’s Name – God! and will those “Christians that lied about being followers of Christ, worship before their feet?\n9  Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. Can any other then God be worshiped?\nSee Zechariah 14: 4 His feet shall stand the Day on the Mount of Olives.\nAnd what is the synagogue of Satan – the so called christians that refuse to DO the WORD of God— you know that WORD Christ commanded we live by it’s every word\n4  These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.

But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.\n8  And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.\nJesus Christ could not marry as He was still married to the House of Judah.\nJan 21, 2018, 4:30 pm\nThese celibate Israelite males were consecrated to the Lord!  Even Yochanan took the Nazirite (=consecrated/separated) vow:\nRegarding your ludicrous argument, worm, how could Yehoshu’a be married to the House of Judah but will marry New Jerusalem?\nYou said that Christ cannot marry New Jerusalem as Revelation 21:9-14 states, but He can marry the House of Judah?  Really now… lol\nJan 22, 2018, 12:19 pm\nLOL at this Xtian nonsense!\nFake rapture, fake greek text copied from old gnostic dogma and rebranded, fake gods with fake prophecies. There are going to be alot of people wondering where their supposed god is when they call out for it and it never appears!\nJan 20, 2018, 12:54 pm\nYou’re absolutely correct!  This one, false teaching will be the MAJOR cause of the Great Apostasy!\nJan 21, 2018, 11:01 am\nAlso, they will follow after the “gods” working signs and wonders and will reject the two witnesses of Enoch and Elijah.  In fact, they will celebrate and exchange gifts when Leviathan, the seven-headed sea monster created on the fifth “yom” and current resides in a deep abyss, kills them in Jerusalem!  JUST AS THE SCRIPTURES STATE!  At least some Jews know the connection between Leviathan and the Marriage Supper. lol\nI’ll keep reiterating this until it sinks into Christians’ thick skulls… One of the larger lies of most Christian churches — a pre-Tribulation rapture:\nMatthew 24:29 “But immediately AFTER THE TRIBULATION [emphasis mine] of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky [lit. heaven], and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30 And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory. 31 And He will send forth His angels with a great trumpet and they will gather together His elect [lit. chosen ones] from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other. (NASB)\nMark 13:24 “But in those days, AFTER THE TRIBULATION [emphasis mine], the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light, 25 and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken. 26 Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. 27 And then He will send forth the angels, and will gather together His elect [lit. chosen ones] from the four winds, from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest end of heaven. (NASB)\nThis represents two witnesses in the synoptic Gospels.  So, if ANYONE teaches a pre-tribulation rapture, they are a false teacher; it’s as simple as that.  Matthew 10:22, 24:13 and Mark 13:13 all state that those who endure to the end (i.e., remain a believer in Christ until death or are still living at His return) will be saved.\nJan 21, 2018, 10:54 am\nHow The Leaven Of The END TIMES PROPHECY DECEPTIONS  Spread\nThis Revelation Timeline Decoded study page will explain how THE CONCEPTS  of a one-man end-times ANTICHRIST  in a 7-YEAR TRIBULATION PERIOD BECAME  so PREVALENT, AFTER  1800 YEARS  of Biblical teaching THAT KNEW NOTHING of the SORT.\nYou will learn how the\nJESUITS  of the Roman Catholic Church\nMANIPULATED THE BIBLE PROPHECY  TO CREATE an END-TIMES ANTICHRIST, INORDER TO DELECT BLAME AWAY FROM THEM\nAS THE ANTICHRIST system.\nThe Beasts of Daniel and Revelation study reveals that the\nROMAN CATHOLIC  CHURCH  IS THE ‘BEA$T of REVELATION’,\nthe ‘LITTLE HORN of DANIEL’, and\nTHE POPE THE ‘$ON of PERDITION’.\nTHAT’$ NOT TO SAY THERE WON’T BE AN END-TIME$\nFAL$E ME$$IAH…BUT….THE TRUTH…IS THAT $ATAN’$….\nANTICHRIST BEA$T….\n*\nThe Roman Catholic Church empowered the JE$UIT$ to COUNTER the REFORMATION.\nIn 1545, they started meeting at what’s called the Council of Trent.\nOne of its main purposes was to plan A COUNTER ATTACK Martin LUTHER AND  the  PROTESTANTS.\nTo do this they empowered THE JE$UIT$ who were a secret Catholic order founded by Ignatius Loyola. They call themselves the Society of Jesus, but you’ll soon find out that they ARE THE $OCIETY of $ATAN.\nTHEIR WORK  was to be done not only through the Inquisition and THROUGH TORTURE, but also through theology AND\nDECEPTION.\nThe Catholic Church gave the Jesuits the specific assignment of bringing Protestantism back to the “Mother Church.” Look at the state of today’s liberal Lutheran church, and you know they’ve been successful.\nCentral to this plan, was the need to deflect accusations that THEY WERE THE ANTICHRI$T BEA$T SYSTEM.\nThe JE$UIT$ ARE A COVERT MILITARY ORDER of the Roman Catholic Church, not just priests.\nTHEY USE FIFTH COLUMN TACTIC$  to infiltrate every institution they seek TO DESTROY.\nInstead of attacking from the outside, where everyone can see them, THEY COVERTLY ATTACK FROM THE INSIDE.\nThe JESUITS  infiltrate the very thing they wish to destroy. They’ve PRETENDED TO BE CHRISTIANS and have infiltrated\nChristian institutions, to implement their deceptions inside the walls of Christianity.\nThey countered accusations by CREATING the CONCEPT of an  END-TIMES  one man ANTICHRIST.\nThe Roman Catholic Church had\nJE$UIT PRIEST  FRANCISCO RIBERA,  a brilliant man with a doctorate in theology, write a 500 page commentary with an opposing view, where he MANIPULATED PROPHECIES IN THE BOOKS OF  DANIEL\nAND REVELATION,\nTO CREATE AN END-TIME  7-YEAR TRIBULATION ANTICHRI$T.\nRibera applied all of Revelation to the end time rather than to the history of the church.\nHis explanation was that the prophecies apply only to a single sinister man who will arise up at the end of time; instead of A\nBEA$T, WHICH THE BIBLE SAYS IS A POWERFUL KINGDOM  (THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH).\nHe said that the Antichrist would be an infidel from outside the church of God; instead of someone who presents himself as Christ (THE POPE,  who CALLS HIMSELF  THE VICAR of CHRIST).\nHe said that the Antichrist would make a 7-year peace agreement with the Jews.\nThe most important PASSAGE that THEY MANIPULATED is the 70 Weeks of Daniel prophecy in Daniel 9:24-27.\nTHEY APPLIED the  70th WEEK of DANIEL\nTO AN END-TIMES ANTICHRIST,\nREPLACING  the 7-YEAR PERIOD of Jesus  NEW COVENANT BEING OFFERED TO  the HOUSE of ISRAEL from  27-34 A.D.\nTHESE MAY BE THE FOUR MOST IMPORTANT PROPHECY VERSE in all  of the Bible, BECAUSE OF THE END-TIMES DECEPTIONS\nTHAT ARE BASED ON THEM.\nTo read a Bible study that proves that the covenant of the 70th week of Daniel was from Jesus Christ, not an end time Antichrist, click on 70 Weeks Of Daniel Covenant Deception\nThis idea, called Futurism, deferred accusations away from the Roman Catholic Church and the Papacy, so Rome quickly adopted this viewpoint as the Church’s official position on the Antichrist.\nProphecies in Daniel and Revelation tell us about the battle between Jesus and Satan throughout history, from the time they were written to Jesus second coming.\nThe ‘beast of Revelation‘, the ‘Little Horn of Daniel‘, the ‘son of Perdition’ and the ‘Babylonian Harlot,’ all apply to the history of the Antichrist Roman Catholic Church, who proclaims to be Christian, but has opposed true Christianity throughout their history. This is called Historicism.\nSATAN HAS USED JESUIT  controlled FALSE PROPHETS and misled Christians TO PROMOTE THE LIE of Futurism.\nFollowing close behind Francisco Ribera was another brilliant Jesuit scholar, Cardinal Robert Bellarmine of Rome.\nCardinal Bellarmine promoted Ribera’s concepts in his work “Polemic Lectures Concerning the Disputed points of the Christian Belief Against the Heretics of this Time“.\nHis writings claimed that Paul, Daniel, and John had nothing whatsoever to say about the Papal power. He taught that Antichrist was a single individual who would not rule until the very end of time.\nHis teachings won general acceptance among Catholics.\nFor almost 300 years after the Council of Trent, Jesuit futurism remained largely within Catholicism.\nThe Futurism of Ribera never posed a positive threat to Protestants worldwide for three centuries, and was virtually confined to the Roman Church.\nRibera’s MANIPULATION of BIBLICAL TEXT WAS REJECTED   for hundreds of years, by discerning students of the Bible, who knew better.\nBut the Jesuits persisted with their plan to cause the Protestants to adopt this doctrine.\nThe King James Bible removed the witness of the Geneva Bible scholars about Jesus fulfilling the 70th week of Daniel.\nARE YOU PREPARED TO SPIRITUALLY WITHSTAND A FAKE RAPTURE?\nThe Rapture of the Church: Christianity’s Most Preposterous Belief VHS or Audio Tape\nBehold A Pale Horse\nSubtitle: The ILLUMINAT NOW CLAIMS TO HAVE THE TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO STAGE THE RAPTURE.\nThey might just carry it out IN ORDER TO THROW EXTREME PANIC, CONFUSSION and DESPAIR  into the hearts of genuine Christians just before their beloved MASONIC christ  arises. God just may allow it as a final test of His saints.

Key words in study Bibles: “not found in early mss” (=manuscripts). Esther makes NO MENTION of God and was not found among the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS). 1 Enoch and Jubilees were the third and sixth most frequent manuscripts discovered among the DSS; see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls#Biblical_books_found . Jude quotes 1 Enoch. Jasher was also excluded yet mentioned in the OT among others.\n* Heaven is NOT the domain of humans — only the Elohim! True believers will tabernacle with Christ in New Jerusalem on the New Earth.\n* Lucifer is a manufactured name by the RCC; his name is Belial.\n* There will be a “gathering of the elect” (=chosen ones) AFTER the Tribulation.\n* “Jesus” is the transliteration from the Latin — NOT the translation! His Name is Yehoshu’a, ‘Iesous, or Joshua, and He was certainly conceived of the Holy Spirit on the Feast of New Oil in 5 CE and born on the Feast of Weeks in 6 CE during the census of Quirinius ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_of_Quirinius ) when Herod Archelaus ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_Archelaus ) was “King of the Jews” (ruler of Judea). Herod the Great died a decade before. The Herods were Edomites (descendants of Esau).\n* Yahoah (true pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton) was the firstborn of Creation; everything was created through and for Him, and through Him ALL things hold together!
