        "text": "By Now The End Begins\nTotal:\nJesus In John 3 Commands Us To Become Born Again Because Our First Birth In Adam Is No Good\nSunday, January 21, 2018 10:04\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nJesus commands us to become born again because our first birth created us in the likeness of sinful man, and not in the image of a holy God.\n“Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.” John 3:7 (KJV)\nHow many times I have overheard people talking, especially here in the South, and invariably the expressions “we are all children of God” and “we are all made in God’s image” will come up. That sounds nice and comforting, but is it true? If you and I were born in the image of God, then why do we need to become born again? The answer is a very simple one.\nWhen Jesus was teaching Nicodemus some Bible in John 3, he threw this ‘master of Israel’ quite the doctrinal curveball. It so flustered Nicodemus that he just kinda sputters along helplessly, never quite grasping what Jesus is telling him.\n“There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?” John 3:1-10 (KJV)\nNot only does Jesus drop a bomb on Nicodemus, He then asks him how it is possible that Nicodemus is unaware of this simple truth. Evidentially, ol’ Nic is not comparing scripture with scripture. Because if he had, he would have made this connection.\n“And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth: And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:” Genesis 5:3,4 (KJV)\nAnd there it is, the reason why we must become born again if we wish to enter into the kingdom of God. After Adam and Eve sinned, fell and got kicked out of the Garden of Eden, they started having babies. Babies that down the line eventually became you and I, and guess whose image all those billions of babies were made in? Not God’s image. Adam’s image.\nJesus commands us to become born again because our first birth created us in the likeness of sinful man, and not in the image of a holy God.\n“And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.” 1 Corinthians 15:45-50 (KJV)\nAdam was made perfect and was given the title deed to the earth, to rule it as God. He was told to subdue it, multiply his seed, and have dominion over all of it. But shortly into his reign, the Devil showed up and did an end-run around Adam, picked off Eve, and caused Adam to lose his right to rule the earth. It was the very first dispensation, and it ended as all dispensations do, in disaster.\n“…for without me ye can do nothing.” John 15:5 (KJV)\nFlash forward to the New Testament, and we see our apostle Paul talking about how to become a child of God.\n“For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.” Galatians 3:26-29 (KJV)\nThat’s how you become a child of God, that’s how you get God’s image, when you become born again Jesus Christ who is the very image of God.\n“In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.” 2 Corinthians 4:4 (KJV)\nNow you know why Jesus commands us to become born again, because our first birth from father Adam is corrupt. It is also the reason why those who died in the Old Testament, with the exception of the people who were raptured like Enoch and Elijah, went to Abraham’s Bosom instead of Heaven. They were not born again. They were kept safe, but not saved.\nBeing born again is not some 30-second prayer you say becomes someone tells you to say it. Being born again is acknowledging that you are sick and dying with an incurable disease , and asking God to perform the operation that only He can perform. You have become born again in the most literal sense. You have a brand new spirit that can never, ever again be touched with sin and death.\nAt the Rapture, God will then give your reborn soul a reborn body to go with it, and that’s how you will exist with Him for all eternity.\nBody, soul and spirit.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!

Almost universally, Christians will vehemently state the souls of deceased believers immediately go to Heaven, but that is NOT what the Scriptures state.  So, if not Heaven, then where (if anywhere)?\nMost Christians believe they belong to “New Testament churches;” therefore, they have no use for the Old Testament.  But, what did Christ say on this subject?  Examine Matthew 5:17-19: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A17-19&version=NASB . Is Christ a liar?  Have all things been fulfilled?  If you think so, then why is there a need for His Second Coming?\nIn fact, this ALL revolves around His Second Coming and the appointed times (Heb. mo’edim) in the Fall — known by the Jewry as the Days of Awe.  So, where do ALL souls go after death — both the righteous and the wicked?  The Bible calls this specific place by three names:\n* Sheol (65x in the OT) – http://biblehub.com/hebrew/7585.htm ;\n* Hades (10x in the NT; 4x in Revelation) – http://biblehub.com/greek/86.htm ; and\n* Paradise (3x in the NT; this portion of Sheol/Hades is for believers only) – http://biblehub.com/greek/3857.htm .\nTo be perfectly clear, none of these is Hell (which is a misnomer; see http://biblehub.com/greek/1067.htm ) nor the false precept of Purgatory; see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purgatory .\nThis is what the Bible states, and this is but a sampling of each:\nThe passage in Acts 2 is important as even Christ’s soul descended into the netherworld of Sheol/Hades/Paradise.  Recall that He was dead and buried for THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS (15-17 Abib) in accordance with the Jonah prophesy; see https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+12%3A38-41&version=NASB .\nExamine the Greek word translated as “Paradise” again: http://biblehub.com/greek/3857.htm .  It is a park, a garden, an enclosure!  The souls of both the righteous and the wicked DESCEND to the netherworld — using whatever name desired:  Sheol, Hades, or Paradise.\nThose who are TRUE believers in Christ ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16-21&version=NASB ) will be given Grace, which is a judicial pardon on Judgment Day at His Second Coming!  His First Coming was as the Suffering Servant of Isaiah 53 who brought salvation to the world.  His Second is as the conquering priestly king of the order of Melchizedek (Heb. Malki-tsedeq; =my king is righteous[ness]) vanquishing all evil and establishing His Kingdom — where believers will ultimately reside — on the New Earth.\nThose who do not believe in Him will be judged by the Law of Moses, found guilty, and will be thrown into the lake of fire known as Gehenna; examine http://biblehub.com/greek/1067.htm again.\nOnly three people, who were born incarnate on Earth, are currently in Heaven:  1) Christ, who was resurrected, transfigured, and ascended to the right hand of the Father; 2) Enoch; and 3) Elijah.  The latter two are the witnesses (or the metaphorical lampstands [representing the Light of the Word] and olive trees [representing the anointing of the Word]) of Revelation.  As ALL humans MUST die (i.e., the first death), the two witnesses will as well in Jerusalem; see https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+11%3A3-13&version=NASB .\nNote:  Jerusalem is mystically called Sodom and Egypt in this passage; it is also called Mystery Babylon as rabbinic Jews follow the Babylonian calendar in which the fourth (or tenth!) month is named after the Babylonian deity Tammuz, put more faith in the Talmud Bavli (Babylonian Talmud) than they do in the TaNaKh (OT), and recite Adonai for the Tetragrammaton which invokes the Greek Adonis and Babylonian Tammuz.  That’s why it’s necessary for an undefiled New Jerusalem to descend from the New Heaven to the New Earth.  Also, the two witnesses are taken back up into Heaven after they are resurrected.  Their bodies/temples were specially prepared (or at least Enoch’s was documented as being so); in the Book of Enoch, what appeared to be a hot coal was pressed to his lips to purify him.  Focus on v5 if anyone desires to harm them before their time of prophesying is completed; see https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+11%3A5&version=NASB .  These are no longer regular human beings as we know them.\nAfter the wicked are thrown into Gehenna in perpetuity, the Marriage Supper of the Lamb between Christ and the New Jerusalem will commence on Sukkot (=Feast of Tabernacles); see https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A9-14&version=NASB .\nTo recap, this is the order of the resurrection that will occur just before Judgment Day: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A20-58&version=NASB .\nSo, there you have it, folks… The souls of the deceased — even the righteous/elect — are certainly NOT in Heaven.  Not Adam, who was a literal son of God (see Luke 3:38); not Abraham; not Moses; not David; not Mary — NO ONE save Christ at this time.\nShema Yisrael!\nJan 22, 2018, 6:01 am\nMan\nwhat a great, forgiving god the Christian god is, when he first created the rules of sin and then used hereditary sin to blame you of things that Adam did.\nJan 22, 2018, 12:09 am\nNo! God did not create “the rules of sin”.\nIt is the pride of Lucifer, through his rebellion which made “the rules of sin”.\nAbout the “the rules of sin”, if I may expose some parts of the misunderstood Catholic faith.\nThe rebellion of the fallen angels became the cause of a great fear to the holy angels, because angels being pure spirits who know no bound, felt being at the mercy of also falling into rebellion. The first man and first woman, Adam & Eve, being pure spirits contained within the limits of a body, were a hope to the holy angels, because Adam & Eve, in the Garden of Eden, had apparently no reason to rebel, but alas, they did.\nJesus Christ and the Virgin Mother, through their lives and sacrifices, in a perfect imitation from a few faithful, have put and end to the rebellion against God, as well as the redemption.\nJesus Christ, being God, in spite of His human frailties was invincible to Lucifer, because He overcame all His human sufferings. It was to no surprise to the angels since Jesus Christ was of a divine nature. The real hope of the holy angels remained into the Virgin Mary. Was Mary Immaculate able to overcome “the rules of sin”? She did.\nMary Most Holy, the “woman” defeated Lucifer or Satan. To the holy angels, The Virgin Mary brought peace in heaven to all the holy angels, because through her humility and obedience to God, she put an end to the rebellion started by Lucifer, a long time ago.\nJan 22, 2018, 2:51 am\nMan\nGod created the universe.. Lucifer was part of the universe that he created. He is also all knowing. so He knew before he created the universe that sin would be. And he still chose to create that universe and he is too lazy to remove sin and lucifer.\nBut it must be great penalty system to have where one family member did a crime and the grandson still has to pay for those crimes. That is amoral in most, if not all countries with some kind of law in place\nJan 22, 2018, 2:56 am\nKeep mocking the Most High… He bestowed us with freewill choice.  The only one who is lazy is you for not studying the Scriptures, but you’ll have a LONG time to contemplate this when being tormented in Gehenna.\nJan 22, 2018, 6:05 am\nwheeties\nanother son of satan post by laschuetz–your the devils agent trying to put judgement on others you jackass–go back to hell from whence you came devil man\nJan 22, 2018, 12:55 pm\nJan 22, 2018, 3:35 pm\nDaughter of the Church\nYour brain has been completely scrubbed clean and Rome has welded into your brain every lie ii has ever invented in. so sad.\nBut soon Jesus Christ will return and wipe Rome off the face of the earth for ever.\nDid you ever wondered why Christ told us the position of authority David will have in His Government and the 12 Apostles as well but no popes are EVER mentioned?\nthey will all be cast into the Lake of fire. No child molester will ever be in the Kingdom.\nJan 22, 2018, 6:49 am\nsezsue\nNO, NO, NO. FALSE, FALSE, FALSE. Mary was blessed because she was chosen by the Father to become the mother of our Savior. Other than that, she was a normal human woman, born under the same conditions as all of us. After giving birth to our Savior, the first born son, who was always dedicated to God, she “knew” her husband and had other sons and daughters. She was NOT born without sin, and she died. Her body was buried, and the breath of God which makes us become “living souls”, went back to God from whence it came. Mary was not a perpetual virgin, she was not assumpted into heaven without dying. She is not “co-redemptress”, she did not defeat Satan. Her body is in the grave, awaiting the day of judgement, like everyone else who has died. Our Savior is the only one who has entered into heaven, which he came from, the first and only so far. As a former catholic, I recommend reading the actual scripture, and pray that our Father will show you the truth.\nJan 22, 2018, 8:43 pm\nJan 22, 2018, 5:37 pm\nDaughter of the Church\nJesus Christ is the first born of men since He opened the way to eternal life.\nAdam was the first man, but he died. He got repurchased, as well as many of his offspring, by the death and resurrection of the God-Man Jesus Christ.\nThe repurchase of men by the Christ through the Cross is the only acceptable one to God, since Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and, only a God may pay an other God.\nJesus the Son of God is also born as a man through the Virgin Mary, His own creature. It was necessary to God to take the nature of man in order to accomplish an acceptable redemption.\nThe human nature of God could not suffer the original sin. This is the why of the Virgin conceived without sin, such as Eve had been. Eve sinned, and dragged Adam into sin. Holy Mary did not sin, and so did Jesus Christ. Holy Mary, through her humility and obedience to the will of God, has taken part to the redemption through her own sufferings before and after the 33 years of the Christ’s sufferings on earth.\nAdam and Eve were at the root of mankind’s separation from God. Jesus and Mary are the key to the reconciliation with God.\nThe original sin was committed by both the first man and the first woman. The original sin as well as all the subsequent sins were redeemed by both the First Born of Man Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary, the Christ’s mother who may be called the first born woman since she is assumed into heaven (Catholic dogma). This is why Holy Mary is called the New Eve.\nThe term “born again” deprived of the humanity of Jesus, by ignoring the role of the Mother is vain.\nJan 22, 2018, 2:13 am\nSpoken like a TRUE (brainwashed) Catholic girl… Where in the canonized NT does it state that Mary:\n1. Is the Queen of Heaven ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_Heaven ),\n2. Is the Co-Redemptrix ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-Redemptrix ),\n3. Is worthy of prayer to her ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary ),\n4. Is our intercessor ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercession_of_the_Theotokos ),\n5. Was conceived immaculately ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immaculate_Conception ),\n7. Is a perpetual virgin ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_virginity_of_Mary ), or\n8. Is currently in Heaven [i.e., her Assumption] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary )?\nIn fact, it doesn’t.  The only superlative given to Miryam, who the RCC calls Mary, was that she was “blessed among women.” The NT states that Joshua, who the RCC calls Jesus, had four brothers and at least two sisters.  Ya’akov (Jacob), who the RCC calls James, was so prominent that he made the decision regarding Gentile believers at the First Council of Jerusalem; he was one of the four brothers.\nYou are following the “mysteries” of yet ANOTHER mother goddess religion.  #WakeUp\nJan 22, 2018, 6:12 am\nMr. End begins,\nWhen was Jesus Christ born again, He was born the first time as flesh. When Jesus was baptized by John that event Jesus was not “born again”, remember Christ was here to show us the path to eternal life and one step in that path is to join Christ is His death symbolically by being buried into that watery grave with HIM.\nWhen God the Father raised Jesus from death Christ came up from the Grave, from death as Spirit i.e. that ONE Spirit of the Father is now in Christ.\nThe resurrection TO life is the final step into eternal life:  The resurrection is our birth to LIFE, that is when we are — born again — and that is when we will be like wind – invisible we will BE Spirit.\nPaul is, on purpose, very hard to understand.\nLets look at Galatians 3 closely\n23 “But before faith came, —- before Christ rose from death we were kept under the law,” — we all were held “under” the penalty of death for our transgressions of the Law i.e. because we are sinners we have been sentenced to death. We were kept under the penalty of death.\nshut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. — We were blocked from any possibility of salvation until our Passover was revealed.\n24 “Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith”. — The Law of sacrificing animals was our schoolmaster that led us to our Passover Jesus Christ, Our Passover died for our sins. And Now we can be justified by that ONE sacrifice of Christ.\n25 “But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.” — after our Passover died for us we no longer  sacrifice animals as to continue to sacrifice animals makes that ONE sacrifice of our savior of no avail to us. That one sacrifice of Christ was what the sacrificial law pointed to and that law was our schoolmaster leading us to that ONE sacrifice of Christ.\n26 “For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus”. – Because we have joined our Passover into His death, burial and resurrection symbolically we are all now children of God waiting to be born again into the exact body as our savior Jesus Christ has now.\n27 ” For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.”–As many as have joined in the death of Christ and His resurrection are putting on the image of Christ.\n28 ‘There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.’ —Now we are still male and female but once we are born again we will be exactly like Jesus Christ neither bond nor free nor Jew or Gentile or even male or female – we will be Immortal Spirit as is our Savior.\n29 “And if ye [be] Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise. ‘–If you gentiles have joined Christ in death, burial and resurrection then you are grafted in to the seed of Abraham and now heirs to the Promises of God.\nJan 22, 2018, 6:03 am\n“Now The End Begins” is just another KJV-only, NT-only Christian who mixes up so many things that it’s not even worth dissecting.  He believes he knows so much when, in fact, he knows very little.  Until he starts studying the OT from a Hebraic perspective, the NT will not make sense to him.  He’s still drinking milk when he should be on solid food…\nJan 22, 2018, 7:02 am\nAnonymous\nGood article, and thank you. (This is BIN. Are you running a fever?)\nJust something that, for years, I’ve been pressed to want to share is that a fundamental dividing line between true and false believers is whether one has actually repented before God, changed his or her mind and come into agreement with God, the Lord Jesus, as to the very personal issues of sin guilt and being spiritually dead in Adam you refer to in the article.\nThere are many false believers who believe spouting doctrine, and, by far, bad doctrine, that some lip service to Christ, some intellectual assent to a few scripture points, can save. Of course, this is simply hollow religion, not true faith and worship of God, John 4:23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him.\nGod does not put new wine into old bottles, and one has nothing to do with Jesus Christ, absent being born of the Spirit of Christ, something which must begin with repentance, like the sorrowful publican of Luke 18:13 that felt unworthy to lift his eyes towards heaven the only one who went away justified, a seeking of God in truth and real humiliation as to the sin issue and turning from sin, from self, that dead and vile creature, seeking transformation from God, Matthew 7:7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. But, absent repentance, one has not even come to agreement with God as to the very issues!\nYou can’t come to God, preferring to remain dead and a child of the devil, think you’ll somehow receive salvation, when you don’t even really agree with God, can’t serve two masters: you can’t come to the Savior, and skip on the Lord part. This error is, in fact, what is going to damn a huge number of fake Christians, of lukewarm and worthless religion, or all the creatures of self, blinded with a cult zeal for false doctrines, those, in fact, workers of iniquity that do not know Christ in the first place, that He neither knows, Matthew 7:22-23.\nAs usual, you see all sorts in comments sections that are even puffed-up against scripture truth and disdain all bearers of truth that, in fact, are unrepentant children of the devil, 2 Timothy 3:7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Most all of you need to repent, or you and all your false doctrine will only lead you to hell. God is not mocked. And, by the way, you don’t fool the truly born again, with all your dumb lies. Funny how all of you always come around, like Satan himself, to dispute any article with too much truth, often with anger against truth. Part of your delusion is how you actually think you can fool those with eyes to see and ears to hear, when, in fact, you only fool each other, the already fooled, Luke 6:39 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?\nRepentance, “Don’t leave home without it.” It’s high time most of you stopped faking it, as you’re one heartbeat away from eternal hell fire.\nREPENTANCE\nWord Origin: Greek, Noun Feminine\na change of mind, as it appears to one who repents, of a purpose he has formed or of something he has done; change in one’s way of life resulting from penitence or spiritual conversion; especially the change of mind of those who have begun to abhor their errors and misdeeds, and have determined to enter upon a better course of life, so that it embraces both a recognition of sin and sorrow for it and hearty amendment, the tokens and effects of which are good deeds; that change of mind by which we turn from, desist from, the old behavior; a reversal of decision\nLuke 13\n1 There were present at that season some who told Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.\n2 And Jesus answered and said to them, “Do you suppose that these Galileans were worse sinners than all other Galileans, because they suffered such things?\n3 I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.\n4 Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were worse sinners than all other men who dwelt in Jerusalem?\n5 I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.”\nActs 17\n30 Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent,\n31 because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.\nActs 2\n36 “Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.”\n37 Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Men and brethren, what shall we do?”\n38 Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\n39 For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.”\n1 Corinthians 15\n1 Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand,\n2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you — unless you believed in vain.\n3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,\n4 and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,\n5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.\n6 After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep.\n7 After that He was seen by James, then by all the apostles.\n8 Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time.\n9 For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.\n10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.\n11 Therefore, whether it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.\nThis is not a joke, the imperative that you repent and believe in the Lord Jesus to each and everyone.\nMatthew 18:9 And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be cast into hell fire.\nYou commenting corpses, that have never really repented and received the Lord Jesus? Again, you are just one little heartbeat removed from hell fire. This makes everything else you rail and bicker about, everyday, your fake religion errors, your politics, your conspiracies and paranoid delusions, completely insignificant, when you have a problem looming that will be an eternal, personal disaster, standing right in front of you.\n2 Corinthians 6:2 For He says: “In an acceptable time I have heard you, And in the day of salvation I have helped you.” Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.\nJan 22, 2018, 9:16 am\nGordon\nThere is a doctrine of having been born again but there is also a lifestyle that confirms it. When the Word speaks to us about a transition from a fleshly religion to one based upon the Spirit of God (Born again) then he is talking about away of life that is always set before us. We can either trust with fleshly reason or we can trust the Spirit for all things. Confirmation that this is away of life can be seen in Paul the Apostles message in\nRomans 8:11-14 And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you. Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation—but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it. For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live. For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God.\nMore on the subject at http://beforeitsnews.com/christian-news/2017/12/christian-youre-supposed-to-be-dead-4-2560337.html\nJan 22, 2018, 10:41 am\nwheeties\ngod does not care about any of your childish  nonsense–it is only a debate in your own immature infantile brain–it goes nowhere–it means nothing–god does not play in your ass backwards world–god is way above your human bs–but keep it up,its entertaining,kind of like watching the 3 stooges\nJan 22, 2018, 12:49 pm\nwheeties\nnice little fantasy eh….god does not care about your little tale of bs..your condenscending tale of doing this or that is your childish attempt at playing god–why dont you stick to your superman or batman fantasy–its more believable..god does not read the bible–never has–never will–god did not write it either–some insane homeless dudes in a cave wrote it inspired by satan not god==the word of men–not god–the bible is the book of wrath and judgement—god has no wrath nor judgement–only stupid infantile,immature bible thumpers,christians have wrath,judgement because they are the agents of satan–god loves all his stupid humans,even bible thumpers,,jesus told us salvation is for all and the bible thumpers of his day killed him for saying that because it reduced their power and cash flow–the bible thumpers of today would do the same being they are evil,hateful bastards from hell..\nJan 22, 2018, 12:57 pm\nJan 22, 2018, 8:17 pm\nNO RELIGION IS REQUIRED!
