        "text": "By Moonbattery (Reporter)\nWhy Sandwiches Must Be Banned\nThursday, January 25, 2018 9:09\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nNever mind transportation and power generation. We can address the global warming crisis by having the United Nations ban sandwiches :\nResearchers at the University of Manchester calculated the carbon footprint of 40 different types of sandwiches – both home-made and pre-packaged – taking account how the ingredients were produced, the packaging, as well as food waste discarded at home and elsewhere in the supply chain. …\nProfessor Adisa Azapagic, from the university’s School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Sciences, said: “Given that sandwiches are a staple of the British diet as well as their significant market share in the food sector, it is important to understand the contribution from this sector to the emissions of greenhouse gases.\n“For example, consuming 11.5 billion sandwiches annually in the UK generates, on average, 9.5 million tonnes of CO2 eq, equivalent to the annual use of 8.6 million cars.”\nNext, the experts will issue an official report on precisely how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.\nAlthough banning sandwiches would be ideal, eating stale sandwiches instead of fresh ones could help save the planet.\nThe [British Sandwich Association] estimates that extending the shelf life of sandwiches could reduce waste by more than 2,000 tonnes a year.\nProf Azapagic said: “We need to change the labelling of food to increase the use-by date as these are usually quite conservative.”\nSo the sandwich is dried out and chewy; it won’t necessarily make you sick. Do your part for the planet and shun fresh sandwiches, until progressives acquire the political leverage to ban sandwiches altogether.\nOn a tip from KirklesWorth.\nOrder by Phone at 888-809-8385 or online at www.mitocopper.com\nGet our Free Ebook, \"Suppressed Health Secrets\"   with  Natural Cures THEY don't want you to know!\nAPeX - Far superior to colloidal silver!  Destroys Viruses, Bacteria, Pathogens with Oxygen plus Silver!\nSupreme Fulvic - Nature's most important supplement!
