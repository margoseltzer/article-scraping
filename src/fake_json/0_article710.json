In a time when online business has disrupted the retail market and big box stores are diminishing by the dozen, it doesn’t seem wise to polarize your customer base with a divisive stance – as Target seems to have learned the hard way.\nHowever, Lowe’s is not one of these stores and simply stays true to their core values and the American people.\nWe saw this from the major home improvement retailer a couple of months ago when they went against the trend of catering to Islam with what they pulled from their stores. Now, we’re seeing it again in an even bigger way that proves there is a positive way to make a statement and it’s left military families in America in total shock.\nWhat many American businesses, sports figures, and celebrities get routinely wrong is that they make political statements in vain to say they are against division, when they are really being an anti-American and perpetuating the problem. This often includes using their platform to publicly trash our president.\nLowes knows that while they may offend “some” people, they are promoting something better with their patriotism that we as a country can and should all get behind.\nIn this recent move, they are showing their appreciation in a big way for the men and women who fight for our freedom and right to make any social statement we want, with what’s coming to all their stores across the nation for military families.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!

Lowe’s changed this policy a year or more ago and expanded it to include honorably discharged veterans, as well.  It already had included disabled veterans as long as they could prove it.\nJan 18, 2018, 8:54 pm\nGivys\nIn that spirit of freedom, I am telling you that  my browser, I.E., is censoring your main page.
