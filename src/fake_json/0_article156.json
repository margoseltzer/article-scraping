        "text": "By Lisa Haven\nBang! Secret FISA Memo Released...You Won’t Believe What's Inside…\nWednesday, January 24, 2018 13:14\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\n \nWilliam Binney, former tech head of the NSA contacted Infowars on Wednesday morning and sent them a link to the reportedly classified memo that lawmakers said was a blueprint of how the Obama administration and the Deep State spied on President Trump.\nThis memo serves as the basis for the four-page FISA memo that multiple Republicans are calling to be released #RelaseTheMemo. It is not the actually four-page memo, but again, the basis for it. All that and more in this breaking report…\nHere are some of the NSA abuses listed in this MEMO:\nPage 15 – “…NSA analysts had used US-person identifiers to query the results on Internet ‘upstream’ collection, even though NSA’s Section 702 minimization procedures prohibited such queries.”\nPage 19 – “Since 2011, NSA’s minimization procedures have prohibited use of US-person identifiers to query the results of upstream Internet collection under Section 702. The Oct. 26, 2016, Notice informed the Court that NSA analysts had been conducting such queries in violation of that prohibition, with much greater frequency than had previously been disclosed to the Court.”\nPage 21 – “The government still had not ascertained the full range of systems that might have been used to conduct improper US-person queries.”\nPage 29 – “The elimination of ‘abouts’ collection and, consequently, the more problematic forms of MCTs, focuses Section 702 acquisitions more sharply on communications to or from Section 702 targets, who are reasonably believed to be non-US persons outside the United States and expected to receive or communicate foreign intelligence information. That sharper focus should have the effect that US person information acquired under Section 702 will come more predominantly from non-domestic communications that are relevant to the foreign intelligence needs on which the pertinent targeting decisions were based.”\nPage 33 – “…it’s unlikely to contain as high proportion of Information acquired by FISA electronic surveillance and physical search, which often involve target who are United States persons and typically are directed at persons in the United States.”\nOrder by Phone at 888-809-8385 or online at www.mitocopper.com\nGet our Free Ebook, \"Suppressed Health Secrets\"   with  Natural Cures THEY don't want you to know!\nAPeX - Far superior to colloidal silver!  Destroys Viruses, Bacteria, Pathogens with Oxygen plus Silver!\nSupreme Fulvic - Nature's most important supplement!
