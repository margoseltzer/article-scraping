        "text": "By Daily Wealth\nThursday, January 25, 2018 5:34\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nEverything’s up!\nHeck, everything is up a bit too much lately, right? People are starting to feel good about their investments again…\nIs there any sector or asset that hasn’t soared?\nActually, yes…\nWhile stocks have soared seemingly nonstop for years, this major investment class has performed downright terribly. Take a look:\nYear\nReturn\n2011\n-10.7%\n2012\n-3.2%\n2013\n-13.2%\n2014\n2.6%\n2015\n-17.2%\n2016\n-3.1%\n2017\n-6.1%\nIn six of the last seven calendar years, this investment has lost money.\nAnd in 2014 – the one year that it managed a positive gain – it only went up 2.6%.\nWhile stocks have absolutely soared, this investment has lost nearly half its value since its 2011 peak.\nWhat is this asset class? It’s agricultural commodities…\nSpecifically, those are the returns for the PowerShares DB Agriculture Fund (DBA).\nIt holds a broadly diversified portfolio of agricultural commodity futures. Here’s the latest breakdown of its top holdings:\nCommodity\nWeight\nSoybeans\n12.9%\nCorn\n12.7%\nWheat\n12.5%\n12.5%\nSugar\n12.0%\nCoffee\n10.9%\nCocoa\n10.2%\nYou might imagine – after seven years of bad returns – that investors have given up on these commodities. You would be right…\nJason Goepfert of SentimenTrader.com does excellent work analyzing investor sentiment. And these days, basically all these agricultural commodities are at the bottom of his scale.\nNobody likes them… And that gets me interested!\nI love to buy what’s cheap and hated. It’s incredibly challenging these days to find an asset class that fits both.\nBut after a severe seven-year bear market, agricultural commodities might just be the most hated asset class.\nThey are cheap. They are hated. They are just missing the final piece before I’ll pull the trigger… We don’t have a real “uptrend” in sight – yet.\nEveryone has given up.\nThis is the position where big gains start.\nI’m not bold enough – yet – to be a buyer. But I will be a buyer when we finally see an uptrend.\nIf you’re looking for a hated asset that can rise whether stocks are going up or down, then you’d better put agricultural commodities on your watch list.\nShares of DBA are the easiest way to play it, once the uptrend finally returns…\nGood investing,\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
