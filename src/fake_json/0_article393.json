        "text": "By RedState (Reporter)\nTotal:\nComplaint Filed Over Alleged Payoff to Trump’s Porn Star Mistress\nMonday, January 22, 2018 11:09\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nThis seems like a stretch.\nCommon Cause is a non-profit watchdog group and they’ve apparently been watching the porn star story closely.\nAt least, close enough to determine that the alleged $130,000 payoff by Trump attorney Michael Cohen violates federal campaign finance laws.\nThe group has filed a complaint with the Justice Department and Federal Election Commission.\nCommon Cause said in its  complaints  that Michael Cohen’s alleged $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels was an unreported in-kind contribution to the president’s 2016 campaign.\nThe organization called on the Justice Department and FEC to “fully investigate” the possible violation.\nThey just want more salacious details than what was revealed in the 2011 In Touch Magazine interview.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on the alleged payoff last week, saying Cohen used a pseudonym and funneled the money to Daniels through a private company.\nThis seems like a really futile attempt to tie Trump’s affair to anything more than his horrid character. Unless they can prove campaign funds were used to pay off the mistress, I think they’re going to see their efforts frustrated.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
