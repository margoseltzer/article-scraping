        "text": "By Philosophers Stone\nMel Gibson: Hollywood Elites ‘Kill Innocent Children & Drink Their Blood’\nWednesday, January 24, 2018 0:35\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nMovie star blows the whistle on entertainment industry pedophile ring\nIn a shocking exposé, movie star Mel Gibson has blown the whistle on the epidemic of “parasites” who “control Hollywood” that are involved in child sacrifice and pedophilia.The Lethal Weapon star said that “every studio in Hollywood is bought and paid for with the blood of innocent children,” adding that the “most valuable currency is the blood of babies.”\nWhile in London, England promoting his latest role in Daddy’s Home 2, Gibson described entertainment industry elites as an “enemy to mankind” who “feast on the blood of innocent children.”He said key players in the movie business “get their kicks from destroying the sanctuary of children” as they “thrive on breaking every God-given taboo known to man.”\n“They have a blatant disregard for the good of the people.”Destroying people’s lives is just a game to them – the more pain they can cause, the better the thrill.”Children a just sustenance to them.”They feast on the pain and fear, and the younger, the better.” “These people follow their own religion and use it for moral guidance.”It’s not the sort of religious teachings you folks would ever hear about.”They perform sacred rituals that are sick and totally at odds with the moral fabric that binds most patriotic Americans.”The worst part: It’s an open secret in Hollywood and everyone wants in on it.”\nMel Gibson appeared on British prime-time BBC chatshow, The Graham Norton Show on Friday, where the veteran actor answered questions from shocked guests, in the green room backstage after his appearance, regarding the true nature of Hollywood “elites.” He explained how he had been blacklisted by Hollywood’s controlling oligarchs in 2006 for voicing his opinions about the industry that clashed with their liberal agenda.He said that since then he has been “working outside of the system” which has given him a fresh perspective, saying:\n“It’s difficult to comprehend, I know, and I’m sorry that I am the one to break this to you, but Hollywood is an institutionalized pedophile ring.”They use and abuse kids for their own sick ‘spiritual beliefs,’ if you can even call them that. “I don’t fully understand it myself, but they harvest these kids for their energy and feast on their blood.”They don’t do it mercifully either, they scare the sh*t out of them before they sacrifice them.\n“The more innocent the child, the more terrified they are, the more they thrive on it,” said the Braveheart star. “What does that mean? “They aren’t doing this as some form of artistic expression: They are harvesting the blood of children and eating their flesh because they think it gives them some sort of ‘life force.’”If the child was mentally and physically suffering when they died, then it gives them ‘extra life force.’”I don’t understand why they do that, but that’s what they do.”Most of us have a moral compass that guides us through life, right?”\nThese people don’t have that, or if they do, it’s pointing in the opposite direction.”\nGibson, who has spent the last 30 years working inside and outside of the Hollywood regime, says that the industry’s hierarchy “thrives on abuse, pain, torture, stress, and suffering.”According to Gibson, the desire to inflict such abuse isn’t limited to just the elite, but only “those at the top of the food chain can afford such a ‘luxury,’” although, it’s a “goal for most people in the industry.”\nOrder by Phone at 888-809-8385 or online at www.mitocopper.com\nGet our Free Ebook, \"Suppressed Health Secrets\"   with  Natural Cures THEY don't want you to know!\nAPeX - Far superior to colloidal silver!  Destroys Viruses, Bacteria, Pathogens with Oxygen plus Silver!\nSupreme Fulvic - Nature's most important supplement!
