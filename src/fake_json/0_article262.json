Add your two cents.\nAccording to accepted history, the Great Pyramid was built around 2500 BC as the tomb of Pharaoh Khufu. However, the dating of the Pyramid and its association with Khufu is entirely based on the discovery made in 1837 by the British explorer Richard William Howard Vyse (was a British soldier, anthropologist, and Egyptologist. Richard Vyse discovered four small “construction” rooms (with heights between 0.5 meters and 1.2 meters) above the King’s Chamber. Egyptologists were then able to attribute the great Pyramid to Khufu , and construction date of 2500 BC because that`s when they believe Khufu reigned. Since the stones can not be carbon-dated and there is no other inscription in the pyramid except for that cartridge, this dating can not be challenged. However, new evidence that has been found in Colonel Vyse journal ask researchers questioning his discovery, some have even suggested that he may be forged the name of Khufu, himself. In Vyse’s private journal its find contradictions. In his private notes, he was desperate to find a cartouche. On this particular night, he writes, there was nothing in the chamber that looks like hieroglyphics. And then, in his published book three years later he writes: “I could only make out one cartouche”.\nOrder by Phone at 888-809-8385 or online at www.mitocopper.com\nGet our Free Ebook, \"Suppressed Health Secrets\"   with  Natural Cures THEY don't want you to know!\nAPeX - Far superior to colloidal silver!  Destroys Viruses, Bacteria, Pathogens with Oxygen plus Silver!\nSupreme Fulvic - Nature's most important supplement!
