Add your two cents.\nAssignment Asserted Christians, Muslims and Jews believe in the same God.\nDozens of people spoke against a homework assignment in an Elgin, Illinois school meeting. http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/elgin-courier-news/news/ct-ecn-u46-religion-assignment-st-0124-20180123-story.html Is it just a matter of opinion?\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis writer has seen a YouTube video of a little boy having a car drive over his arm because he stole a loaf of bread.
