        "text": "By silveristhenew (Reporter)\nTotal:\nGowdy Eviscerates Andrew McCabe: “I’ll Be Surprised If He’s Still An Employee Of The FBI By This Time Next Week”\nFriday, December 15, 2017 17:17\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nOnce again echoing the dinner conversations of a growing number of American households around the country, Representative Trey Gowdy (R-SC) ripped into FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on Fox News regarding text messages released earlier this week between Agent Peter Strzok and lawyer Lisa Page that revealed an FBI plot, allegedly hatched in McCabe’s office, to prevent a Trump presidency at all costs.  Among other things, Gowdy said he would be somewhat shocked if McCabe was still an employee of the FBI “by this time next week.”\n“I’m still trying to figure out why 3 FBI agents are discussing politics in the Deputy Director’s office because you’re not supposed to discuss politics on Federal ground.  And FBI agents aren’t supposed to engage in politics for Hatch Act reasons.”\n“Remember, we were supposed to interview Andy McCable yesterday on another committee.  It was all setup and ready to go and then at the last minute they said he can’t come.  I’ll be shocked if he comes next week.  I’ll be a little bit surprised if he’s still and employee of the FBI this time next week.”\n“But the notion that 3 bureau agents would be conspiring or plotting on how to handle the outcome of a presidential election is the opposite of what you want in an objective, dispassionate, neutral FBI.”\nTrey Gowdy on Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe: “I’ll be a little bit surprised if he is still an employee of the FBI this time next week.” pic.twitter.com/v9SZxp443P\nFor those who aren’t familiar with the text messages in question, here is the text that Agent Peter Strzok sent to FBI lawyer Lisa Page, a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair, last summer:\nText-from Peter Strzok to Lisa Page (Andy is Andrew McCabe): “I want to believe the path u threw out 4 consideration in Andy’s office-that there’s no way he gets elected-but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk.It’s like an insurance policy in unlikely event u die be4 you’re 40”\nMeanwhile, if there is anyone out there who still harbors any remaining doubt that Special Counsel Mueller’s probe is anything but a farcical, politically-motivated witch hunt, then we highly recommend you also view this Trey Gowdy gem from earlier this week during a hearing with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. \nOf course, only time will tell if Gowdy is just engaging in some self-serving political grandstanding or if he’s intent upon firing some swamp creatures.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
