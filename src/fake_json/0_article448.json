        "text": "Total:\nMuslim Newsweek Editor says sexual abuse of children “will always exist” and it leads to “great art”\nTuesday, January 23, 2018 21:17\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nClearly this Newsweek editor is a follower of Mohammad, the “perfect model”(whose favorite wife was six when he married her). Child rape is rampant in Muslim countries so the editor of Newsweek Pakistan advises us to get over it and look for the silver lining. In this case “great art.” Such an idea is repulsive and vomit-inducing. I know of no such art, it must be one of those Muslim things we are compelled to “respect” by their running dogs on the left (in this case, Newsweek).\nThe sexual abuse of children will always exist. You can never eliminate it. Sometimes it leads to great art. So there’s also that.\n“Islam has no age barrier in marriage and Muslims have no apology for those who refuse to accept this” — Ishaq Akintola , professor of Islamic Eschatology and Director of Muslim Rights Concern, Nigeria\n“There is no minimum marriage age for either men or women in Islamic law. The law in many countries permits girls to marry only from the age of 18. This is arbitrary legislation, not Islamic law.” — Dr. Abd Al-Hamid Al-‘Ubeidi , Iraqi expert on Islamic law\nThere is no minimum age for marriage and that girls can be married “even if they are in the cradle.” — Dr. Salih bin Fawzan , prominent cleric and member of Saudi Arabia’s highest religious council\n“Islam does not forbid marriage of young children.” — Pakistan’s Council of Islamic Ideology\nNewssweek Pakistan Editor: Child Molestation Sometimes ‘Leads to Great Art’\nBy Amber Randall, Civil Rights Reporter, Daily Caller, January 23, 2018:\nThe editor of Newsweek Pakistan made the bold claim that child molestation sometimes leads to great art in a Tuesday tweet.\nFasih Ahmed, editor and publisher of Newsweek Pakistan, claimed that child molestation will always exists and will always continue, regardless of outrage or campaigns against it.\n“The sexual abuse of children will always exist. You can never eliminate it. Sometimes it leads to great art. So there’s also that,” Ahmed said, before referencing a #MeToo movement in Pakistan launched by the rape and murder of a 7-year-old girl.\nThe sexual abuse of children will always exist. You can never eliminate it. Sometimes it leads to great art. So there’s also that.\nChild sexual abuse has always happened, is happening, and will always continue. Two days of outrage on Twitter and participating in a 10-person vigil may make you feel so noble but that’s all just about you, not those who’ve been victimized\nYou know uncles, servants, teachers, cousins, random shopkeepers hurt boys and girls. Did you report them? Did you have the balls to step out of your denial? This is the cause du jour. Default mode denial is just around the corner. Zainab is not a watershed moment\nAfter facing outrage over Twitter about his comments, Ahmed stressed that they were his own comments and he had not been hacked.\nMy account has not been hacked. Relax\nAn Associated Press report noted that Islamic schools in Pakistan are rife with sexual abuse of young boys, with the Associated Press reportedly finding hundreds of cases where clerics had inappropriately touched children over the past 10 years.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
