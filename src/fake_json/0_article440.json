        "text": "By Paul Wallin\nTotal:\nA Certificate of Rehabilitation May Help You Be Removed from Internet Disclosure\nTuesday, January 23, 2018 19:07\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nIf you are convicted of a sex crime in California, you face extremely harsh penalties. Not only do you face prison time and expensive fines, you also face lifetime registration as a sex offender. Under Megan’s Law, your name and personal information will appear on a public website for anyone to see.\nThis punishment could feel like having a scarlet letter permanently attached to you. That is why you should speak to an attorney about obtaining a Certificate of Rehabilitation or seeking exclusion from internet disclosure.\nWhat is Megan’s Law?\nMegan’s Law was established as a way to protect children and families by identifying people who potentially pose a danger to the community. The Megan’s Law website is an online database where anyone can access the full name, address and photo of sex offenders.\nThere are a few sex offenses that are excluded from internet disclosure, but chances are that your personal information will appear on the Megan’s Law website if you have been convicted of a sex crime in California. However, there are a couple of paths you may take to have your information removed from Megan’s Law.\nAre You Eligible for Exclusion from Megan’s Law?\nCertain sex offenses are eligible for exclusion from Megan’s Law. As long as you were not sentenced to prison, you may qualify for exclusion from internet disclosure if you were convicted of:\nSexual battery under PC 243.4(a)\nAnnoying or molesting a child under PC 647.6, OR\nAn offense that did not involve oral copulation or actual penetration in which the victim was your child, stepchild, grandchild or sibling, and you have successfully completed (or are successfully completing) probation for the offense\nIf you believe that you qualify for exclusion from Megan’s Law under these circumstances, you should speak to an experienced attorney who can help you submit an application for exclusion with the Department of Justice.\nA Certificate of Rehabilitation Could Help You Be Removed from Megan’s Law\nAnother path to removal from the Megan’s Law site is by obtaining a Certificate of Rehabilitation. A Certificate of Rehabilitation is a court order stating that you have been an upstanding, rehabilitated citizen since you were convicted of a crime.\nObtaining a Certificate of Rehabilitation could provide several benefits to you, including being able to apply for state licensing and telling potential employers that the court has declared you a model citizen since being convicted.\nPerhaps the most important benefit for sex offenders is that a Certificate of Rehabilitation may relieve you of your duty to register as a sex offender under PC 290 depending on the specific crime you were convicted of. This will not only remove your name from the Megan’s Law site, but also allow you to stop registering as a sex offender.\nSpeak to our experienced criminal lawyers at Wallin & Klarich today to find out if you are eligible to apply for a Certificate of Rehabilitation.\nContact Wallin & Klarich for Help Applying for a Certificate of Rehabilitation Now\nHaving your personal information and details about your criminal past posted online for everyone to see can cause you a lifetime of embarrassment and suffering.
