        "text": "By The Pirate's Cove (Reporter)\nTotal:\nSurprise: Socialist Hotbed Of Venezuela Has Lost Half It’s Economy\nThursday, January 25, 2018 8:50\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nQuite frankly, I’m surprised it has half left. This is a country that cannot even produce toilet paper and beer . And they’re stealing zoo animals for food . Here we have a Progressive/Marxist/Socialist station (CNN) telling us about how bad things are in a PMS nation\nIt’s getting worse. Unemployment will reach 30% and prices on all types of goods in the country will rise 13,000% this year, according to new figures published Thursday by the International Monetary Fund.\nThe IMF’s economist for the Western Hemisphere, Alejandro Werner, put Venezuela’s future bluntly.\n“In Venezuela, the crisis continues,” Werner said in a blog post. He added that inflation is skyrocketing this year because of “the loss of confidence in the nation’s currency.”\nThis year will mark the third consecutive year of double-digit contractions in Venezuela’s gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity. The nation’s GDP declined 16% in 2016, 14% last year and it’s projected to fall 15% this year, according to the IMF.\nVenezuela is deep into an economic, political and humanitarian crisis, largely inflicted by the government’s own policies, economists say. Food and medical shortages are widespread. People are scavenging for food in dumpsters. Citizens are fleeing by the thousands. The currency, the bolivar, is  nearly worthless . The government has defaulted on its debt. World leaders are calling President Nicolas Maduro a dictator.\nAnd what policies are those? PMS ones. Big, dominating, controlling government ones. Similar to the same ones Democrats push. The darling of the Left’s last primary season, Bernie Sanders, also a favorite of the young Democrat voters, espouses policies not that dissimilar from Maduro’s, and Hugo Chavez before him.\nIf it wasn’t for fossil fuels, Venezuela would probably be in the same shape as Somalia.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
