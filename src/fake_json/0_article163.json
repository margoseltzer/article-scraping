For a reliable low cost alternative try the CZ-82 military version.  Light weight 9mm Mak, 12+1 round, small and very concealable, well balanced and has double action first round so you can keep it racked with the hammer down.  The barrel is hexagonal instead of rifled and it’s VERY accurate.  Large calibers = large groups and slow rate of fire.  This handgun is my personal favorite for conceal carry over all those you mentioned.\nJan 25, 2018, 9:34 am\nCLICK HERE TO UPLOAD NEWS!\n\"Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the  Lord of hosts.\"  Zechariah 4:6\nRead it..\nSubmit\nToday's Top Stories\nTop Global\nTop Alternative\nPortions copyright © 2019 NSearch Technology, Inc., All Rights Reserved.\nBefore It's News® is a registered Service Mark of NSearch Technology,     Inc..\nLooks like you’re using an ad-blocker.\nThis site is supported by ads.
