Add your two cents.\nConspiracy, Mystery, And Comedy. Boom. Today, Greg Carlwood hosts Mike Sententia In the most recent installment of everyone’s favorite fringe podcast. Spelling it out for us on his popular website, Magick of Thought, Sententia has been working on one of the most straightforward and practical brand of magick appropriately dubbed “Direct Magick”.  We’ve seen the pattern of powerful people belonging to various groups that utilize magick & the magical arts, and covered through the course of multiple shows some of these magical practices. Today we attempt to even the scales once again, expand our knowledge base and add these esoteric tools to our repertoire. With the help of today’s guest, we are able approach this topic with ease as he breaks down the barriers and helps create accessibility for the common folk. So throw off the silly robes and get ready as they step outside the traditional rituals and explore the underlying phenomenon hidden deep in the belly of the beast. 2:00 Join Greg and Mike as they use the science and mechanisms behind real magick to take a closer look at what the moving pieces are and how can we work with them directly to produce the results we are looking for. The common practice among most modalities involves using ritual to create a symbolic action as a technique for engaging the unconscious mind to communicate intent to it. The focus of Direct Magick is the process that lays beyond conveying intent, and connecting to the unconscious. By implementing this modality and awakening our ethereal muscles, we can begin to refine and guide our unconscious, leading to better and more effective results. 8:15 Listen as Greg and Mike discuss the journey from magick as an abstract interest to the cultivation of a set of skills that is not only reliable, but useful and effective. Mike explains that through his approach to magick, we can begin to better understand the mechanism behind magical experiences known as ethereal software, which is the force that responds to a person’s intent. 21:45 The term ethereal software is essentially the mechanism that spirit’s use to help with our requests. Whilst the terminology ethereal software may be new, it is derived from and expands on ancient practices like Chaos Magic and it’s use of egregores and servitors, or external forces that magick channel for help. 31:00 Establishing lasting, reliable, and meaningful relationships with entities can be challenging. Listen as Mike gives Greg his advice on the best steps one can take to begin building a line of communication such as quieting the mind, incorporating sensory connections, and engaging with the ethereal muscles. 38:30 Greg and Mike discuss the evolution of a relationship with an entity and exactly what that may look like. From contacting random spirits using ethereal software, to moving beyond over time and connecting with a spirit who specializes in communication, Mike details his experience for listeners. Mike also helps offer insight into what implications this has on a spiritual level, how this has molded his paradigm, and what the reality of these spirits may include. 49:10 The Healing Lab has made it it’s mission to develop a scientific understanding of energy healing,energy medications and exploring aberrations that can’t be explained using mainstream science. Energy healing, otherwise known as biofield healing, studies have been conducted and show significant results supporting the existence of this phenomena. 1:01:00 Greg and Mike discuss the limitations of energy healing by distinguishing the limits given today’s technology, as well as ultimate fundamental limits. Mike contends that energy healing either accelerates or slows cellular processes, and can be utilized to help subtly increase or decrease these processes in various tissues or organs. However, as Mike asserts, limitations are inherent as this could never replace surgery. 1:12:00 Listen as Greg and Mike get more into energy psychology as they discuss the type of visua…\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
