Personal Defense Strategies, LLC\nWilderness Medicine\nFebruary 16-18, 2018\nMurphy, NC\nBy definition, “Wilderness Medicine” is based on the concepts of emergency medical help when separated from definitive care by distance, time, or other circumstances.  That situation could easily be the backcountry, another snowpocalypse, civil unrest, or an active shooter incident; all situations in which medical help may not be readily available.\nWilderness Medicine is training in emergency first aid for people who aren’t professionals and forms the basis of our tactical medic program.  The training consists of an informal meet and greet on Friday evening followed by two days of lecture, discussion, hands-on, and scenario-based skills practice.\nOur goal is to provide you with an assessment process that is simple, easy to understand, and one that does not require you to purchase everything from an ER catalog.  Rather, the class provides you with a roadmap to address life-threatening injuries in the proper order and one that ensures the best possible outcome for both yourself and your patient.\nAll courses are taught by professional educators and experienced medical providers who will work to make sure that you leave class with the information and skills needed to react with confidence.   Learn to respond to medical emergencies, treat injuries and illnesses, and improvise solutions in a high-risk low-resource environment.\nThe cost of the course is $250 individually or $200 each as a couple.  Advanced, full-payment is required to reserve a seat in class.  Due to limited class enrollment, payment is non-refundable and rescheduling will be allowed for the next available class only if space is available.  Cancellation on the day of the class is considered a “no show.”\nPayment can be made via PayPal at [email protected] or by check to:\nPersonal Defense Strategies, LLC\nBlairsville, GA  30512\nFor more information, contact Rick Klopp at [email protected] or 706.781.4526\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
