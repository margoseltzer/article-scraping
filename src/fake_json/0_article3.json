        "text": "By RedState (Reporter)\nTotal:\nVeteran Commentator Calls Out the Growing “Ethnonationalism” at Fox News (and It’s SO Ugly)\nThursday, January 25, 2018 8:57\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nLet’s be honest: This is pretty much all of Fox News’ commentary portion now, since the network became Trump Pravda.\nCommentator and The Weekly Standard founder, Bill Kristol, sat for an interview with CNBC that was released on Thursday. Among various topics, he noted how Tucker Carlson, a Fox News superstar, has changed since he began with The Weekly Standard.\n“I mean, it is close now to racism, white — I mean, I don’t know if it’s racism exactly — but ethnonationalism of some kind, let’s call it. A combination of dumbing down, as you said earlier, and stirring people’s emotions in a very unhealthy way,” Kristol told CNBC’s John Harwood in the  interview  published on Thursday.\nCarlson has been getting a bit of attention lately from some who are seeing exactly what Kristol is talking about.\nNo, Carlson isn’t dipping to the level of Sean Hannity, or other conspiracy-pushing MAGAdooks, but some of his work has a toe on the line.\nKristol went on to praise Carlson’s early work.\n“Tucker Carlson was a great young reporter. He was one of the most gifted 24-year-olds I’ve seen in the 20 years that I edited the magazine. His copy was sort of perfect at age 24,” Kristol said. “He had always a little touch of Pat Buchananism, I would say, paleo-conservativism.”\nCompare that to what he’s devolved to, while working in the toxic, propaganda atmosphere of Fox News.\nCarlson recently  questioned  the widespread outrage over Trump’s reported comments referring to African nations as “sh*thole countries.”\n“So, if you say Norway is a better place to live and Haiti is kind of a hole, well anyone who’s been to those countries or has lived in them would agree. But we’re jumping up and down, ‘Oh, you can’t say that.’ Why can’t you say that?” Carlson asked.\nBecause Trump’s comments weren’t that simple. He wrapped up the people in the comment when he asked why we couldn’t get more immigrants from Norway. He didn’t ask which place was nicer to visit.\nWhen Trump made the comment, he did so to appeal to a base that is packed full of alt-right, white nationalists, anti-Semites, and neo-Nazis (not all, but far too many to just ignore). Reports are that he called associates and said he thought the comments would appeal to his base. So yes, even though some have played the blind, deaf, and dumb case of, “I don’t recall,” it’s clear he said it.\nAnd it was wrong.\nKristol is right to point out what is happening over at Fox News, as well as to call out those that are falling into the alt-right line of scumbaggery.\nThis isn’t something that we should allow any national news network to make mainstream.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
