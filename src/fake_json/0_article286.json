        "text": "By N. Morgan\nTotal:\nWhile Hollywood Pervs Bask in the Spotlight, Media Oddly Silent About Rampant Sex Abuse by Police (Videos)\nWednesday, November 29, 2017 8:14\n \nThe victims of the Hollywood sex abuse scandals are finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and may get the justice they’ve long deserved.\nHowever, a negative consequence of those scandals surfacing, as the “Weinsteins and the Spaceys” watch their careers crash and burn over the numerous allegations of sexual misconduct, other sex abuse crimes are being virtually ignored by mainstream media, sexual misconduct that is being perpetrated by police officers.\nNearly on a daily basis a cop or former cop’s face makes the local newspaper with obscure headlines like Former Deputy Now Charged with Exploitation . \nThere is hardly any attention is given to these stories despite the horrifying nature of the crimes alleged.\nFor example, the aforementioned headline is from a small Minnesota town and involves a deputy who was arrested on multiple felony charges including child molestation, sexual misconduct with a child, and child exploitation.\nNo other media outlets picked up the story and the disgusting crimes that led to these headlines happen far more frequently than reported. \nEalier this month, two NYPD cops crimes were so bad that they actually made national headlines when they were arrested for allegedly handcuffing an underage teen and brutally raping her in their van.\nWhile Chambers and her mother were at the hospital, nine officers showed up to intimidate them into remaining silent about the violent assault.\n“They came with nine cops to intimidate her and her mom, to discourage them from coming forward and reporting the rape and sex assault,” attorney Michael David, told The Post .\nSo as the NYPD case garnered much-needed attention, others go completely unnoticed and under reported. Cops sexually abusing children, women , and men is common and is a major problem.\nIn 2014, TFTP put out a shocking report that highlighted 40 cops who were convicted or charged with spousal abuse, child rape, or other types of sex crimes just thirty days .\nIndependent researchers began tracking how many people are killed by cops every year, no one was tracking how many crimes were committed by cops. However, that is beginning to change, and the data shows that the problem is staggering.\nLast year, a study exposed the shocking fact that police officers are arrested about 1,100 times a year, or roughly three officers charged every day. Many of these arrests are over unspeakable sex crimes.\n“Police crimes are not uncommon,” the study’s lead researcher Philip M. Stinson concluded. “Our data directly contradicts some of the prevailing assumptions and the proposition that only a small group of rotten apples perpetrate the vast majority of police crime.”\nAlthough nearly 60 percent of the crimes “occurred when the officer was technically off-duty,” Stinson wrote, “a significant portion of these so-called off-duty crimes also lies within the context of police work and the perpetrator’s role as a police officer, including instances where off-duty officers flash a badge, an official weapon, or otherwise use their power, authority, and the respect afforded to them as a means to commit crime.”\nA report done by WaPo found that in cases involving allegations of sexual abuse, 72 percent of the officers were fired, and more than 80 percent resulted in convictions, the study found.\nThere were 422 reported cases of forcible and statutory rape, 352 cases of forcible fondling and 94 sodomy cases over the seven years of the study, which Stinson called “larger than expected based on the existing research.”\nThe data search turned up 174 examples of male officers arrested in cases of “Driving While Female,” in which women drivers were harassed or assaulted. About 82 percent of those cases ended in convictions.\nA separate study as reported by the AP in 2015 found similarly startling numbers.\nAP’s probe revealed that 550 officers lost their certification status for various sexual assaults, including rape.\nSome were dismissed for sodomy or sexual shakedowns, where victims were forced to perform sexual acts to avoid arrest.\nAnother 440 officers lost their jobs for other sex-related offenses, such as possessing child pornography, being a peeping Tom, sending sexually charged messages to underage teens or having sex while on duty.\nAbout one-third of the officers lost their jobs for committing sexual offenses with juveniles.\nIn yet another independent study concluded that sexual misconduct is the second highest of all complaints nationwide against police officers, representing 9.3 percent in 2010, according to a study by the Cato Institute’s National Police Misconduct Reporting Project.\nIn 2010, 354 of the 618 complaints involved nonconsensual sexual acts, and over half of those involved were minors.\nPerhaps the most chilling aspect of police sexual misconduct is the likelihood of the media remaining silence on the crimes.\nAs in the case of the NYPD cops intimidating the rape victim shows, police officers stand up for their own—even if it means protecting a rapist.\nWhen a person becomes a victim of police sex crimes, how can they be expected to go to the very people who employ their abuser and report it — especially given the fact that it is well known police will go to great lengths to protect their own.\n“It’s happening probably in every law enforcement agency across the country,” said Chief Bernadette DiPino of the Sarasota Police Department in Florida, who helped study the problem for the International Association of Chiefs of Police.\n“It’s so underreported and people are scared that if they call and complain about a police officer, they think every other police officer is going to be then out to get them.”\nWhile it is certainly newsworthy to expose Hollywood pedophiles and sex abusers for preying on vulnerable actors and actresses, the level at which police sexual misconduct is ignored by the media is shameful.\nHas the stranglehold of the Police State gotten so tight that it is considered treacherous to even mention the staggering rate at which police commit sex crimes against the citizenry?\nHas the Blue Line become an invisible monster that no longer represents justice, but conceals the very predators they swore to protect us from?\nOrder by Phone at 888-809-8385 or online at www.mitocopper.com\nGet our Free Ebook, \"Suppressed Health Secrets\"   with  Natural Cures THEY don't want you to know!\nAPeX - Far superior to colloidal silver!  Destroys Viruses, Bacteria, Pathogens with Oxygen plus Silver!\nSupreme Fulvic - Nature's most important supplement!

It’s just that being born again, Holy Spirits see, hear and feel, as to participate in whatever I, or Christ’s Anointed does. No doubt it’s why King David cried that God not see his sins, and why Apostle John heard God cry, He see and calculates men’s sins, and will judge them accordingly, even double. So because I Love Him, love you all, I don’t do anything purposely to offend Him, ah, Elohim, nor anyone else, doubtfully, I chance it, and what to my wondering eyes and heart do appear? Two women fiercely going at it, I could’ve kick myself into Kingdom come for chancing it, thankfully with Jesus’ Millennium already appearing, God’s Kingdom come is not that very far off.\n-To say the least, I was flabbergasted, first I turn my head and I stopped viewing, I didn’t even continue the series into The Flash, I couldn’t, wouldn’t, chance it, won’t, not again. Thank God it’s almost Christmas and time for warm Pureflix/Hallmark/BET Christmas movies, yeahhh! Just how serious is sexual abnormalities, ah, fornication? You want me to tell you that it, sexual sins lead to the genocide of everything that hath breath this planet in Noah’s day, Noah’s flood? That equally, God’s wrath changing not right into His at this very hour winepress, we’re talking a threat late 2017 of a Noah’s Cousin, so extinction level and earthbending, ending. That the one time scripture shows Jesus having wrath, frightfully it is regarding the whorish ways of the fornicator, the one sin that desecrates the very temple of God, the body. So much so, when Jesus said destroy this temple, sexual sin, see your Supreme Court, surely said, allow me. This is where Jesus’ wrath threatens to throw it’s advocators into a bed, a sick bed of immense agony and torment.

The internet may make information available more freely to a wider audience but it can also do the opposite to this. Reporting on how corrupt the police state is could have pretty serious consequences for everyone, so its probably in the national interest to keep it quiet and let it go on, thats the way officials think.\nNov 30, 2017, 12:42 pm\nCops are Criminal Gang Members . They stick together and stick up for one another , no matter WHAT !!! They wear gang colors (their uniforms) . They have territories (just like other criminal gangs) and they rule by fear and intimidation , beatings , rapes and murders (just like any and every other criminals gang out there) !!! And we are somehow supposed to actually Respect these FOOLS ???!!! I DON’T think so !!! At least some people are finally waking up to the reality of WHAT the police actually ARE now !!! “Serve and Protect” actually means to serve their OWN interests and protect their OWN asses and assests !!! Need a ” Cop ” ??? Call a DOUGHNUT SHOP ,that’s ALL they are ANY good for PERIOD !!!\nDec 2, 2017, 12:50 pm\nIt’s quite obvious why…because officer John Schmoe of Nowhere Nebraska is not a well known figure, therefore not newsworthy.\nDec 3, 2017, 12:29 am\npaulskye\nThe cops in Pinellas county florida and st.petersburg need to be investigated.
