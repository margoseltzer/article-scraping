        "text": "By N. Morgan\nTotal:\nRevolutionary New Study Again Confirms Natural Remedies Superior to Big Pharma Solutions: Magic Mushrooms Cure Depression (Videos)\nMonday, January 15, 2018 6:33\n \nA revealing new study once again has confirmed that a natural approach to be far superior to big pharma solutions—this time involving psilocybin, the active compound in magic mushrooms.\nThe study, published in the scientific journal Neuropharmacology, found that clinically depressed people had increased neural responses to fearful faces one day after a psilocybin-assisted therapy session, which positively predicted positive clinical outcomes.\n“Psilocybin-assisted therapy might mitigate depression by increasing emotional connection,” neuroscientist and study author Leor Roseman, a PhD student at Imperial College London, explained to PsyPost.\nThis is almost the exact opposite of how standard anti-depressants operate, as SSRI’s typically work by creating an “emotional blunting.”\nThis is unlike SSRI antidepressants which are criticized for creating in many people a general emotional blunting,” noted Roseman.\n“I believe that psychedelics hold a potential to cure deep psychological wounds, and I believe that by investigating their neuropsychopharmacological mechanism, we can learn to understand this potential,” explained Roseman.\nThe study examined 20 individuals diagnosed with moderate-to-severe treatment-resistant depression, in an effort to investigate how psilocybin would affect brain activity and chronic depressive symptoms.\nAccording to a report by Science Alert :\nPsilocybin, the active compound in magic mushrooms, has long been known to deliver therapeutic effects to people with depression, and researchers think this is because the drug helps to revive emotional responsiveness in the brain.\nWhat’s so remarkable is this kind of mechanism is actually the opposite effect of a major class of antidepressants used to treat the condition, called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\nSome of the same researchers, in a previous study, revealed that psilocybin seems to ‘reset’ brain circuits in depressed people. In that study, patients reported the benefits of psilocybin lasted up to five weeks after ending the treatment.\nIn the most recent study, researchers set out to determine the impact of psilocybin on the amygdala—a primitive part of the brain that helps process emotional reactions—as well as the compound’s effects on depression.\nThe study’s participants underwent MRI brain scans prior to taking the drug.\nThe participants were then involved in two individual sessions, one week apart, in which they took doses of psilocybin prior to undergoing another fMRI the morning after consuming the second dose.\nScience Alert went on to report:\nDuring the fMRI scans, the group were shown images of faces with either fearful, happy, or neutral expressions, and the researchers wanted to investigate what effect these faces had on the participants’ amygdala after taking psilocybin.\nAfter the experiment, the majority of patients reported that the psilocybin had eased their depressive symptoms, with almost half the group still seeing benefits from the treatment five weeks later – in line with the kinds of benefits, other depression studies using the drug have shown.\nMore intriguingly, the fMRI scans showed the drug heightened activity in the right amygdala, with increased responses to both fearful and happy faces – and the increases to fearful faces were predictive of clinical improvements in depressive symptoms one week after the experiment.\n“The major caveats are a lack of control group, a lack of SSRI group, and that the time point of investigation is only one day after the psilocybin session and not more than that. All of these caveats will be addressed in our next trial,” Roseman told PsyPost.\nRevealing a major problem with the current pharmaceutical treatments model for depression, which attempts to negate emotional receptivity using SSRIs—the alleviation of depression using psilocybin is achieved by increasing emotional receptivity.\n“It is important to emphasize that psilocybin-assisted therapy is a model in which the patient is undergoing a deep psychological process in one or few psychedelic sessions, in which he might have an intense cathartic experience, or peak experience,” Roseman explained.\nA dose of psilocybin was administered in a controlled setting while professionals are on hand to provide the patients with psychological support. Typically, the patients receive counselling before and after each session, in an effort to assist them in preparing for, and integrating, their psychedelic experience.\n“This is unlike antidepressants which are given as chronic pharmacological intervention with less psychological insights,” Roseman noted.\nIt is important to note that the study clearly shows that increased emotional receptivity being enhanced alleviates depression—almost the exact opposite of how SSRI antidepressants operate.\nFor patients who suffer from depression, but have had negative side effects from the mainstream anti-depressants, mushrooms could hold the key to a happier and mentally well balanced life. \nOrder by Phone at 888-809-8385 or online at www.mitocopper.com\nGet our Free Ebook, \"Suppressed Health Secrets\"   with  Natural Cures THEY don't want you to know!\nAPeX - Far superior to colloidal silver!  Destroys Viruses, Bacteria, Pathogens with Oxygen plus Silver!\nSupreme Fulvic - Nature's most important supplement!

This plant has been labeled as a bad thing to consume and that only drug users consume it. With that being said we were also told that Marijuana makes black men rape white women. The demonization campaign against Kratom is in full swing because so many people across the world are getting off of prescription drugs. Anti-depressants, pain medications, ant-anxiety pills and so much more are all being thrown in the garbage because people are finding a natural cure. This plant has actually been banned in several states now which should give you a clue that it is no joke. I highly recommend anyone suffering from addiction and dependence to prescription drugs to try this plant which you can order online. You can go to Reddit and then look on the Kratom forum for different vendors who are reputable in the United States to order from.\nI wish I could explain to the non believers are uninformed on this plant how much it could potentially save their life. So many people are used to having to revolve their life schedule around doctor appointments and medication availability schedules when there is a legal (In most states) alternative that can give them their life back. If you have any of these dependencies than please just do a search for Mitrogyna Speciosa (Kratom) and give it a try. I promise you that it can give you your life back.\nI took pain medicine for 16 years daily for the most part and my life revolved around my ability to get my medicine. My family suffered because without the medicine I was unable to function due to pain and anxiety. 16+ years. I quit cold turkey and have yet to have an urge come back to get medicine again. That was over 14 months ago and I don’t even need medicine anymore. I actually got a prescription for pain meds from a dentist recently and they just sit in the medicine cabinet collecting dust when before they would have been gobbled up in 1-2 days.  I only go in to these personal details because I hope these words help save someone else’s life like it has mine. If you are dependent, don’t be ashamed anymore and give this a try. Get your life back out of the hands of big pharma.\nJan 15, 2018, 9:17 pm\nAnonymous\nCURE= GABA- gamma amino butyric acid -brain and neuro amino acid-deficient in persons suffering depression…\nCAN GET FROM NUTRABIO.COM with no fillers.\nalso B vitamins especially B1 and B12 must be methykcobalamin\nNutrigold has mens and women’s multi’s all organic, no soy, no go’s, no corn, no crap….\nalso lay off the caffeine inflammatories…\nJan 16, 2018, 5:55 pm\nI seen people chirping like a song bird after a doctor gives them a vaccine so they can go to school or adult coloring books are given to them after a flu shot and play doe\nJan 17, 2018, 4:59 pm\nDidianna\nBest medicine for depression is to start to help others.
