        "text": "Tuesday, January 23, 2018 18:27\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nPedophilia is a longstanding suppressed issue by the Vatican.\nWhen criminal and civil cases challenged its negligence in dealing with this issue, judicial decisions usually don’t hold the Vatican, dioceses or pedophile priests accountable.\nThe Catholic hierarchy suppresses publication of information relating to priest offenders. Instead of holding them accountable, most often they’re transferred to other dioceses.\nAn earlier John Jay College of Criminal Justice (JJCCJ) report discovered under-age 18 molestation by priests occurs in over 95% of dioceses and about 60% of religious communities in America.\nGiven reluctance of victims to come forward, it’s virtually certain that instances of abuse are more widespread than from what’s publicly known.\nPedophilia is a global issue, especially in nations and communities with large Catholic populations, coverup commonplace, ignoring the harm predatory priests inflict on young children, mostly boys.\nIn America alone, pedophilia scandals occurred in numerous dioceses nationwide, at times resulting in large payouts to victims, buying their silence.\nPope Francis and his predecessors are guilty of coverup. Last May, Francis absolved 2,000 pedophile priests.\nClaiming the church is “on the right path” addressing the issue was code language for coverup and refusal to hold culpable priests accountable.\nAny found guilty of raping young children should be defrocked, prosecuted and imprisoned. Failure to hold them accountable shows complicity with their high crimes.\nThe Vatican has a long dark history of coverup on this issue. Last June Pope Francis scrapped a proposed tribunal to prosecute bishops responsible for suppressing the crimes of pedophile priests.\nHe issued a weak-kneed statement, saying bishops “must undertake a particular diligence in protecting those who are the weakest among their flock” – avoiding the issue instead of acting responsibly.\nIn Chile days earlier, he criticized victims of pedophile priest Fernando Karadima. Bishop Juan Barros was accused of suppressing his crimes.\nFrancis is part of the coverup, saying “(t)he day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, I’ll speak. There is not one shred of proof against him. It’s all calumny Is that clear?”\nActivists James Hamilton, Juan Carlos Cruz and Jose Andres Murillo together tweeted: “This is serious and we cannot accept it. What he has done today is offensive and painful, and it also reveals an unknown face of the pontiff.”\nSeparately Cruz tweeted: Francis’ defense of Barros means his “forgiveness remains empty.”\n“As if I could have taken a selfie or photo while Karadima abused me and others with Juan Barros standing next to him watching it all.”\n“These people are truly crazy, and the pontiff talks about atonement to the victims. Nothing has changed.”\nInstead of being charged with rape, Karadima was sentenced to a life of reflection and penance. For years, the Vatican ignored his crimes. Barros was part of the coverup.\nIn Peru after days in Chile, the issue of clerical pedophile abuse wasn’t raised.\nBefore becoming archbishop of Buenos Aires, then a cardinal, Jorge Mario Bergoglio (Pope Francis) supported the brutal military dictatorship (March 1976 – December 1983) and dirty war it raged against political and social justice.\nThousands were disappeared (los desaparecidos), held in detention centers, tortured and killed. Anyone expressing dissent or considered an ideological or political threat was vulnerable.\nFrancis’ high-minded rhetoric belies papal tradition, supporting wealth and power interests, paying lip service alone to popular needs and welfare.\nA Vatican press statement expressed opposition to Venezuela’s democratically elected National Constituent Assembly last year, saying:\n“The Holy See asks that all political actors, and in particular the government, guarantee full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as for the existing Constitution; avoid or suspend ongoing initiatives such as the new Constituent which, instead of favoring reconciliation and peace, foments a climate of tension and confrontation and puts the future at stake” – code language for opposition to Bolivarian social democracy.\nInstead of supporting social justice, Francis and the Catholic hierarchy oppose it, pretending otherwise.\nInstead of holding pedophile priests accountable for their crimes, the Holy See sweeps them under the rug.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
