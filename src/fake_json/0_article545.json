Of course, these text messages aren’t really lost, and President Donald Trump knows that they are the key to destroy Mueller’s investigation. Luckily, the president just slammed them with what he found in the Oval Office.\nThe FBI “failed to preserve” five months worth of text messages exchanged between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, the two FBI employees who made pro-Clinton and anti-Trump comments while working on the Clinton email and the Russia collusion investigations.\n“The Department wants to bring to your attention that the FBI’s technical system for retaining text messages sent and received on FBI mobile devices failed to preserve text messages for Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page,” Stephen Boyd, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs at the Justice Department, wrote to Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, reports  Daily Caller .\nWell isn’t that convenient? The FBI “failed to preserve” five months of text messages between Trump-hating FBI agent Peter Strzok and his mistress Lisa Page, blaming a “technical glitch.” One of the text message exchanges lost between these traitors Stzrok and Page points to the Loretta Lynch-Bill Clinton meeting on the tarmac.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
