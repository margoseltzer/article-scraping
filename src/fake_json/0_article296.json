        "text": "By Occidental Dissent\nTuesday, January 23, 2018 16:50\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nI said this was going to happen yesterday.\nYou won’t see this elsewhere because it is “blackpilling.” Pay your respects in the comments to shabbos goy Mike Pence. Meet the new conservatism. Same as the old conservatism.\nNote: We don’t give a shit about the Alt-Right’s pills here at OD. We only care about the truth. The facts don’t give a damn about your precious feelings.\nWATCH: Vice President Pence visits the Western Wall as part of his visit to the Middle East https://t.co/ayhfhjy0Pc pic.twitter.com/mB0WNyU4PC\n#VPinIsrael Photos of the Day: Important discussions in Israel w/ @PresidentRuvi on our Nation’s shared values & interests, including trade, standing together against Iran, & our Embassy’s move to Jerusalem, prayed at the Western Wall, & visited U.S Embassy staff & their families pic.twitter.com/sGnTBZ1n8o\nKaren & I joined Prime Minister @Netanyahu to commemorate the innocent lives lost & lay a wreath at Yad Vashem earlier today. We mourn the 6 million Jewish victims of the Holocaust & we draw inspiration from the faith & resilience of the Jewish people. Never again. #VPinIsrael pic.twitter.com/cqdnaBjapu\nIt was a great honor to host @VP Mike Pence in Israel. He gave exceptional expression to the powerful relationship between Israel and the United States, and we’ll always remember his magnificent speech in the Knesset. pic.twitter.com/nEjMpFdN3K\nA privilege to pray at the Western Wall. This is our 4th trip to the Holy Land, but Karen & I never fail to leave without a sense our faith has been renewed – our faith in God, but also our faith in the people of Israel & their commitment to freedom, security & peace. #VPinIsrael pic.twitter.com/DbujemM0fO\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
