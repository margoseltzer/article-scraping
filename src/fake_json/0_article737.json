        "text": "By Brother Ralphie\nMonday, January 22, 2018 9:18\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nI said in yesterday’s post that monks were probably responsible for the early training of Jesus until He was ready to go out into the world and do what He needed to do.  I said too that it was the three wise men who brought to Jesus what He would need to pay for His living expenses while under the tutelage of the monks.  But what I didn’t really make clear is exactly who these monks might have been.  There were a lot of religions in the area, but I tend to think that Buddhism probably had the strongest foothold in most of the known world at that time.  And Buddhism then, would have stressed the importance of EVERY living thing to be left alone to live.  Human Life was and still is most important to Buddhism.  This really shouldn’t be a shock to most anyone that Judaism at that time as practiced in the Temple revered the Law of Moses.  This teaching would have been contrary to most other religious thinking at the time since Judaism believed in punishment for sins, particularly if a sin demanded death.  This would have been according to the teachings of Judaism.  It was the Pharisees in Judaism then, that would have carried out the death sentences. \nJesus obviously knew the Old Testament, which would have been the ONLY Scriptures at that time.  And He was probably versed well enough in the Laws of Moses to have been a Scribe and Rabbi in the Temple.  In fact, He is referred to as Rabbi throughout the Gospels.  Now, I am not trying to defend Buddhism, but these monks were probably from the Essenes, which lived separately from among the rest of society at that time.  We don’t know much about them except that they did exist.  And I keep referring to them as “monks” because evidently whoever was responsible for His training would have lived like monks and indeed did all they could to keep His life a secret until He was ready to venture out into the world.  At that time, Jesus had all the time in the world to learn what He needed to learn, because He wouldn’t have had all the distractions we have today.  He more than likely immersed Himself in all kinds of religious thought of that day. \nSo, I am just saying that with His emphasis on the importance of Human Life, and allowing every person to live regardless, He would have rejected the death penalty as imposed by the Pharisees.  This would have been against all He was taught about the importance of EVERY Human Life. \nI say this, not to defend Buddhism or be critical of Judaism, but to simply state that at that time, this was the culture in which He was raised.  He knew all about the ways of religion in general.  He understood all religious thinking.  And the fact is, He couldn’t accept death for ANY reason.  He raised Lazarus from the dead, for example, not because He missed him, but because the people were almost accusing Him of murder by not being present when he died.  He cried for the unbelief of those who were saddened by his death.  Jesus was left with no other choice than to bring Lazarus back from the dead.  But somehow and somewhere, Jesus learned He had this power over death.  Teachings of the resurrection were very common at this time.  Jesus had no reason to cry over the death of Lazarus, so His sadness could only be caused by the unbelief of the people who were sad Lazarus died. \nThis is only one example of the importance of life and living to Jesus.  This understanding would have been compatible with most religions of the day.  But there were those religions that taught that there could be the punishment of death for certain sins.  Judaism was one of those religions.  And as I have said, it had to be monks who kept the life of Jesus a secret until His baptism.  And really, in my estimation, they did a pretty good job, mostly because they had no other choice.  Peace.  I am Brother Ralphie writing for my Angels from The Angels of Life Institute.  Brother Ralphie works from his study for the promotion of Peaceful living and inner Peace with God.

WE TAKE WHAT WE CREATE!\nJan 22, 2018, 9:29 am\nWow! That’s about as much garbage as the article itself! SMH\n* Only belief in Joshua the Messiah (Heb. Yehoshu’a HaMashiach/Gr. ‘Iesous Christos) is required; the Holy Spirit was sent to be our Helper and Teacher.\n* Gehenna and Belial are REAL!\n* Less than 1% of the Bible is false — including additions and subtractions. Key words in study Bibles: “not found in early mss” (=manuscripts). Esther makes NO MENTION of God and was not found among the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS). 1 Enoch and Jubilees were the third and sixth most frequent manuscripts discovered among the DSS; see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls#Biblical_books_found . Jude quotes 1 Enoch. Jasher was also excluded yet mentioned in the OT among others.\n* Heaven is NOT the domain of humans — only the Elohim! True believers will tabernacle with Christ in New Jerusalem on the New Earth.\n* Lucifer is a manufactured name by the RCC; his name is Belial.\n* There will be a “gathering of the elect” (=chosen ones) AFTER the Tribulation.\n* “Jesus” is the transliteration from the Latin — NOT the translation! His Name is Yehoshu’a, ‘Iesous, or Joshua, and He was certainly conceived of the Holy Spirit on the Feast of New Oil in 5 CE and born on the Feast of Weeks in 6 CE during the census of Quirinius ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_of_Quirinius ) when Herod Archelaus ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_Archelaus ) was “King of the Jews” (ruler of Judea). Herod the Great died a decade before. The Herods were Edomites (descendants of Esau).\n* Yahoah (true pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton) was the firstborn of Creation; everything was created through and for Him, and through Him ALL things hold together! He was born incarnate as Yehoshu’a (=Yahoah saves). According to Reuben Alcalay, a famous Hebrew lexicographer, Yehoshu’a is closely related to “Let there be…” In Koine Greek, His Name is ‘Iaw (iota-alpha-omega); He is truly the beginning and end…\nJan 22, 2018, 9:40 am\nRalphie, Titus Flavius Josephus (né Yosef ben Matityahu) — a Jewish historian, Roman citizen, and self-described Pharisee — coined the derogatory term “Essenes” (=pious ones) for this “sect.” He even had a spurious claim of living among those in Qumran before deciding to practice Pharisaism; however, his timeline does not mesh up (i.e., he lied on his résumé). The Dead Sea Scrolls mention “the way” (Heb. HaDerech) repeatedly in significant manuscripts.  Now, go read Acts with understanding…\nActs 24:14 But this I admit to you, that according to [T]he Way which they call a sect I do serve the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets; 15 having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves, that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. (NASB)\nJan 22, 2018, 9:47 am\nYochanan (John) and his disciples were based in the desert wilderness of Qumran — NOT Yehoshu’a (Joshua).  Recall that Yochanan was a first-born, Levite male with a kohen father ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohen ).\nLuke 1:80 And the child continued to grow and to become strong in spirit, and he lived in the deserts until the day of his public appearance to Israel. (NASB)\nHe was the voice crying out in the (Judean desert) wilderness.\nHe oversaw a tevilah ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual_washing_in_Judaism#Conversion_to_Judaism ) in a miqveh ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikveh ).  The Jordan River qualified as a miqveh as its “living waters” originated with a natural spring — the Banias at the foot of Mount Hermon ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_River#Tributaries ).  These believers were converting to The Way in droves!\nNothing was new under the sun… Gr. baptizò simply means (full-body) immersion in water; see http://biblehub.com/greek/907.htm .\nJan 22, 2018, 10:10 am\nWhat occurred on the road to Damascus where Sha’ul was going to persecute the Congregation of men and women belonging to the “sect” called The Way under direct orders from the Great Sanhedrin?\nActs 9:1 Now Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest, 2 and asked for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to THE WAY [emphasis mine], both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. 3 As he was traveling, it happened that he was approaching Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; 4 and he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?” 5 And he said, “Who are You, Lord?” And He said, “I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, 6 but get up and enter the city, and it will be told you what you must do.” 7 The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. 8 Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; and leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus. 9 And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank. (NASB)\nActs 22:1 “Brethren and fathers, hear my defense which I now offer to you.” 2 And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew dialect, they became even more quiet; and he said, 3 “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated under Gamaliel, strictly according to the law of our fathers, being zealous for God just as you all are today. 4 I persecuted this WAY [emphasis mine] to the death, binding and putting both men and women into prisons, 5 as also the high priest and all the Council of the elders can testify. From them I also received letters to the brethren, and started off for Damascus in order to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished. 6 “But it happened that as I was on my way, approaching Damascus about noontime, a very bright light suddenly flashed from heaven all around me, 7 and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?’ 8 And I answered, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And He said to me, ‘I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.’ 9 And those who were with me saw the light, to be sure, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me. 10 And I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, ‘Get up and go on into Damascus, and there you will be told of all that has been appointed for you to do.’ 11 But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus. (NASB)\nAnd, before Governor Felix, Paulos said:\nActs 24:14 But this I admit to you, that according to THE WAY [emphasis mine] which they call a sect I do serve the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets; 15 having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves, that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. 16 In view of this, I also do my best to maintain always a blameless conscience both before God and before men. (NASB)\nThat provides deeper meaning when Joshua said to Thomas et al.:\nJohn 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am THE WAY [emphasis mine], and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me. (NASB)\nNote: “Jesus” is the transliteration of the Latin ’Iesvs — NOT the translation.  His Name was preserved in Koine Greek as ‘Iesous; see http://biblehub.com/greek/2424.htm .  Most Christians today do not know the Messiah’s Name because of the unholy, mother goddess, Catholic church; that false tradition bled over into Protestantism after the Reformation.\nJan 22, 2018, 10:51 am\nQumran was established nearly two centuries before Joshua’s birth on the Feast of Weeks during the census of Quirinius in 6 CE ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_of_Quirinius ).  The last vestige of it was discovered at Masada ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masada ); see https://members.bib-arch.org/biblical-archaeology-review/38/6/4 .\nThe Way certainly saw their Latter Days in 74 CE…\nOne last thing… How are the 144,000 described in Revelation?  Celibate, Israelite males!\nRevelation 7:4 And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel: 5 from the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand, 6 from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, from the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand, from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand, 7 from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand, from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand, 8 from the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand, from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, from the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were sealed. (NASB)\nRevelation 14:1 Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads. 2 And I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the voice which I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps. 3 And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth. 4 These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they have kept themselves chaste. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb. 5 And no lie was found in their mouth; they are blameless. (NASB)\nWhere the Pharisees and Sadducees celibate?  Certainly NOT!  But, those at Qumran — including John — were.  See what Joshua thought of the Sadducees in Matthew 22:23-33 and the Pharisees in Matthew 22:34-23:39.\nShema Yisrael!\nCLICK HERE TO UPLOAD NEWS!\n\"Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the  Lord of hosts.\"  Zechariah 4:6\nRead it..\nSubmit\nToday's Top Stories\nFeatured\nPortions copyright © 2019 NSearch Technology, Inc., All Rights Reserved.\nBefore It's News® is a registered Service Mark of NSearch Technology,     Inc..\nLooks like you’re using an ad-blocker.\nThis site is supported by ads.
