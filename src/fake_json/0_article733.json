        "text": "Due Diligence\nDue Diligence:Combine Psalm 29:2 Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His Name; worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness. With Hebrews 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. I give the LORD His due diligence, would you join me? Lets disclose the deceptions that the enemy of our souls has disseminated.  I am a twice-born Christian awakened to the fast-paced fulfillment of Biblical prophecy.  Be blessed my friends, may you find the comfort and safety of salvation through Jesus Christ the True, ETERNALLY living and ETERNALLY VICTORIOUS Messiah.\nValid 10 years unless revoked\nFirst amendment rights: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\nPortions copyright © 2019 NSearch Technology, Inc., All Rights Reserved.\nBefore It's News® is a registered Service Mark of NSearch Technology,     Inc..\nLooks like you’re using an ad-blocker.\nThis site is supported by ads.
