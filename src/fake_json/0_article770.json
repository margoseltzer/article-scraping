        "text": "Thursday, January 18, 2018 18:22\n \nI have had a few interesting conversations with people from different walks of life about the antichrist. I really like to hear what people perceive and believe about the end times. Since I am a lover of eschatology, I am always ready for a good discussion, always praying for an opportunity to share the gospel of Christ!\nIs the antichrist a man or a computer? This is actually a great question. Let’s look at the scriptures to see what God says.\n2 Thessalonians 2:1-4 “Now, we request you, brethren, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, that you not be quickly shaken from your composure or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. Let no one in any way deceive you, for it will not come unless the apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called God or object of worship so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, displaying himself as being God.”\nThe scripture here refers to the antichrist as a man, a lawless one at that, and the son of destruction. He will destroy many lives during his reign. He also exalts himself above all so- called gods and our God, and takes a seat in the third Jewish temple to be worshipped.\nSounds like a human to me. Let’s look further!\nThe book of Daniel in chapter 8 also speaks of this man, the antichrist. In Daniel’s vision, given to him by God of the latter days, it says starting in verse 23:\n“In the latter period of their rule, when the transgressors have run their course, a king will arise, insolent and skilled in intrigue. His power will be mighty, but not by his own power, and he will destroy to an extraordinary degree and prosper and perform his will. He will destroy mighty men and the holy people. Through his shrewdness he will cause deceit to succeed by influence. He will magnify himself in his heart. He will destroy many while they are at ease. He will even oppose the Prince of Princes, but he will be broken without human agency” (Daniel 8:23-25).\nLet’s recap these human attributes:\n1) He is living in the end times.\n2) He will be a king or leader of a country; scripture hints he will rise to power suddenly.\n3) Insolent: this means rude, disrespectful, contemptuous.\n4) Skilled in intrigue, he will wow people (and have many likes on Facebook). But he will have a dark, sinister side that will be fleshed out. He is a liar.\n5) He will be mighty with the power of Satan and all those who align themselves with him.\n6) He will destroy and kill all who oppose him – the tribulation saints and Jews who refuse to take his mark on their hand and forehead.\n7) He will magnify himself in his heart. History repeats itself. Satan did this and look what happened.\n8) He will destroy many while they are at ease. He confirms a peace covenant with Israel and then breaks it. He does it for his own purpose and plan. He does not know peace, only destruction.\n9) He comes against the Prince of Princes, the Lord Jesus Christ. He loses, of course! Please read Revelation for this overwhelming victory of the Lamb!\n10) Broken without human agency. This means he did not die by the hands of another person. This could mean sickness or an accident. In this case, he is slain by Jesus. Read the details in Revelation!\nDaniel was exhausted and sick for days after this vision!\nThis does not sound like a robot or a computer image. This is a flesh and blood human being, a man, a very bad man possessed by Satan and allowed by God, during a specific point in time, to do these things. The Bible speaks of this; Jesus speaks of this to his disciples in the gospels in Matthew 24.\nThe phrase “abomination of desolation” is giving the reader of this passage a clue to who this person is! He emphasizes for the reader to have understanding. He wants the reader to read the book of Daniel so you know the context of what he is saying. The antichrist is the abomination of desolation. They are one and the same.\nThis person is a real person; and when he is seen in the holy place, the third temple, the Jewish remnant must flee from his presence—a don’t look back, grab the babies, we are out of here now, pray there is no snow on the mountains of Israel as you flee to them, kind-of-flee!\nI see in the above scripture of 2 Thessalonians that we may have a glimpse of this man before the rapture. I have definitely seen the apostasy spoken of, characteristic of the last days, here and now. I know we are close.\nBut I know my Jesus, and I can’t wait to hear the trumpet to come on up! My husband and children, grandchildren with me!!\nSally Law\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!

Son was formed when man and woman had sexual intercourse . In the book of Ezekiel , GOD calls him son of man in many chapters of the book of Ezekiel . Meaning one who is born of a mans sperm seed or his dads seed . There are differences in beings on planet earth .  Jesus called the Roman people who was set up as Levites pretending  to be Preist of GOD  , but was of Esau’s descent , serpents and of your father the devil . The negative blood lines by science is as they say , reptilians . They say they are aliens when compairing them to humans . The Vatican , the queen of England , Obama , Hillary , Billy boy , Bush family , Rothschilds , Hitler , Angela Merkel ( Hitlers daughter from his sperm inseminated into his wife’s sister ) Are all negative blood reptilians . Like Jesus stated they are the seed of the devil . This is why Jesus makes plain the seed of man or son of man or daughter of man . They grow up to be adult men and women . The seed of the devil will be separated at the judgement . As picture action brings out the sheep of GOD will be separated from the goats of lucifer . What emblem represents lucifer That satanist use ? The Goat !\nJan 18, 2018, 11:50 pm\nJango\nSorry Bro, but the man of lawlessness is NOT the antichrist in 2 Thes 2 .  He is the little horn from Daniel 9, one of the antichrist’s generals.  The antichrist will be an eternal being like the devil and his angels.  The proof of this is that in Rev 19 the antichrist is cast into the lake of fire for eternity where as in 2 Thes 2:9, Jesus DESTROYS the man of lawlessness…….so it’s not the same guy.   Most Christians make this crucial mistake.   Same as those that think the first horesman is also the antichrist…..he’s not.    You can find the full write up along with scriptures to back it up at http://www.itshisstory.com for fuller details.\nJan 18, 2018, 9:03 pm\nEverette\nSorry bro go back and read that scripture again in KJV . It plainly tells you that this is the one who exalts himself above all that is call God and seats himself in the temple as God , just like lucifer did and was cast out of Heaven . Then it states now you know what with holdeth him that he might be reveled in his time . Only He who now letteth will let , until he be taken out of the way . And then shall that wicked be reveled ! Whom the Lord shall consume with the Spirit of His mouth ? The Antichrist is the false prophet ( pope ) that shall introduce lucifer to the world . The anti Christ is of the descendants of Esau , vatican natzi Edomites dukes   . Christ is an anointed man of GOD . Anti is the opposite of Christ being anointed by lucifer .  The Beast  is lucifer possibly using a person or body he chooses to show himself as . Maybe he will look like a beast because in Revelation 12 we are told he is called the devil , the serpent and the dragon . In other words a reptilian like his sons of Esau . The only man GOD states HE hates in Malachi 1:1-4 . And in other books we are told that they will be wiped out totally . In the old Tesament we are also told that lucifer will be cast to the sides of the pit and will be burnt to ashes . No chance of him returning to mess up things again .\nJan 18, 2018, 11:30 pm\nJango\nActually this stumped me for awhile because it didn’t fit until I looked at how they die.  The antichrist does not, but the man of lawlessness does.  Sorry Bro, but they are NOT the same guy.\nJan 19, 2018, 6:40 pm\nEverette\nSally you have picked a topic that almost all Bible scholars argue over ! A good topic because as tge end nears the book of Daniel will u fold to revel its self . Remember GOD told Daniel to seal it up until many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased . Then shall the book of Daniel be reveled . Like you I believe we are very close . Signs and wonders all over th place . We are told when we see these signs , lift up you head for your redemption draws nigh . Looking at this verse I see as the prophecies begin unfolding one after another then get ready redemption is near ready to take you out ! Now in KJV 2Thessalonians 2:4-10 we find when this wicked one will be reveled . It is after this person is removed , then the wicked one shall be reveled . Who is this person ? Here comes something you probably have never heard before . How can Jesus be the Prince of Princes and be the King of Kings at tge same time  ? Many will say He is both . True He  can be both but He is not both ! In Ezekiel chapters 44 and 46 we are told about this Prince who enters the eastern gate and offers sacrifaces the LORD OF HOSTS ( the Projection of the ANCIENT OF DAYS – GOD YHVH )  . No man can look upon GOD’s face and live . Moses only got to see GOD’s back . But then we find that he took 70 elders up to meet GOD . Books of Isaiah , Ezekiel and Jeremiah we find that there is GOD YHVH , THE LORD OF HOSTS and the son of man . In the book of Job GOD says HE hides HIMSELF in thick dark clouds . And that only a select few Angels are allowed to be in HIS presence . The others are given a projection of GOD HIMSELF as THE LORD OF HOSTS which seems as the book of Enoch stated the angels are on different levels . Now the book of John tells us that Jesus was GOD become flesh . We are also told that Jesus was virgin born and as the book of Genesis stated the seed of woman . Did Jesus have an earthly father ? No ! Ok then how can He be called the son of man ? In the book of Ezekiel GOD calls Ezekiel son of man many times in his book . Ok what does  that mean , he is a being born by the sperm seed of man .  Every human born by mans injection into the woman’s womb is a son of man or daughter of man ! I’ve got to inject this in order for you to see the real picture . The vatican in 325 AD took the books or scrolls and decided which ones were to be put together to be called the Bible . Get ready ! Here it comes  ! They are descendants of Esau the brother of Jacob . In Malachi 1:1-4 GOD states HE hates them . Their  linage HE promises to totally destroy .  The Bible has books that contradict each other which the vatican put together for their benefit  . Example , Matthew and Luke contradict each other on Jesus linage . Some say one is Mary’s linage , not so ! It plainly tells us that Joseph is Jesus father in both of them . But from King David down to Jesus both contradict each other . One uses Nathan’s ( King David’s son ) linage , the other uses Solomon’s ( King David’s son )  linage . Then all the names to Joseph contradict each other . So which one is right , neither one ! Joseph is not Jesus father !!! So being virgin born without mans sperm , Mary comes into play . She is not of the tribe of Judea . Elisabeth was her couin who was married to the High Preist . Elisabeth by GOD’s law must also be a Levite . Mary then being her cousin was a Levite as was Jesus our High Preist of the Levitical Tribe . Huston we have problems here ! To fulfill prophecies the son of man Jesus spoke about must be of King David’s sperm seed . Jesus said and you shall see the sign of the son of man coming in the clouds with glory and great power  . Matthew 24:30-31 Jesus says and He shall send His angels to gather His elect . In all the other verses Jesus uses I , Me and Mine speaking of Himself . Who is He speaking of ? Jesus is not a son of man , He is a son of woman . So how does this son of man get angels to gather the elect ? The book of Daniel states He was called up before the ANCIENT OF DAYS and was given Power , Glory and a Kingdom . And He was sent back to earth . In the old testament we are told many times this son of man or sometimes called son of David will lead the elect in the wilderness near mount Zion and will feed them , protect them and teach them . When the earth goes thru many perils one is the time of darkness . The Bible states that on tgem will be light continuely . Let’s back up here ! The son of man comes in the clouds to gather the elect . Who are the elect ? In Revelation 3:7-10 we are told that the church of Philadelphia will be protected when everyone else is going thru the tribulation period ( all the other churches that played patti cake with GOD go thru the tribulation ) . They must prove their love for GOD ! So Matthew 24:29-31 is the church elect of Philadelphia ( church of Love and paientce and keeping of GOD’s word ) . Wait ? That’s it ? The elect are the only ones removed ? There seems to be times between the leaving of the elect and the resserrection of the dead that possibly some are removed that have proven their Love for GOD . Here comes the biggest one yet . I will tell you when the resserrection will take place , The scriptures tell us plainly . Revelation 20:5-6 tells you exactually when the ressurrection of the first rising of the dead takes place , just before the 1000 year reign of Christ . Now let’s throw in more sticks into the fire . Christ in Hebrew is an anointed man called by GOD to do a certin job and given HIS anointing to do this job . Jesus was a totally different being , being He was the son of woman . Was He a man ? He looked like a man , acted like a man but as Ron Wyatt who found the Ark of the Covenant under Jesus cross and Jesus blood that leaked down the crack which was caused by the earthquake and dropping on to the mercy seat , Jesus chromosomes only had 23 and not 46 like the rest of the human race . 23 come from the woman and 23 come from the man .  When tested Jesus chromosomes were only of the woman . Was He a man ? John chapter 1 states HE GOD became flesh so that mankind could handle him and touch him . Here is something to ponder . Ezekiel chapters 44 and 46 tells us that the Prince will have children , bring back GOD’s  Sabbath ( Saturday ) worship and offer sacrifaces . Is this something to remind Him of His frailty as He wields GOD ‘s power to use as He wishes ?  GOD stated in the old testament the Sabbath is forever . In the old testament we are told that the son of man will rule with a rod of iron here on earth . We are not going to Heaven ! Heaven is coming to us as Revelation21 and 22 states . Durning the 1000 year reign of King David’s descendnt , He will bring all nations back into subjection to GOD ! They must go to Jerusalem once a year to worship the LORD OF HOSTS ( GOD’s projection of HIMSELF ) . After everything is finished then GOD YHVH will bring Heaven from As the book of Job states from the constellation Orion where GOD resides in the north sky to earth to dwell with the righteous forever on planet earth . HE will be their KING ( YESHUA ) . And the son of David will be the Prince . In Heaven there is no marrying and giving in marriage where it is located now  . But on planet earth the scriptures tell us that we shall fill the universe with our seed . Of all the people ever born should they come to life  would not fill the universe . We are going to continue to have children . The Prince will have children . No floating in the clouds or off in some fantasy land . In the book of  Pslams we are told the earth was built to be forever . So the clean up  at the end of Revelation stating new Heaven and New earth , means a make over a redo . the story you have heard is from the vatican . To know which books belong to GOD do a search on Bible Code . Only certain books in the Bible contain this code of history naming names of people  and places and their accomplishments . An interesting search is ( Free Bible Code Search or http://www.biblecodewisdom.com ) . Type in your name and see how many places in the Bible your name appears . Then  like Jeopardy type answers instead of questions . Like – Sally nurse , Sally GOD’s child , Sally over comes devil ( or Satan ) . The small words like is , a , of are usally are not included . If you use these words they may tell you no answer found . The sky is the limit with your searches . But first look up ( discovery of Bible Code ) to get an understanding of how to use the Bible Code Search . It had 911 , Kennedy’s death and where he was shot from . It’s very hard to use it to predict the future . But after it has happened and you know the facts then you can type in the answers and see GOD who for knew had HIS prophets write their books in exact order not changing one letter or word . If changed it screws up the whole book and the code is null and void in that book – like Isaiah or Ezekiel   . What an AWSOME GOD we serve  ! With this code you can know which books GOD approves of and is HIS dictation to HIS prophets . The only gospel out of the four in the new Testament with the Bible code is the book of John . The others were written about or over 150 years after Jesus and was handed down traditions . John was the disciple Jesus loved and was the only disciple at the foot of the cross with Mary .\nJan 18, 2018, 10:40 pm\nFirmament Does Exist\nExcept He died on a pole or tree, the “cross” was intentional mistranslation from Rome when they replaced stauros with Crux…….tough to find the truth reading Jesuit translations that removed all the Hebrew names…..KJV,NIV,nasb are based on Catholic text. Is that why you call YHWH a “lord”? Because He can’t be “a lord”, a lord serves a King!\nJan 19, 2018, 6:20 am\ndakota\nFind the truth, or close to it, since it has been tampered with, in the Douay Reims bible.\nKing James version is NOT catholic, even though all catholics were urged to purchase that thing.  The only one that will get you close is the original Douay Reims bible.\nSorry, but that’s the truth….and I’m stick’n to it.\nJesus died on the CROSS.  It was handmade of wood from 7 different trees.  There was  a reason for each type of wood and it was God’s plan.  Perhaps it was so people couldn’t say it was a pole or a tree itself.  lol.  I believe you will find the 7 types of wood in the Douay Reims Bible.  I remember reading about it decades ago.\nOh, and YHWH is a sarcastic name for God, according to the Christian section of the Talmud.  Don’t say it.\nJan 19, 2018, 1:16 pm\nPsp\nI believe HE is a person however, if you calculate computer usin a=6, b=12, c=18 system….computer = 666. Computer will be used in the image of the beast in some way.\nJan 19, 2018, 6:28 am\ndakota\nI wouldn’t hold my breathe waiting for any trumpets.  There’s no rapture.\nYou’ve been having many glimpses of this man for the last 35 years. So you don’t have to wait for it. He is white. He is a Royal.  You’ve known him since he was born.  He was presented on tv to the entire world.  He will retain the physical attributes of the age of 33.  He will not age anymore.  His wife will age, but not him.\nHe is not great looking, but he is charming and has a lot of charisma at first.  Then he changes after he gets shot in the head.\nHe is already amongst world leaders and hosting his share of the ‘parties’. He is from Europe, but he has been on the continent of North America many times.  His mother wanted to take him and his brother to live in America, but that was prevented from happening.  He has a Castle in the clouds in Montana now though. It’s on the top of a big mountain.  There are 3 mountains in the mountain chain. If I had to guess which mountain, I would say the middle one.\nHe will rise to power suddenly when he kills his father (or has him killed).  You won’t know it was he who killed or had his father killed.  His father, heir to the throne, would have been king before him.  Can’t have that now. Can we?  This can happen any time now though.  There will be a family wedding in late spring so this will be after that.\nWe may not have a facebook by the time he comes to ‘visible’ power as the antichrist himself, nor have computers. HOWEVER…………you will see him become King.  He has 2 children at this moment and one due this spring, I believe.  Super babies created in a lab dish.  According to prophecy, it will be another girl.\nHe will have 3 children in all (3 for the satanic trinity of saytn, antichrist, and false prophet).\nHe will be the antichrist for 8 years because he will be in a coma for 1 year.  While he’s in a coma, his wife tells him she will keep things going for him until he comes out of the coma.  Gullible people will believe he’s God because they were told he was dead and then they suddenly see him alive.  They think he rose from the dead.\nHe will not be slain by Jesus Christ.  He will be slain by St. Michael, the Archangel.\nRevelations was not written by inspiration of the Holy Ghost to the Apostles. Revelations was written by jews.\nRead the Apocalypse.  That was written by one of the 4 evangelist apostles.  Forgive me if memory alludes me these days.\nHope this helps to clear some things up.\nJan 19, 2018, 12:54 pm\nFirmament Does Exist\nDouray-Reims “Bible” is a translation based off the Latin vulagate into English….there are way better translations, The Scriptures from Institute for Scripture Research, The Word of YAH, etc… Which are translated from Hebrew or Greek to English way before the Latin from Rome.\nMatithYAHUW 26:2 “You know that after two YAoms, the Pesach (Passover) is coming and The Son of AHdam will be delivered up to be mailed to a execution pole.’\nMatithYAHUW 26:2 “You know that after two days the Pesah takes place, and the Son of Adam is to be delivered up to be impaled”.\nJan 19, 2018, 6:28 pm\nYou would be very surprised at who the Anti-Christ really is.\nIn fact, you will be SHOCKED!\nJan 19, 2018, 2:42 pm\nRockledge\nThe antiChrist ( more accurately, psuedo-Christ or pretend-Christian)  is most likely going to be an american President,  mostly likely republican,  and helped into power by the one world religion ( if you think all the TV charlatans are just serving themselves by begging for money to put more satellites up so they can get the “word of God) out to the world,  guess again)\nMystery Babylon is no longer a mystery.   Do an Excite or Bing search,  or any other search engine.  for BABYLON WEATHER RADAR and see what it shows you .\nJan 19, 2018, 6:44 pm\nRelelation 13:18 English Standard Version\n“This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.”\nMan is a thief, liar,and murderer. He is a raging beast.  Man is made up of carbon and is carbon-based life.  Carbon has six protons attached to six neutrons with six electrons orbiting the two energy shells.  This is what is the number of a man, any man, all men.\nWe are Satan, but we can also decide to be God. We can be a raging beast, theif, liar and murderer, or we can be Love.\nJan 20, 2018, 6:46 am\nCLICK HERE TO UPLOAD NEWS!\n\"Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the  Lord of hosts.\"  Zechariah 4:6\nRead it..\nSubmit\nToday's Top Stories\nFeatured\nPortions copyright © 2019 NSearch Technology, Inc., All Rights Reserved.\nBefore It's News® is a registered Service Mark of NSearch Technology,     Inc..\nLooks like you’re using an ad-blocker.\nThis site is supported by ads.
