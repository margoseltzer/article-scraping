(Photo: Mauser)\nMauser returns with a new rifle, the M18, granting German rifle enthusiasts the opportunity to nab the iconic name.\nJoining the Mauser lineup, the M18 features an ultra-rugged synthetic stock designed to withstand harsh hunting environments. Equipped with a three-position safety, the company says the design allows for a round in the chamber free from concerns over the bolt moving out of battery. The M18 delivers a steel receiver that protects the action while the cold-hammer-forged barrel looks to land consistent shots on target.\nThe M18 comes with a bevy of features including two areas of soft-inlay on the stock, a five-round magazine and an adjustable trigger.\n“Being able to produce a rifle this good at such an affordable price means more sportsmen than ever before can realize their dream of owning a Mauser,” Christian Socher, CEO of Blaser USA, Mauser’s North American distributor, said in a press release. “The value of the M18 lies not only in its price but also in its ultimate reliability, durability, and accuracy. This is a rifle for the everyday hunter, incorporating features they rely on, and it will get the job done time after time. That’s why we’re calling it ‘Volkswaffe’: ‘the people’s rifle’.”\nThough 6.5 Creedmoor will eventually join the M18 lineup, for now hunters will have to settle for .243 Win, .308 Win, .270 Win, .30-06, 7mm Rem. Mag and .300 Win Mag. The Mauser M18 starts at $699.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
