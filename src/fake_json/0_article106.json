        "text": "By RedState (Reporter)\nTotal:\nDefense Secretary Mattis Treated to Unusual Military Display (and You’ll Want to See What Happens With These Snakes)\nWednesday, January 24, 2018 11:41\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nI don’t know what this has to do with military readiness or if it makes them better soldiers, but they get props for their unique flair.\nDefense Secretary James Mattis was the guest at a grand military display by Indonesia’s troops. How it would go over in the U.S., I’m not so sure, but somebody should make a reality TV show out of it.\nOf those feats, there was rolling in broken glass, breaking bricks over their heads, fire walking, and drinking snake blood.\nYeah. I just said that. Drinking snake blood, because, of course.\nThe group of reporters traveling with Mattis on the three-day trip to Indonesia had been told he would view a routine military demonstration at Indonesia’s armed forces headquarters.\nI’m flabbergasted, in the most wonderful way.\nOne Indonesian soldier who wore a hood over his face used a knife to cut a cucumber that was in his colleague’s mouth. Another blindfolded man shot a balloon that was in between another soldier’s legs. One of the shots missed, but Reuters  reported  no one appeared to have been injured.\nOH… that could have gone SO badly.\nThen they trotted the guys with the venomous snakes out – even a King Cobra, which was dropped near Mattis. Before anything could happen, they cut off the heads and drank the blood.\nOne guy even decided to go above and beyond, and he bit into a snake while it was still alive.\n“You could imagine how much training went into each individual there, that they were able to do that,” Mattis later told reporters aboard his plane. “When you watch a force do that, many small things, perfectly, you can imagine that they can also put the bigger things together.”\nOther Indonesian forces broke concrete bricks with their heads and smashed piles of burning blocks with their hands.\nThese are some baaaaaaad men.\nGet this…\nWith the theme to “Mission Impossible” playing, they conducted a mock hostage rescue.\nAll of this is part of the Indonesian military’s attempts to mend fences with the Pentagon, after some human rights abuses of the 90s resulted in a restriction of the relationship.\nWhatever the outcome, you have to see this:\nSpecial forces in Indonesia demonstrates to Mattis their ability to eat snakes. pic.twitter.com/I24p5adzsG\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
