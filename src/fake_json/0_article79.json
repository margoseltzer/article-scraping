        "text": "By Jenifer Wilson\nThursday, January 25, 2018 7:12\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nThe odds are that you’ve heard about one of the most talked about women of 2017 Meghan Markle. Some of you know her as the lucky fiancée of Prince Harry, some may know her as Rachael Zane from Suits, but did you know that she is the United Nations Women ambassador and has a degree in international studies from Northwestern University? Markle shares her advice for success in the book The Game Changers, which features inspiring stories from forty fabulous women. Here are her secrets.\nSECRET 1: THINK LONG-TERM\n \nSECRET 2: DON’T BE TOO HARSH ON YOURSELF\nIt’s ok not to be perfect. You shouldn’t be pushing yourself to the limit if you know that it is hurting you. Be kind to yourself and value your time, emotional and physical health.

There’s a poise and a calm to Meghan Markle that translated well for the Rachel Zane role; spirit, adventurousness & a firm grip on the real world. This is a very strong lady who will make a difference, together with the most engaged & positively activist members of the Royal Family — not just Prince Harry, but also the Prince of Wales & the Duchess of Cornwall, both of whom have a passionate zest for life and doing genuinely Good Works.\nAs the writer in social studies at the official site acewriters I believe this is an important milestone moment in remembering what the real purpose is of having “privileges,” advantages, wealth, status, the world’s attention: Helping Others. Even just by opening more minds, breaking away from stereotypes and putting one’s best foot forward. Less cursing, less partying, more rolling up of sleeves and creating lasting changes for a sustainable future in which everyone’s opportunities are improved, so long as their heart is in the right place (and not on monetizing their offices, crafting secret schemes to ruin others, vapid self-promotion for the sake of self-aggrandizement, or simply indulging in mindless hedonistic excess).\nWell done, all! Kudos to all the parents and grandparents, living and deceased.\nJan 31, 2018, 8:44 am\nCLICK HERE TO UPLOAD NEWS!\n\"Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the  Lord of hosts.\"  Zechariah 4:6\nRead it..\nSubmit\nToday's Top Stories\nTop Alternative\nPortions copyright © 2019 NSearch Technology, Inc., All Rights Reserved.\nBefore It's News® is a registered Service Mark of NSearch Technology,     Inc..\nLooks like you’re using an ad-blocker.\nThis site is supported by ads.
