        "text": "By economic news\nTotal:\nSessions in Full Panic - Trump Just Discovered Who Deleted FBI Text Messages\nTuesday, January 23, 2018 21:22\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions was just questioned for hours about the Russian nonsense about them meddling with the election. That was a joke, but now Sessions might be in panic mode after what was just discovered about who deleted the FBI text messages. Even though the FBI released about 50,000 text messages that were shared between FBI’s investigator Peter Strzok and FBI Attorney Lisa Page, there was still a gap of messages that went missing. There are a few reasons why Strzok and Page wouldn’t want any of these messages revealed.\nAny work related text messages were understood to happen, but the couple was having an affair. Page was Strzok’s mistress. If that information leak weren’t damning enough, then they would be shaking in their boots, even more, when the rest of the critical information is revealed. This information could involve anything from the secret society meeting that allegedly happened around the time of Trump winning the election, to Russian meddling and fake news, to an attempt to take Trump and his family out of the Presidency.\nThe lack of transparency and potential alienation of the FBI to the United States is overwhelming, and readers are head over heels with a ton of information to filter through. 50,000 text messages is a lot of deciphering. Then to find out there’s a potential five-month span that is missing? Well, that’s going to be a long few nights of reading. It might take a team of analysts to figure out what’s going on in all those text messages between Strzok and Page.\nHow does anyone get any work done if they’re texting 50,000 times?\nSessions will have to act upon this, which is exactly why he should be extremely nervous. Can you now see why Comey got out while he could? Sessions might also find himself being implicated in something. We won’t know until the five-month period of missing text messages is recovered.\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
