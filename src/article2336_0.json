        "text": "By TOTAL FLANKER\nSaturday, October 7, 2017 15:47\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nFrom time to time I’ve been known to get on my high horse about the RFU launching yet another England rugby kit and expecting the great English rugby public to swallow a load of old marketing bollocks about the kit’s historic significance and/or astonishing technical capabilities.\nAnd so, as we head towards the November 2017 Internationals, I’m sure we are all delighted by the launch of England’s new alternative dark grey combo which will be worn against Argentina next month and by the women’s team against Canada.\nNOTHING TO SEE HERE\nThe problem is, sadly, that you won’t be able to see the kit in the above picture because, apparently, it uses state-of-the-art camouflage technology.\nYes, according to a RFU press release: “Inspired by distraction principles, the red fade feature [on the kit] is designed to make it harder to distinguish aspects of the body during the tackle.”\nSeriously, you couldn’t make it up.\nOr maybe you could – and in fact I did – here and again here .\nOnce again, however, truth proves stranger than fiction.
