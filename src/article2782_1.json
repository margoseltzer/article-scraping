Craig Hoffman of 106.7 The Fan shared Pryor's comments (warning: NSFW language), which noted an NFL employee had to stand by him after the racial slurs started.\nTMZ Sports ¬†passed along footage on its YouTube page (warning: NSFW language) that revealed Pryor raised his middle finger at a fan.\nPryor apologized to his teammates and the Washington organization in his post but acknowledged interactions like the one he had are why some NFL players have elected to protest racial inequality by kneeling during the national anthem.\nOn the field, Pryor finished with three catches for 70 yards and a touchdown‚Äîhis first as a member of Washington. However, a field goal by Harrison Butker and last-second defensive touchdown by Justin Houston sealed the win for the Chiefs.\nFacebook Logo\nTwitter Logo\nFantasy Impact of CLE-HOU Deal\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Nick Chubb a must-start RB1 üìà Duke Johnson a PPR threat üìâ Lamar Miller‚Äôs value tumbles\nDuke Johnson Traded to Texans\nTexans send Browns a 2020 fourth-round pick that 'can become a third-rounder'\nTurner Logo\n",
