        "text": "Image copyright PA Media\n\nDonald Trump has been \"disrespectful\" towards the prime minister and the UK, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said.\n\nHis comments come after President Trump called Sir Kim Darroch, the UK ambassador to the US, \"a very stupid guy\" amid a row over leaked emails.\n\nHe went on to criticise Theresa May over Brexit, saying she had ignored his advice and gone her \"own foolish way\".\n\nOn Sunday emails revealed the ambassador had called the Trump administration \"clumsy and inept\".\n\nMeanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox's scheduled meeting with the US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in the US was cancelled on Tuesday.\n\nMr Hunt responded to Mr Trump's latest outburst by tweeting: \"Friends speak frankly so I will: These comments are disrespectful and wrong to our prime minister and my country.\"\n\nThe Tory leadership hopeful also said he would keep Sir Kim in his post until he retires at Christmas.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt clashed over future of UK's top diplomat in the US in a TV debate\n\nDuring a televised debate, Boris Johnson, the current Tory leadership frontrunner, was pushed on whether he would keep the ambassador, but said he \"wouldn't be so presumptuous\" as to think he would be in a position to do that.\n\nMr Johnson said he had \"a good relationship\" with the White House and that it was important to have a \"close partnership\" with the US.\n\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the row was a reminder of the \"tricky and sensitive\" nature of the UK's relationship with the US and the challenge facing the Tory leadership hopefuls in dealing with a president \"who seems to love stirring up controversy\".\n\nShe said: \"It's Jeremy Hunt, normally seen as the more cautious of the two, who's speaking much more plainly and directly to Donald Trump on the matter, while Boris Johnson has said only that he's not embarrassed about being close to the White House.\"\n\nFollowing Mr Trump's comments on Monday that the US would \"no longer deal\" with Sir Kim, the US State Department said it would continue \"to deal with any accredited individuals until we get any further guidance from the White House or the president\".\n\n\"We have an incredibly special and strategic relationship with the United Kingdom that has gone on for quite a long time - it's bigger than any individual or government,\" the department added.\n\nEarlier, Downing Street reaffirmed its \"full support\" for Sir Kim.\n\nA spokesman for Theresa May said that Sir Kim is \"a dutiful, respected government official\" and confirmed there are no plans for Mrs May and Mr Trump to hold a call to discuss relations following the leak.\n\nNumber 10 also confirmed that Sir Kim would not be attending a meeting between Ivanka Trump and the International Trade Secretary Liam Fox in Washington.\n\nThe spokesman said: \"He isn't attending that meeting but he is supporting Liam Fox in other ways on his trip.\"\n\nEarlier on Tuesday Mr Trump tweeted: \"The wacky Ambassador that the U.K. foisted upon the United States is not someone we are thrilled with, a very stupid guy.\n\n\"He should speak to his country, and Prime Minister May, about their failed Brexit negotiation, and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was handled.\n\n\"I told @theresa_may how to do that deal, but she went her own foolish way-was unable to get it done. A disaster!\n\n\"I don't know the Ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool. Tell him the USA now has the best Economy & Military anywhere in the World, by far...and they are both only getting bigger, better and stronger...Thank you, Mr. President!\"\n\nNumber 10 previously called the leak, reported in the Mail on Sunday, \"unfortunate\" and has begun a formal investigation. It said the UK and US still shared a \"special and enduring\" relationship.\n\nConfidential emails from the UK's ambassador contained a string of criticisms of Mr Trump and his administration, and said the White House was \"uniquely dysfunctional\" and divided under his presidency.\n\nSir Kim, who became ambassador to the US in January 2016 about a year before Mr Trump took office, also questioned whether the White House \"will ever look competent\" but also warned that the US president should not be written off.\n\nThe emails, dating from 2017, said rumours of \"infighting and chaos\" in the White House were mostly true and policy on sensitive issues such as Iran was \"incoherent, chaotic\".",

        "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump: \"The ambassador has not served the UK well\"\n\nPolice have been urged to open a criminal investigation into the leak of diplomatic emails which described the Trump administration as \"inept\".\n\nTom Tugendhat, chairman of the foreign affairs committee, told MPs he made the request in a letter to the Met Police.\n\nThe government has already launched an internal inquiry, saying it \"utterly deplores\" the publication of the memos.\n\nUS President Donald Trump renewed his attack on the UK ambassador, Sir Kim Darroch, whose comments were leaked.\n\nIn a string of tweets about the UK, he said the US \"will no longer deal with him\", as well as making critical comments about Prime Minister Theresa May and her approach to Brexit.\n\nMr Trump's comments come after No 10 said the prime minister had \"full faith\" in the UK ambassador in Washington following the leak.\n\nEmails from the UK's ambassador, leaked to the Mail on Sunday, said Mr Trump's White House was \"uniquely dysfunctional\" and \"divided\".\n\nThe prime minister's spokesman said it was \"the job of ambassadors to provide honest and unvarnished opinions\" but Mrs May \"does not agree with the assessment\".\n\nHe added: \"The leak is absolutely unacceptable and, as you would expect, contact has been made with the Trump administration setting out our view that we believe that it is unacceptable.\"\n\nForeign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan told the House of Commons police could be involved if evidence of wrongdoing over the breach of confidentiality was found.\n\n\"The most important focus is to establish who is responsible for this despicable leak,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Sir Kim Darroch said the White House is \"uniquely dysfunctional\"\n\nEarlier, Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC the leak was \"unprofessional, unethical and unpatriotic\", adding that whoever released the emails had \"maliciously\" undermined the defence and security relationship with the US.\n\n\"I hope if we can identify the individual, either the full force of internal discipline - or if necessary the law - will be brought to bear because this sort of behaviour has no place in public life,\" he said.\n\nBut Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Sir Kim had been \"betrayed\" and \"hung out to dry even though his only crime was to tell the truth\".\n\nShe added: \"He told the truth about Donald Trump and that was because it was his job.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Emily Thornberry responds to Sir Kim Darroch leak\n\nAnalysis: Damage is 'considerable'\n\nBy James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent\n\nJust imagine if every heavily encrypted report to Whitehall from all UK ambassadors overseas was instantly available on your mobile.\n\nThe candour would cease immediately and they'd become ultra-bland and useless as a tool in policy-making.\n\nSo, damage in this case is considerable. There will be a large number of potential suspects.\n\nDiplomatic telegrams are seen by scores, often hundreds of people - ministers and officials - across several departments. That is to ensure grown-up and private conversations can be had based on large amounts of source material.\n\nOf course, there is damage to relations between the UK and the Trump White House too.\n\nMr Trump likes to dish out insults and criticism (remember his frequent belittling of Theresa May over Brexit, and his all out verbal attacks on the mayor of London) but he is pretty thin-skinned when the verbal arrows are aimed at him.\n\nThe one person who is not under suspicion in London is Sir Kim himself. After all, as his current political master, Mr Hunt, has made clear, he was just doing his job.\n\nAs the Foreign Office launched an investigation into the source of the leak to the Mail on Sunday, Mr Trump told reporters in New Jersey: \"We're not big fans of that man and he has not served the UK well.\n\n\"So I can understand it and I can say things about him but I won't bother.\"\n\nIn the emails, the UK ambassador to Washington said: \"We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept.\"\n\nSir Kim questioned whether this White House \"will ever look competent\" but also warned the US president should not be written off.\n\nFrank opinions\n\nDating from 2017 to the present day, the leaked emails said rumours of \"infighting and chaos\" in the White House were mostly true and policy on sensitive issues such as Iran was \"incoherent, chaotic\".\n\nAlthough the Mueller investigation later found allegations of conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia were not proven, Sir Kim's emails said \"the worst cannot be ruled out\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt reacts to the UK ambassador's leaked emails about US President Donald Trump\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said if Boris Johnson becomes prime minister and the UK leaves the EU by 31 October, \"people like\" Sir Kim would \"not be around\".\n\nAsked about speculation that he might take on the diplomatic role, Mr Farage said: \"I don't think I'm the right man for the job\", adding that he was \"not a diplomat\".\n\nHowever, he said he \"could be very useful\" when dealing with the US administration.\n\nWho is Sir Kim Darroch?\n\nSir Kim is the British ambassador to the US, which means he represents the Queen and UK government interests in the US.\n\nBorn in South Stanley, County Durham in 1954, he attended Durham University where he read zoology.\n\nDuring a 42-year diplomatic career, he has specialised in national security issues and European Union policy.\n\nIn 2007, Sir Kim served in Brussels as UK permanent representative to the EU.\n\nHe was the prime minister's national security adviser between 2012 and 2015, dealing with issues such as the rise of the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, Russian annexation of Crimea, the nuclear threat from Iran and the collapse of government authority in Libya.\n\nHe became ambassador to the US in January 2016, a year before Donald Trump's presidential inauguration.",

This is a divided Administration'\n\nThe cache also includes diplomatic telegrams – known as 'DipTel' in Foreign Office jargon – updating Downing Street on political events in the US and providing commentary on Trump's foreign policy decisions.\n\nThey reveal details of highly sensitive negotiations over efforts to curb Iran's nuclear weapons programme, as well as the disarray surrounding the President's handling of recent attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nOne memo, sent by Sir Kim on June 22, refers to 'incoherent, chaotic' US-Iran policy, adding: 'Its unlikely that US policy on Iran is going to become more coherent any time soon. This is a divided Administration'.\n\nHe questioned Trump's recent claim that he aborted a missile strike on Iran because it would have caused a predicted 150 casualties, saying it 'doesn't stand up'.\n\n'It's more likely that he was never fully on board and that he was worried about how this apparent reversal of his 2016 campaign promises would look come 2020' – at the next Presidential election.\n\nAnother memo, sent on June 10, warns of tensions ahead over Brexit: 'As we advance our agenda of deepening and strengthening trading arrangements, divergences of approach on climate change, media freedoms and the death penalty may come to the fore.'\n\nThe leak of diplomatic cables is extremely unusual and will raise new questions about morale in the Civil Service.\n\nWhen dealing with Trump you need to make your points simple, even blunt\n\nThere is mounting evidence that Brexit has politicised many mandarins, with officials who privately support Brexit accusing the Civil Service of trying to stop the UK leaving the EU.\n\nDarroch, who became British Ambassador to Washington in January 2016, is a former UK Permanent Representative to the EU and widely regarded as a europhile.\n\nThe Foreign Office last night said that the British public 'would expect our Ambassadors to provide Ministers with an honest, unvarnished assessment of the politics in their countries'.\n\nA spokesman added: 'Their views are not necessarily the views of Ministers or indeed the Government. But we pay them to be candid, just as the US Ambassador here will send back his reading of Westminster politics and personalities.\n\n'Of course we would expect such advice to be handled by Ministers and civil servants in the right way and it's important that our Ambassadors can offer their advice and for it remain confidential.\n\n'Our team in Washington have strong relations with the White House and no doubt that these will withstand such mischievous behaviour.'\n\nTrump's speeches are 'full of false claims' and the White House 'will never look competent': Ambassador's withering views reveal scale of concern British Government has about President\n\nIt was summer 2017, and Britain's National Security Council was convening to discuss a problem. President Trump had been in office for 150 days, and Prime Minister Theresa May and her Cabinet colleagues were still struggling to get a handle on his chaotic Administration. They needed advice.\n\nAt his desk in his splendid official residence in Washington DC, the British Ambassador, Sir Kim Darroch was trying to help. Britain's National Security Adviser Sir Mark Sedwill had asked him to put together some thoughts on the President's personality and leadership style, and he was compiling a briefing note.\n\nCopied to a 'strictly limited' number of senior figures in Downing Street and the Foreign Office, it ran to six pages of highly unflattering observations about the President's character and political record.\n\nIn the confidential memo – marked 'Official Sensitive' – the UK's most important diplomat accused Trump of 'radiating insecurity', filling his speeches with 'false claims and invented statistics' and achieving 'almost nothing' in terms of domestic policy.\n\nEarlier, Sedwill had sent Sir Kim an outline presentation for the meeting. Sir Kim thought the slides 'looked good'. There was just one point he felt he needed to correct: 'My only disagreement with the slides: I don't think this Administration will ever look competent,' he declared.\n\nIt was an extraordinarily damning assessment. The problem was that Ministers and diplomats had to find a way to deal with the President.\n\nSir Kim highlighted how America was still the UK's No 1 security partner and the 'cultural and historical ties' between the two countries were 'profound'. The UK needed America: as an export market; for defence and intelligence cooperation; and for a post-Brexit trade deal.\n\n'The starting point is that this is our single most important bilateral relationship,' Sir Kim wrote.\n\nBut he added: 'As seen from here, we really don't believe that this Administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional, less unpredictable, less faction-riven, less diplomatically clumsy and inept.'\n\nThere's no upside in being subtle, let alone being ambiguous\n\nHe therefore compiled a three-point guide for how Britain's politicians and officials should handle this most unpredictable of Presidents. His first suggestion was to 'flood the zone', which meant influencing as many of the President's key advisers as possible.\n\nSir Kim said Trump spends his days in the Oval Office asking his White House team, Cabinet members and senior Republicans for their opinions 'on the business of the moment'.\n\nBut, crucially, the diplomat also highlighted how the President spends his evenings phoning his friends outside the administration 'seeking reinforcement or a different take'. Many of these friends have been 'cultivated' by the British, Sir Kim boasted.\n\n'It's important to 'flood the zone': you want as many as possible of those who Trump consults to give him the same answer,' he wrote. 'So we need to be creative in using all the channels available to us through our relationships with his Cabinet, the White House staff, and our contacts among his outside friends.'\n\nSir Kim's second recommendation was for Theresa May to call Trump more often, stressing 'there is no consistently reliable substitute for the personal phone call from the Prime Minister'.\n\nSir Kim said Trump spends his days in the Oval Office asking his White House team, Cabinet members and senior Republicans for their opinions 'on the business of the moment'\n\n'The President respects and likes her,' he added. 'I know they have already talked several times. But in a perfect world, they would be speaking two or three times a month, if not more.'\n\nThe diplomat's third pointer was to urge Britain's politicians and officials to use flattery and to pander to the President's ego when they come into contact with him.\n\n'You need to start praising him for something that he's done recently,' he advised. 'You need whenever possible to present them as wins for him.' In comments which could be viewed as highly patronising, Sir Kim also advised his bosses to make their points 'simple' and 'even blunt', adding: 'as a senior White House adviser told me, there is no upside with this President in being subtle, let alone ambiguous.'\n\nHis stark assessment reveals the scale of concern at the highest level in the British Government about Trump. By summer 2017, the President had torn up the Paris climate change accord; junked key international trade agreements and launched military strikes against Syria. Western allies were reeling: he didn't seem to care who he upset.\n\nYou need to start by praising him for something he's done recently\n\nBut while Trump was making waves on the world stage, his domestic programme was getting nowhere, Sir Kim said.\n\nThe President's big election pledges – building a wall between the US and Mexico; stopping Muslims from certain countries coming to America and reforming tax and healthcare – had all hit the buffers.\n\n'Of the main campaign promises, not an inch of the Wall has been built; the executive orders on travel bans from Muslim countries have been blocked by the state courts; tax reform and the infrastructure package have been pushed into the middle distance; and the repeal and replacement of Obamacare is on a knife edge,' Sir Kim wrote. The Ambassador 'wouldn't bet a tenner' on Trump's health proposals passing through the Senate.\n\nSir Kim's confidential letter, sent to Sedwill, who is now also the Cabinet Secretary, on June 22, 2017, is unsparing in its assessment of the President's personality flaws and the chaos of his administration.\n\nIn language that is likely to prove highly embarrassing for Sir Kim, the Ambassador declared: 'For a man who has risen to the highest office on the planet, President Trump radiates insecurity.'\n\nHe highlighted how the Administration had been 'dogged from day one by stories of vicious infighting and chaos inside the White House, and swamped by scandals – all, one way or another, linked to Russia.'\n\nAnd while the President would deride media stories about such chaos as 'fake news', Sir Kim privately advised his bosses in London to believe what they were reading in the newspapers. 'The stories about White House knife fights are, we judge, mostly true: multiple sources and confirmed by our own White House contacts. This is a uniquely dysfunctional environment.' He warned Whitehall to be braced for more presidential outbursts including the use of 'immoderate, sometimes offensive, language', like his attacks on London Mayor Sadiq Khan.\n\n'There is no filter,' Darroch advised. 'And we could also be at the beginning of a downward spiral, rather than just a rollercoaster: something could emerge that leads to disgrace and downfall.'\n\nBut while warning Whitehall that Trump's White House could collapse under the weight of scandal, he also urged the British Government not to write Trump off.\n\nThe President, he noted, has been mired in scandal most of his life but has always survived.\n\nSir Kim drew a parallel with The Terminator, a 1984 science fiction film featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cyborg that is almost impossible to destroy.\n\n'Trump may emerge from the flames, battered but intact, like Schwarzenegger in the final scenes of The Terminator.'\n\nLooking to the future, Sir Kim warned 'there are real risks on the horizon' and that Trump 'will do or say things we oppose'.\n\n'This 'America First' Administration could do some profoundly damaging things to the world trade system: such as denounce the WTO, tear up existing trade details, launch protectionist action, even against allies. It could further undermine international action on climate change, or further cut UN funding.' He said that Trump's 'spontaneous' missile strike on a Syrian airbase in April 2017 had won him 'the best headlines of his brief time in the Oval Office' but warned that 'a less well judged military intervention is not inconceivable.'\n\nIn the face of the chaos, Sir Kim highlighted how German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and French President Emmanuel Macron, were busy distancing themselves from Trump. But Sir Kim warned London: 'I don't think we should follow them.'\n\nHe admitted it could be rocky, but suggested that sometimes it might make sense to criticise the President, 'provided we are careful'. Sir Kim added: 'Arguably, you get more respect from this President if you stand up to him occasionally – provided the public comments do not come as a surprise and are judicious, calm and avoid personalising.'\n\nToday he may regret that his confidential memo does not meet that test.\n\nIndeed, last night, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, a friend of the President, called for Sir Kim to leave his post, saying: 'The sooner he is gone the better.'\n\nThe council house kid who ended up with a plum job: How Sir Kim Darroch secured a prestige position by winning scholarship to £20,000 private school before taking Foreign Office role because 'they were the first to offer him work'\n\nSir Kim Darroch's gilded lifestyle, meeting the great and the good at Britain's lavish Ambassador's residence in Washington DC, is a world away from the council flat he grew up in.\n\nHis parents split up when he was just six years old, forcing his family to leave behind their hitherto comfortable life in Nairobi, Kenya, where his father taught in a private school.\n\nHis mother Edna moved Kim and his younger brother back to Britain and into a flat on a council estate in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.\n\nFrom there, many boys would have gone on to work in manual employment. But Kim, a bright student, had other ideas.\n\nAfter soaring through the entrance exams, he won a free scholarship to attend Abingdon School, a leading public school that charges £20,000 a year for day pupils.\n\nAfter soaring through the entrance exams, he won a free scholarship to attend Abingdon School (pictured), a leading public school that charges £20,000 a year for day pupils\n\n'I think I was the only person in the school uniform walking out of this council estate every morning to go to school,' he recalled in a recent interview.\n\n'I think what it teaches you is that all things are possible no matter where you come from, if you put the work in.'\n\nAfter finishing his A-levels, he studied zoology at Durham University because – in his own words – he was 'naturally lazy' and it was an 'easier option'.\n\nHe joined the Foreign Office in 1977 after graduating because 'they were the first people to offer me a job' and started his ascent through the ranks at Embassies around the world, including top roles dealing with EU bureaucrats in Brussels.\n\nWhen he landed the most prestigious diplomatic post in the Foreign Office – British Ambassador to the United States – in 2016, Barack Obama was winding down his presidency. Sir Kim and his wife Vanessa, who he married in 1978, soon settled into the comfortable private apartment in the Embassy, widely regarded as the finest in Washington DC.\n\nIt has a ballroom, boutique hotel-style guest rooms, a library and beautiful gardens. It was his reward for 40 years in the Civil Service, and he threw himself into the social whirl. The residence hosts almost 800 breakfasts, lunches, dinners and cocktail parties a year, and Sir Kim reportedly shows up at 90 per cent of them.\n\nHis job was relatively straightforward – until Donald Trump arrived.\n\nDays after winning the Presidential election in November 2016, Trump was tweeting that he'd prefer his friend Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, to be Britain's Ambassador to the US.\n\nDays after winning the Presidential election in November 2016, Trump was tweeting that he'd prefer his friend Nigel Farage (pictured with Trump in August 2016), the former Ukip leader, to be Britain's Ambassador to the US\n\nNo 10 insisted it was for Britain to decide who serves as its Ambassador, while Sir Kim bit his tongue. But it's clear Trump created unprecedented challenges even for this most experienced of diplomats.\n\nThere is no doubting Sir Kim's deep patriotism (his mobile phone cover is a Union Jack) and colleagues in the Foreign Office consider him to be a first rate diplomat. However, it is his long postings in Brussels that have earned him a reputation as a europhile, and he is mistrusted by Brexiteers.\n\nHe was Tony Blair's top Europe adviser from 2004 to 2007 and then became Britain's Permanent Representative to the EU from 2007 and 2011.\n\nKnighted in 2008, he became David Cameron's National Security Advisor, from January 2012 to September 2015, before his Washington posting.\n\nNow aged 65, Darroch is nearing the end of his diplomatic career.\n\nEven before today's revelations in The Mail on Sunday, few expected him to survive in Washington DC after the next UK Prime Minister takes office.\n\nNow these unfortunate leaks may just hasten his departure.\n\nBut Ambassador STILL says The Donald can win again!\n\nDonald Trump could win a second term in the White House, Sir Kim Darroch told Downing Street, saying there is a 'credible path' for him to sweep to victory in next year's Presidential election.\n\nIn a leaked diplomatic cable sent on June 20, the Ambassador reported how two days earlier the President had 'electrified' an audience of 20,000 supporters in Orlando, Florida, at a huge rally to launch his re-election campaign.\n\nA senior British diplomat was in the Amway Center, an indoor sports stadium, to witness the event and report back to Sir Kim.\n\nIn a leaked diplomatic cable sent on June 20, the Ambassador reported how two days earlier the President had 'electrified' an audience of 20,000 supporters in Orlando, Florida, at a huge rally to launch his re-election campaign (pictured)\n\nThe Ambassador told London that while the President had not offered any new policies, 'the crowd could not have been happier'.\n\n'The atmosphere was unique – somewhere between a major sporting event (where only the home team fans are in the crowd) and a mega-church. Indeed the event kicked off with prayers from a pastor who asked God to 'tear down' opposition to the President.'\n\nSir Kim said the audience was a 'sea of the now iconic red MAGA [Make American Great Again] caps. The crowd looked almost exclusively white, with a pretty even mix of men and women, young and old: there were families in every stand. For some, attending had meant a long wait in 30C heat and humidity.'\n\nSir Kim said the audience was a 'sea of the now iconic red MAGA [Make American Great Again] caps. The crowd looked almost exclusively white, with a pretty even mix of men and women, young and old: there were families in every stand. For some, attending had meant a long wait in 30C heat and humidity'\n\nSir Kim predicted that the President's campaign strategy will be to 'go with what he knows best' and appeal to his core supporters.\n\nHe noted how the enthusiasm of his 'die-hard fans' is undiminished after two-and-a-half years in the Oval Office. In comments that could anger the White House, Sir Kim reported that: 'As is standard at these rallies, the language was incendiary, and a mix of fact and fiction – hard to reconcile with [Vice President Mike] Pence's remarks about governing for all Americans.'\n\nA key difference between when Trump last ran for President in 2016 is that the machinery of the Republican Party is 'four-square behind him', Sir Kim said.\n\nSir Kim said the President still faces hurdles – including the prospect of the Democrats picking a candidate more popular than the widely disliked Hillary Clinton, who fought the last election.\n\nHe also said Trump cannot afford to lose much support and stressed that the President has made no meaningful efforts to 'diversify his base'.\n\n'All that said, there is still a credible path for Trump – but so much rides on who the Democrats choose in July 2020.'\n\nHow Trump told British Ambassador the special relationship felt 'closer and stronger' after state visit but warned 'don't expect any special favours'\n\nAs the President and First Lady boarded Air Force One at Southampton, Sir Kim Darroch breathed a sigh of relief. Their State visit to the UK was finally over and, despite minor hiccups, it had been a resounding success.\n\nMoments earlier, on the Tarmac, Donald Trump had taken his leave of the various UK Government officials and dignitaries who had gathered to see him off.\n\nThe formalities – six months in the planning – were now over. All that remained was for Sir Kim, who had accompanied the President throughout the three-day trip, to bid him farewell. 'This was a wonderful visit, and UK-US relations are now in the best state ever,' Trump told him, shaking his hand.\n\nAs the President and First Lady boarded Air Force One at Southampton, Sir Kim Darroch breathed a sigh of relief. Their State visit to the UK (pictured with the Queen in Buckingham Palace for the State Banquet) was finally over and, despite minor hiccups, it had been a resounding success\n\nThe British Ambassador to Washington could hardly hide his delight.\n\nSomehow he had managed to pull off what had, at times, looked an almost impossible feat: showing America's First Family the very best of British pomp and circumstance and steering him through multiple potentially tricky meetings and engagements, without any unwelcome drama. It was the pinnacle of his 40-year career in the Civil Service.\n\nIran: His missile attack u-turn claim 'doesn't stand up' American policy towards Iran is incoherent and unlikely to improve 'any time soon', according to a devastating memo by Sir Kim Darroch. In a damning indictment of Donald Trump's administration, Britain's Ambassador to Washington described '36 hours of contradictory messaging and decisions' after Iran shot down a US military drone last month. The missile strike by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard took America to the brink of launching a retaliatory attack. But after authorising a strike and boasting of being 'cocked and loaded', President Trump aborted the mission with ten minutes to spare after being told that it might kill as many as 150 people. Blame: The US says Iran attacked this oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman in June Tensions have been escalating between the US and Iran since May 2018, when Trump announced the US was withdrawing from a nuclear agreement with Iran and was reimposing sanctions on the regime. The US has blamed Iran for a series of recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. In his memo, written at 12.39am UK time on June 22, Sir Kim described disarray and confusion across Washington as Trump unexpectedly aborted the attack. 'The Administration said nothing for several hours, awaiting guidance from the White House,' he wrote. 'Even our best contacts were unwilling to take our calls.' Sir Kim said the episode illustrated Trump's 'aversion to new military adventures'. But, astonishingly, he made it clear to London that he did not believe the President's explanation of why he cancelled the attack. 'His claim, however, that he changed his mind because of 150 predicted casualties doesn't stand up; he would certainly have heard this figure in his initial briefing. 'It's more likely that he was never fully on board and that he was worried about how this apparent reversal of his 2016 campaign promises would look come 2020 [at the next election].' He warned that this is a 'divided Administration' and that 'it's unlikely that US policy on Iran is going to become more coherent anytime soon'. And while Trump had stepped back from the brink this time, Sir Kim warned that the President could still trigger a conflict with Iran, noting that he is now 'surrounded by a more hawkish group of advisers'. 'This may, however, only be a temporary pause,' he warned. 'Just one more Iranian attack somewhere in the region could trigger yet another Trump U-turn. Moreover, the loss of a single American life would probably make a critical difference.'\n\nBack at his desk in Washington, almost two weeks later, Sir Kim was still buzzing. He settled down to write a long memo to Prime Minister Theresa May and other senior Government figures reflecting on what had been achieved.\n\n'We are basking in a big success, with doors open everywhere in Washington,' he gushed in a diplomatic cable sent last month and marked 'Official Sensitive'. 'As a result, our relationship with this Administration, at this critical juncture for the UK, feels closer and stronger.'\n\nBut he warned London not to get too carried away, stressing that this was 'still an Administration of 'no special favours'.'\n\n'We might be flavour of the month, but this is still the land of 'America First',' he concluded.\n\nSir Kim could be forgiven for feeling pleased with himself. The smooth running of what was only the third State visit of a US President to the UK (the others were George W Bush and Barack Obama) had been by no means assured.\n\nIndeed, the President had barely entered UK airspace before there were signs of trouble.\n\nMoments before touching down in London, he had fired off a characteristically aggressive tweet about the city's mayor Sadiq Khan, labelling the Labour politician a 'stone cold loser' and making a disparaging comment about his height.\n\nIt was hardly the diplomatic start Sir Kim had hoped for. If the President continued to behave like this, the visit would be a disaster.\n\nFor all the President's bombast, Sir Kim knew he was nervous. He was excited about seeing the Queen again – they had met for the first time almost exactly a year earlier – but had been fretting about messing up.\n\nLast time, he had been accused of various gaffes, and he was 'worried about getting the protocol right', Sir Kim later reported.\n\nThe Ambassador knew that Her Majesty would take any minor slips in her stride. He was much more concerned about the President meeting Prince Charles.\n\nThe President and the heir to the throne did not see eye-to-eye over the environment. What if they had some embarrassing row?\n\nThen there was the diplomatic minefield posed by the looming Tory Party leadership contest. Mrs May was on her way out, and the President would have to decide which of the dozen or so MPs vying for her job he should take time to meet. What if he backed the wrong horse?\n\nFurthermore, there were difficult discussions looming over Chinese telecoms giant Huawei. The President was annoyed by the UK's refusal to cut ties with the company. It could be awkward.\n\nGreatly to Sir Kim's relief, however, everything went to plan.\n\nFrom his splendid official residence on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington DC – once described as 'Downton Abbey on the Potomac' – Sir Kim reflected on what had been achieved.\n\nHe penned a long diplomatic telegram on June 17 on the 'impressions and implications' of the State visit. The memo was sent at 2.15am, UK time, guaranteeing that it would be read at the beginning of the working day in London.\n\n'With this unorthodox President, there were genuine risks… In the event, the gamble paid [off] handsomely,' he wrote in the cable that was sent to No 10 and senior officials across Whitehall.\n\nThough Trump was now 'used to being feted by foreign governments,' the State visit was 'an honour that no other country can match' and Trump had 'revelled in every element of it'.\n\n'The President knew from the outset that it amounted to genuinely special treatment…. Although initially worried about getting the protocol right, he became more relaxed as it progressed; and by the end, he could not have been happier or more fulsome in his assessment,' Sir Kim wrote in the telegram.\n\nAccording to the Ambassador, the highlight for the President had been the 'extensive personal engagement' with the Queen: at a private lunch, at a glittering State banquet, and at the D-Day commemorations in Portsmouth.\n\nCordial: Trump hit it off with Charles - surprisingly. Trump 'seemed to deeply appreciate' the effort the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall made. 'I think the Prince of Wales, despite differing views on climate change, established an open and easy relationship with the President,' he wrote\n\nHowever, he had also got on surprisingly well with Charles and Camilla. Trump 'seemed to deeply appreciate' the effort the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall made. 'I think the Prince of Wales, despite differing views on climate change, established an open and easy relationship with the President,' he wrote.\n\nThroughout the visit, Sir Kim had also been conscious of the need to keep Trump's aides happy. The President had travelled with a huge entourage, all of whom needed to be looked after. That had gone equally well.\n\n'His team were also dazzled, telling us that this had been a visit like no other – the hottest ticket of their careers,' he reported.\n\nRussia: The presidency could crash and burn over Russia links Donald Trump's alleged links to Russia could see his presidency 'crashing and burning', Ambassador Darroch said in one memo. In a controversial briefing note written two years ago, Sir Kim Darroch warned his bosses in London that of all the President's troubles, allegations of collusion between the Trump camp and Russia – since largely disproved – had the greatest potential to finish him. At the time, evidence was mounting that his campaign team had conspired with Vladimir Putin's regime to beat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. There were also unproven claims his son-in-law Jared Kushner may have been indebted to shady Russian moneymen. The British Ambassador feared they might be true. 'The worst cannot be ruled out,' he said, in a letter written for the UK's National Security Adviser Sir Mark Sedwill in June 2017 marked 'Official Sensitive'. 'There could have been active collusion between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence, especially over the timing of release of hacked emails from inside the Clinton camp. Dodgy Russian financiers may have bailed out the Trump and Kushner enterprises when both were at risk of bankruptcy in previous decades,' he declared. A month earlier, in May 2017, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller had launched an investigation. Trump was accused of trying to stop a probe into his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Once again, Sir Kim was uneasy. 'Trump's attempts to close down the FBI investigation... might amount to obstruction of justice,' he said. This would be a criminal offence. He warned Sedwill that Trump could win a second term, but 'we can't rule out his crashing and burning either'. For all his misgivings, Sir Kim also told Sedwill he 'wouldn't bet' on any of it bringing the President down. 'Trump has been mired in scandal pretty much all his life, and has come through it. He seems indestructible,' he wrote.\n\nImpressing Trump's advisers was far more than a matter of manners.\n\nCultivating contacts in the White House and Trump administration was a key part of Sir Kim's job. He liked to call those with the President's ear the 'Trump Whisperers.' Now he was on even better terms with them.\n\n'These are close contacts, with whom we have spent years building relationships: they are the gatekeepers... the individuals we rely upon to ensure the UK voice is heard in the West Wing.\n\n'The visit will make a substantial difference to those relationships too,' he enthused.\n\nOn their return to the US, Sir Kim and his team had 'done the rounds with journalists, pundits and commentators'. Media coverage had been great.\n\n'With some nuances, their view was that we had pulled off a difficult task: a largely gaffe-free visit which had made a President who often stumbled on foreign trips look good, and which had shown the UK, at a difficult juncture, at its best,' Sir Kim declared.\n\nMercifully little had been made of 'potentially controversial moments' like public protests, the spat with Khan, and 'private meetings with some prominent UK politicians', including Nigel Farage.\n\nInstead, American journalists had focused on 'how much the President appeared to be enjoying himself; how relaxed a relationship he appeared to have developed with the Queen; and how well the talks and lunch with the Prime Minister appear to have gone', Sir Kim wrote.\n\nNow it was a question of capitalising on these gains. The Ambassador told his bosses back home that he would be building on the 'enhanced personal relationship with the Trump inner circle to deliver UK objectives'. Thinking ahead, he felt that the State visit could be used to lay the ground for Theresa May's successor – Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt – to secure an early meeting with the President.\n\nThe new Prime Minister would be 'starting in the best possible place with this President', he said.\n\nHe suggested a possible early meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York in mid-September ('though Brexit considerations may intrude here') or 'in the margins of the Nato summit in December'.\n\nBut the new Prime Minister could also make a formal visit to the White House.\n\n'I am sure that there would be a warm welcome here in Washington if that's what we want to happen,' Sir Kim said.\n\nBut perhaps conscious that his report might sound too self-congratulatory, Sir Kim signed off with a warning that despite the successful visit, America would not cut the UK any slack in trade negotiations and would continue to press the UK to 'choose between them and China'.\n\nThey would measure the UK by 'what resources we bring to the table', he cautioned.",

        "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Robert Mueller: No confidence that there was no crime\n\nUS Special Counsel Robert Mueller has said charging President Donald Trump with a crime was not an option, in his first comments on the Russia inquiry.\n\nHe reiterated that his report did not exonerate the president and that legal guidelines prevent the indictment of a sitting president.\n\nMr Mueller did not rule out testifying in Congress but said he would not give information that was not in his report.\n\nReacting to the remarks, Mr Trump said: \"The case is closed! Thank you.\"\n\nAs special counsel, Mr Mueller was tasked with investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHis 448-page report said it had not established that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to influence the election.\n\nHowever, it did detail 10 instances where Mr Trump had possibly attempted to impede the investigation.\n\nWhat did Mueller say?\n\nHis statement largely reaffirmed what was in the report released with redactions last month.\n\nHe said if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump \"clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so\".\n\nMr Mueller added that \"the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,\" in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Mueller report - in 60 seconds\n\nThe special counsel said he did not believe it was \"appropriate to speak further\" about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team's report.\n\nWith Democratic lawmakers seeking to have him testify in Congress, Mr Mueller said: \"The report is my testimony.\"\n\nHe also announced the formal closure of the special counsel office and his resignation from the justice department to return to private life.\n\n'Read my report'\n\nRobert Mueller didn't break much new ground in his eight-minute statement announcing the official end of the special counsel investigation. Instead, he highlighted in bold what he views as the key points of nearly two years of work.\n\nMr Mueller started and ended by emphasising that America during the 2016 election was under attack by malign foreign actors. He said those allegations deserve the attention of every American.\n\nIn the portion of his investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, Mr Mueller said there was \"insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy\" - hardly the complete vindication the president asserts.\n\nWhen it comes to obstruction of justice, he chipped away further at the president's defences. Mr Trump wasn't exonerated, \"charging the president\" wasn't an option. If Mr Mueller has his way, his role in this drama is at an end. His report speaks for itself, he said, and he wouldn't engage in \"conclusions or hypotheticals about the president\".\n\nThat may not be enough for Democrats in Congress, who still want to question Mr Mueller in person. If Mr Mueller is to be believed, however, all they need to know - all he will offer them - is written in the pages of his report.\n\nAnthony in full: What rare Mueller statement actually meant\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have called on Congress to act and start impeachment proceedings.\n\n\"It is up to Congress to hold this president accountable. We need to start impeachment proceedings,\" said Senator Kamala Harris, who is running for her party's 2020 presidential nomination.\n\nSenator Cory Booker, also a presidential hopeful, said: \"Congress has a legal and moral obligation to begin impeachment proceedings immediately.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why no charge of obstruction of justice? A law professor breaks down the legal questions\n\nBut House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has avoided talking about impeachment, said: \"The Congress holds sacred its constitutional responsibility to investigate and hold the President accountable for his abuse of power.\"\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said \"it falls to Congress to respond to the crimes, lies and other wrongdoings of President Trump - and we will do so.\"\n\nRepresentative Doug Collins, the top Republican at the committee, said \"relitigating... and reinvestigating the special counsel's findings will only further divide our country,\" adding that \"it is time to move on\".\n\nThe first Republican congressman to call for Mr Trump's impeachment, Representative Justin Amash, said: \"The ball is in our court, Congress.\"\n\nMeanwhile White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said: \"After two years, the Special Counsel is moving on with his life, and everyone else should do the same.\"",

        "text": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Trump also repeated his criticism of Mrs May's handling of Brexit\n\nUS President Donald Trump has stepped up his attack on the UK's ambassador in Washington, Sir Kim Darroch, saying \"we will no longer deal with him\".\n\nIn withering comments on Twitter, Mr Trump also lashed out at Theresa May, saying it was \"good news\" that Britain would soon have a new prime minister.\n\nSir Kim, in emails leaked on Sunday, described Mr Trump's administration as dysfunctional and inept.\n\nMrs May said she had \"full faith\" in Sir Kim but did not agree with him.\n\nHer spokesman had described the leak as \"absolutely unacceptable\", and said the prime minister's office had made contact with the White House.\n\nMr Trump had already responded to the leaked emails by saying \"we're not big fans of that man and he has not served the UK well\".\n\nIn Monday's series of tweets he said Sir Kim was \"not liked or well thought of within the US\".\n\nApparently angered by Mrs May's support for the ambassador, he again lashed out at her handling of Brexit, describing it as \"a mess\".\n\nMrs May stepped down after failing to have a Brexit deal approved by parliament and the governing Conservative Party is choosing between two remaining candidates - Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt - to replace her.\n\nThe US state department declined to comment on President Trump's remarks.\n\nIs ambassador now 'persona non grata'?\n\nAnalysis by James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent\n\nBy saying he won't deal with Sir Kim Darroch any more, Donald Trump is apparently all but declaring the ambassador to be persona non grata. That is the formal legal process by which a host government expels a foreign diplomat.\n\nThe key question now is what the president means by the word \"deal\". If the royal \"we\" used by Mr Trump means that his entire administration will no longer deal with Sir Kim or any of his staff then the British government may have to decide to fast track the retirement of their man in Washington.\n\nSir Kim, who is an honourable man and was stepping down anyway in a few months, may decide to resign. If, however, Mr Trump merely means he won't deal personally with Sir Kim then the ambassador may stay on until the new prime minister can make his own appointment.\n\nThis all presents the British government with an awkward dilemma - to buckle under US pressure and bring Sir Kim home, risking accusations of abject weakness, or to stand firm and defend their ambassador for doing his job and telling the truth as he sees it, risking even further damage to the UK/US relationship.\n\nWhat did the leaked emails say?\n\nIn the emails leaked to the Mail on Sunday, Sir Kim said: \"We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept.\"\n\nHe questioned whether this White House \"will ever look competent\" but also warned that the US president should not be written off.\n\nThe emails, dating from 2017, said rumours of \"infighting and chaos\" in the White House were mostly true and policy on sensitive issues such as Iran was \"incoherent, chaotic\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump: \"The ambassador has not served the UK well\"\n\nSir Kim said Mr Trump was \"dazzled\" by his state visit to the UK in June, but warned that his administration would remain self-interested, adding: \"This is still the land of America First.\"\n\nWho is Sir Kim Darroch?\n\nSir Kim represents the Queen and UK government interests in the US.\n\nBorn in South Stanley, County Durham, in 1954, he attended Durham University where he read zoology.\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Sir Kim Darroch described the White House as dysfunctional\n\nDuring a 42-year diplomatic career, he has specialised in national security issues and European Union policy.\n\nIn 2007, Sir Kim served in Brussels as the UK permanent representative to the EU.\n\nHe was the prime minister's national security adviser between 2012 and 2015, dealing with issues such as the rise of the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, Russian annexation of Crimea, the nuclear threat from Iran and the collapse of government authority in Libya.\n\nHe became ambassador to the US in January 2016, a year before Donald Trump's presidential inauguration.",
