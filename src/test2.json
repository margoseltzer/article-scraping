        "text": "Image copyright AFP\n\nThe Trump administration has been labelled \"inept\", insecure and incompetent in leaked emails from the UK ambassador to Washington.\n\nSir Kim Darroch said that the White House was \"uniquely dysfunctional\" and \"divided\" under Donald Trump.\n\nBut he also warned that the US president should not be written off.\n\nThe Foreign Office said the leak of the memos to the Mail on Sunday was \"mischievous\" but did not deny their accuracy.\n\nThe White House has not yet responded to the revelation of the contents of the memos, but it could test the so-called \"special relationship\" between the US and UK.\n\nIn the messages, Sir Kim said: \"We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept.\"\n\nHe questioned whether this White House \"will ever look competent\".\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption The UK ambassador in Washington says Trump needs \"simple, even blunt\" arguments\n\nAlthough Sir Kim said Trump was \"dazzled\" by his state visit to the UK in June, the ambassador warns that his administration will remain self-interested, adding: \"This is still the land of America First\".\n\nDifferences between the US and the UK on climate change, media freedoms and the death penalty might come to the fore as the countries seek to improve trading relations after Brexit, the memos said.\n\nTo get through to the president, \"you need to make your points simple, even blunt\", he said.\n\nIn a message sent last month, Sir Kim branded US policy on Iran as \"incoherent, chaotic\".\n\nMr Trump's publicly stated reason for calling off an airstrike against Tehran with 10 minutes to go - that it would cause 150 casualties - \"doesn't stand up\", Sir Kim said.\n\nInstead, he suggested the president was \"never fully on board\" and did not want to reverse his campaign promise not to involve the US in foreign conflicts.\n\n'Infighting and chaos'\n\nSir Kim said it was \"unlikely that US policy on Iran is going to become more coherent any time soon\" because \"this is a divided administration\".\n\nThe leaked files date from 2017 to the present day, covering the ambassador's early impressions that media reports of \"vicious infighting and chaos\" in the White House were \"mostly true\".\n\nThey also give an assessment of allegations about collusion between the Trump election campaign and Russia, saying \"the worst cannot be ruled out\". The investigation by Robert Mueller has since found those claims were not proven.\n\nA Foreign Office spokesman said the public expects diplomats to provide ministers with an \"honest, unvarnished assessment\" of politics in their country.\n\n\"Their views are not necessarily the views of ministers or indeed the government. But we pay them to be candid,\" he said.\n\nHe said ministers and civil servants would handle this advice \"in the right way\" and ambassadors should be able to offer it confidentially.\n\nThe UK embassy in Washington has \"strong relations\" with the White House and these would continue despite \"mischievous behaviour\" such as this leak, the spokesman said.",

        "text": "Image copyright IRIBNEWS Image caption Iranian TV published pictures of what it says was the wreckage of the US drone\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said the US military was \"cocked and loaded to retaliate\" against Iran, but he changed his mind 10 minutes before planned strikes.\n\nAttacks on three sites were planned in response to the shooting down of a US unmanned drone this week.\n\nMr Trump said he had called off strikes after being told 150 people would die.\n\nHe tweeted: \"10 minutes before the strike I stopped it, not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone.\"\n\nThe late reversal was first reported by the New York Times on Thursday night. The newspaper said the operation had been \"in its early stages\" when Mr Trump stood the US military down.\n\n\"I am in no hurry,\" Mr Trump said on Friday. \"Our military is rebuilt, new, and ready to go, by far the best in the world.\"\n\nMr Trump said Iran had downed the drone on Monday, despite an earlier US military statement that the incident happened at 23:35 GMT on Wednesday (04:05 Iran time on Thursday).\n\nOn Friday, the president told NBC News that he decided not to give final approval to the planned strikes because of the predicted death toll.\n\n\"I didn't like it. I didn't think it was proportionate,\" he said.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @MeetThePress EXCLUSIVE: In an exclusive interview with Chuck Todd, President Donald Trump says he hadn’t given final approval to Iran strikes, no planes were in the air. pic.twitter.com/qHtTx7Zql5 — Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) June 21, 2019 Report\n\nTehran says the unmanned US aircraft entered Iranian airspace early on Thursday morning. The US maintains it was shot down in international airspace.\n\nTensions have been escalating between the two countries, with the US recently blaming Iran for attacks on oil tankers operating in the region. Iran has announced it will soon exceed international agreed limits on its nuclear programme.\n\nLast year, the US unilaterally pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear activities.\n\n\"Iran can NEVER have nuclear weapons,\" Mr Trump said in his tweets on the aborted strikes - also revealing that increased economic sanctions against Iran were \"added last night\".\n\nThe US has now asked the United Nations Security Council to meet on Monday to discuss Iran, Reuters news agency reports.\n\nWhat had been planned?\n\nIn its initial report, The New York Times said that as late as 19:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Thursday, US military and diplomatic officials had still expected the strikes to take place on agreed targets, including Iranian radar and missile batteries.\n\n\"Planes were in the air and ships were in position, but no missiles had been fired when word came to stand down,\" the newspaper reported, citing an unnamed senior administration official.\n\nBut Mr Trump refuted this report on Friday, telling NBC that no planes were in the air.\n\nThe strikes had been set to take place just before dawn on Friday to minimise risk to the Iranian military or to civilians, the New York Times report added.\n\nTweeting on Friday, Mr Trump said three sites had been targeted.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption The US military identified the drone downed on Thursday as a US Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk (file photo)\n\nThe Associated Press quoted a US official as saying the strikes had been recommended by the Pentagon and had been among options presented to senior administration officials.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, top Pentagon officials warned a military response could result in a spiralling escalation with risks for US forces in the region.\n\nThe operation was called off after President Trump spent most of Thursday discussing Iran with his national security advisers and congressional leaders, AP reports.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton had pushed for a hardline stance, but congressional leaders urged caution, the agency says.\n\nImage copyright EPA/PTV Image caption Iran released footage purportedly showing the launch of an Iranian surface-to-air missile to shoot down the US drone\n\nSeparately, Reuters quoted two Iranian officials as saying Tehran had received a message from Mr Trump through Oman overnight warning about an imminent US attack.\n\nThat report was later denied by a spokesman for Iran's national security council, who said there was no truth to it and no message was sent.\n\nWhat does Iran say?\n\nAn official warned that \"any attack against Iran will have regional and international consequences\".\n\n\"When you violate Iranian territorial space, then we defend,\" Seyed Sajjadpour, one of Iran's Deputy Foreign Ministers, told the BBC.\n\nHe also said it was clear that there were members of Donald Trump's administration who were intent on overthrowing Iran's government.\n\nWhat other reaction has there been?\n\nIn the US, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said America had no appetite for war with Iran, while the leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden, called Mr Trump's Iran strategy a \"self-inflicted disaster\".\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said a war would be a \"catastrophe with unpredictable consequences\".\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency order on Thursday evening prohibiting US airlines from operating in an overwater area of Tehran-controlled airspace nearby in response.\n\nAirlines from other countries, including Britain's British Airways, the Dutch carrier KLM, Emirates, and Qantas of Australia, have also said they will re-route their flights to avoid parts of Iran.\n\nPresident Trump's decision to order – and then abort – an attack still sends a powerful message to Tehran.\n\nThe two countries came to the brink of direct conflict. But in this complex game of signalling, just what message will the Iranian leadership receive?\n\nIt, after all, had sent a significant warning of its own by downing an unmanned US reconnaissance drone.\n\nMr Trump initially appeared to play down the incident – but then apparently came the orders for a US retaliatory strike. That was followed by a last-minute change of heart.\n\nThe danger now is that Iran receives mixed messages that convey uncertainty and lack of resolve. This might encourage some in Tehran to push back at the Americans even harder.\n\nThere appears to be no diplomatic \"off-ramp\" in this crisis.\n\nUS economic sanctions are hitting home. Tehran is under pressure. Escalation remains an ever-present danger.\n\nWhat happened with the drone?\n\nIran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) announced its air force had shot down a US \"spy\" drone on Thursday morning after the unmanned aircraft violated Iranian airspace near Kuhmobarak in the southern province of Hormozgan.\n\nIRGC commander-in-chief Maj-Gen Hossein Salami said the drone's downing was a \"clear message\" to the US that Iran's borders were \"our red line\".\n\nHowever, US military officials maintain the drone was in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz at the time.\n\nIranian officials say two warnings were issued 10 minutes before the drone was shot down.\n\nAmir Ali Hajizadeh, a high-ranking officer in the IRGC, said another military aircraft, carrying 35 passengers, had been flying close to the drone. \"We could have shot down that one too, but we did not,\" he said.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter?\n\nThe shooting down of the drone followed accusations by the US that Iran had attacked two oil tankers with mines last Thursday just outside the Strait of Hormuz, in the Gulf of Oman.",

        "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Robert Mueller: No confidence that there was no crime\n\nUS Special Counsel Robert Mueller has said charging President Donald Trump with a crime was not an option, in his first comments on the Russia inquiry.\n\nHe reiterated that his report did not exonerate the president and that legal guidelines prevent the indictment of a sitting president.\n\nMr Mueller did not rule out testifying in Congress but said he would not give information that was not in his report.\n\nReacting to the remarks, Mr Trump said: \"The case is closed! Thank you.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Nothing changes from the Mueller Report. There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2019 Report\n\nAs special counsel, Mr Mueller was tasked with investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHis 448-page report said it had not established that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to influence the election.\n\nHowever, it did detail 10 instances where Mr Trump had possibly attempted to impede the investigation.\n\nWhat did Mueller say?\n\nHis statement largely reaffirmed what was in the report released with redactions last month.\n\nHe said if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump \"clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so\".\n\nMr Mueller added that \"the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,\" in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Mueller report - in 60 seconds\n\nThe special counsel said he did not believe it was \"appropriate to speak further\" about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team's report.\n\nWith Democratic lawmakers seeking to have him testify in Congress, Mr Mueller said: \"The report is my testimony.\"\n\nHe also announced the formal closure of the special counsel office and his resignation from the justice department to return to private life.\n\n'Read my report'\n\nRobert Mueller didn't break much new ground in his eight-minute statement announcing the official end of the special counsel investigation. Instead, he highlighted in bold what he views as the key points of nearly two years of work.\n\nMr Mueller started and ended by emphasising that America during the 2016 election was under attack by malign foreign actors. He said those allegations deserve the attention of every American.\n\nIn the portion of his investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, Mr Mueller said there was \"insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy\" - hardly the complete vindication the president asserts.\n\nWhen it comes to obstruction of justice, he chipped away further at the president's defences. Mr Trump wasn't exonerated, \"charging the president\" wasn't an option. If Mr Mueller has his way, his role in this drama is at an end. His report speaks for itself, he said, and he wouldn't engage in \"conclusions or hypotheticals about the president\".\n\nThat may not be enough for Democrats in Congress, who still want to question Mr Mueller in person. If Mr Mueller is to be believed, however, all they need to know - all he will offer them - is written in the pages of his report.\n\nAnthony in full: What rare Mueller statement actually meant\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have called on Congress to act and start impeachment proceedings.\n\n\"It is up to Congress to hold this president accountable. We need to start impeachment proceedings,\" said Senator Kamala Harris, who is running for her party's 2020 presidential nomination.\n\nSenator Cory Booker, also a presidential hopeful, said: \"Congress has a legal and moral obligation to begin impeachment proceedings immediately.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why no charge of obstruction of justice? A law professor breaks down the legal questions\n\nBut House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has avoided talking about impeachment, said: \"The Congress holds sacred its constitutional responsibility to investigate and hold the President accountable for his abuse of power.\"\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said \"it falls to Congress to respond to the crimes, lies and other wrongdoings of President Trump - and we will do so.\"\n\nRepresentative Doug Collins, the top Republican at the committee, said \"relitigating... and reinvestigating the special counsel's findings will only further divide our country,\" adding that \"it is time to move on\".\n\nThe first Republican congressman to call for Mr Trump's impeachment, Representative Justin Amash, said: \"The ball is in our court, Congress.\"\n\nMeanwhile White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said: \"After two years, the Special Counsel is moving on with his life, and everyone else should do the same.\"",

This is a divided Administration'\n\nThe cache also includes diplomatic telegrams – known as 'DipTel' in Foreign Office jargon – updating Downing Street on political events in the US and providing commentary on Trump's foreign policy decisions.\n\nThey reveal details of highly sensitive negotiations over efforts to curb Iran's nuclear weapons programme, as well as the disarray surrounding the President's handling of recent attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nOne memo, sent by Sir Kim on June 22, refers to 'incoherent, chaotic' US-Iran policy, adding: 'Its unlikely that US policy on Iran is going to become more coherent any time soon. This is a divided Administration'.\n\nHe questioned Trump's recent claim that he aborted a missile strike on Iran because it would have caused a predicted 150 casualties, saying it 'doesn't stand up'.\n\n'It's more likely that he was never fully on board and that he was worried about how this apparent reversal of his 2016 campaign promises would look come 2020' – at the next Presidential election.\n\nAnother memo, sent on June 10, warns of tensions ahead over Brexit: 'As we advance our agenda of deepening and strengthening trading arrangements, divergences of approach on climate change, media freedoms and the death penalty may come to the fore.'\n\nThe leak of diplomatic cables is extremely unusual and will raise new questions about morale in the Civil Service.\n\nWhen dealing with Trump you need to make your points simple, even blunt\n\nThere is mounting evidence that Brexit has politicised many mandarins, with officials who privately support Brexit accusing the Civil Service of trying to stop the UK leaving the EU.\n\nDarroch, who became British Ambassador to Washington in January 2016, is a former UK Permanent Representative to the EU and widely regarded as a europhile.\n\nThe Foreign Office last night said that the British public 'would expect our Ambassadors to provide Ministers with an honest, unvarnished assessment of the politics in their countries'.\n\nA spokesman added: 'Their views are not necessarily the views of Ministers or indeed the Government. But we pay them to be candid, just as the US Ambassador here will send back his reading of Westminster politics and personalities.\n\n'Of course we would expect such advice to be handled by Ministers and civil servants in the right way and it's important that our Ambassadors can offer their advice and for it remain confidential.\n\n'Our team in Washington have strong relations with the White House and no doubt that these will withstand such mischievous behaviour.'\n\nTrump's speeches are 'full of false claims' and the White House 'will never look competent': Ambassador's withering views reveal scale of concern British Government has about President\n\nIt was summer 2017, and Britain's National Security Council was convening to discuss a problem. President Trump had been in office for 150 days, and Prime Minister Theresa May and her Cabinet colleagues were still struggling to get a handle on his chaotic Administration. They needed advice.\n\nAt his desk in his splendid official residence in Washington DC, the British Ambassador, Sir Kim Darroch was trying to help. Britain's National Security Adviser Sir Mark Sedwill had asked him to put together some thoughts on the President's personality and leadership style, and he was compiling a briefing note.\n\nCopied to a 'strictly limited' number of senior figures in Downing Street and the Foreign Office, it ran to six pages of highly unflattering observations about the President's character and political record.\n\nIn the confidential memo – marked 'Official Sensitive' – the UK's most important diplomat accused Trump of 'radiating insecurity', filling his speeches with 'false claims and invented statistics' and achieving 'almost nothing' in terms of domestic policy.\n\nEarlier, Sedwill had sent Sir Kim an outline presentation for the meeting. Sir Kim thought the slides 'looked good'. There was just one point he felt he needed to correct: 'My only disagreement with the slides: I don't think this Administration will ever look competent,' he declared.\n\nIt was an extraordinarily damning assessment. The problem was that Ministers and diplomats had to find a way to deal with the President.\n\nSir Kim highlighted how America was still the UK's No 1 security partner and the 'cultural and historical ties' between the two countries were 'profound'. The UK needed America: as an export market; for defence and intelligence cooperation; and for a post-Brexit trade deal.\n\n'The starting point is that this is our single most important bilateral relationship,' Sir Kim wrote.\n\nBut he added: 'As seen from here, we really don't believe that this Administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional, less unpredictable, less faction-riven, less diplomatically clumsy and inept.'\n\nThere's no upside in being subtle, let alone being ambiguous\n\nHe therefore compiled a three-point guide for how Britain's politicians and officials should handle this most unpredictable of Presidents. His first suggestion was to 'flood the zone', which meant influencing as many of the President's key advisers as possible.\n\nSir Kim said Trump spends his days in the Oval Office asking his White House team, Cabinet members and senior Republicans for their opinions 'on the business of the moment'.\n\nBut, crucially, the diplomat also highlighted how the President spends his evenings phoning his friends outside the administration 'seeking reinforcement or a different take'. Many of these friends have been 'cultivated' by the British, Sir Kim boasted.\n\n'It's important to 'flood the zone': you want as many as possible of those who Trump consults to give him the same answer,' he wrote. 'So we need to be creative in using all the channels available to us through our relationships with his Cabinet, the White House staff, and our contacts among his outside friends.'\n\nSir Kim's second recommendation was for Theresa May to call Trump more often, stressing 'there is no consistently reliable substitute for the personal phone call from the Prime Minister'.\n\nSir Kim said Trump spends his days in the Oval Office asking his White House team, Cabinet members and senior Republicans for their opinions 'on the business of the moment'\n\n'The President respects and likes her,' he added. 'I know they have already talked several times. But in a perfect world, they would be speaking two or three times a month, if not more.'\n\nThe diplomat's third pointer was to urge Britain's politicians and officials to use flattery and to pander to the President's ego when they come into contact with him.\n\n'You need to start praising him for something that he's done recently,' he advised. 'You need whenever possible to present them as wins for him.' In comments which could be viewed as highly patronising, Sir Kim also advised his bosses to make their points 'simple' and 'even blunt', adding: 'as a senior White House adviser told me, there is no upside with this President in being subtle, let alone ambiguous.'\n\nHis stark assessment reveals the scale of concern at the highest level in the British Government about Trump. By summer 2017, the President had torn up the Paris climate change accord; junked key international trade agreements and launched military strikes against Syria. Western allies were reeling: he didn't seem to care who he upset.\n\nYou need to start by praising him for something he's done recently\n\nBut while Trump was making waves on the world stage, his domestic programme was getting nowhere, Sir Kim said.\n\nThe President's big election pledges – building a wall between the US and Mexico; stopping Muslims from certain countries coming to America and reforming tax and healthcare – had all hit the buffers.\n\n'Of the main campaign promises, not an inch of the Wall has been built; the executive orders on travel bans from Muslim countries have been blocked by the state courts; tax reform and the infrastructure package have been pushed into the middle distance; and the repeal and replacement of Obamacare is on a knife edge,' Sir Kim wrote. The Ambassador 'wouldn't bet a tenner' on Trump's health proposals passing through the Senate.\n\nSir Kim's confidential letter, sent to Sedwill, who is now also the Cabinet Secretary, on June 22, 2017, is unsparing in its assessment of the President's personality flaws and the chaos of his administration.\n\nIn language that is likely to prove highly embarrassing for Sir Kim, the Ambassador declared: 'For a man who has risen to the highest office on the planet, President Trump radiates insecurity.'\n\nHe highlighted how the Administration had been 'dogged from day one by stories of vicious infighting and chaos inside the White House, and swamped by scandals – all, one way or another, linked to Russia.'\n\nAnd while the President would deride media stories about such chaos as 'fake news', Sir Kim privately advised his bosses in London to believe what they were reading in the newspapers. 'The stories about White House knife fights are, we judge, mostly true: multiple sources and confirmed by our own White House contacts. This is a uniquely dysfunctional environment.' He warned Whitehall to be braced for more presidential outbursts including the use of 'immoderate, sometimes offensive, language', like his attacks on London Mayor Sadiq Khan.\n\n'There is no filter,' Darroch advised. 'And we could also be at the beginning of a downward spiral, rather than just a rollercoaster: something could emerge that leads to disgrace and downfall.'\n\nBut while warning Whitehall that Trump's White House could collapse under the weight of scandal, he also urged the British Government not to write Trump off.\n\nThe President, he noted, has been mired in scandal most of his life but has always survived.\n\nSir Kim drew a parallel with The Terminator, a 1984 science fiction film featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cyborg that is almost impossible to destroy.\n\n'Trump may emerge from the flames, battered but intact, like Schwarzenegger in the final scenes of The Terminator.'\n\nLooking to the future, Sir Kim warned 'there are real risks on the horizon' and that Trump 'will do or say things we oppose'.\n\n'This 'America First' Administration could do some profoundly damaging things to the world trade system: such as denounce the WTO, tear up existing trade details, launch protectionist action, even against allies. It could further undermine international action on climate change, or further cut UN funding.' He said that Trump's 'spontaneous' missile strike on a Syrian airbase in April 2017 had won him 'the best headlines of his brief time in the Oval Office' but warned that 'a less well judged military intervention is not inconceivable.'\n\nIn the face of the chaos, Sir Kim highlighted how German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and French President Emmanuel Macron, were busy distancing themselves from Trump. But Sir Kim warned London: 'I don't think we should follow them.'\n\nHe admitted it could be rocky, but suggested that sometimes it might make sense to criticise the President, 'provided we are careful'. Sir Kim added: 'Arguably, you get more respect from this President if you stand up to him occasionally – provided the public comments do not come as a surprise and are judicious, calm and avoid personalising.'\n\nToday he may regret that his confidential memo does not meet that test.\n\nIndeed, last night, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, a friend of the President, called for Sir Kim to leave his post, saying: 'The sooner he is gone the better.'\n\nThe council house kid who ended up with a plum job: How Sir Kim Darroch secured a prestige position by winning scholarship to £20,000 private school before taking Foreign Office role because 'they were the first to offer him work'\n\nSir Kim Darroch's gilded lifestyle, meeting the great and the good at Britain's lavish Ambassador's residence in Washington DC, is a world away from the council flat he grew up in.\n\nHis parents split up when he was just six years old, forcing his family to leave behind their hitherto comfortable life in Nairobi, Kenya, where his father taught in a private school.\n\nHis mother Edna moved Kim and his younger brother back to Britain and into a flat on a council estate in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.\n\nFrom there, many boys would have gone on to work in manual employment. But Kim, a bright student, had other ideas.\n\nAfter soaring through the entrance exams, he won a free scholarship to attend Abingdon School, a leading public school that charges £20,000 a year for day pupils.\n\nAfter soaring through the entrance exams, he won a free scholarship to attend Abingdon School (pictured), a leading public school that charges £20,000 a year for day pupils\n\n'I think I was the only person in the school uniform walking out of this council estate every morning to go to school,' he recalled in a recent interview.\n\n'I think what it teaches you is that all things are possible no matter where you come from, if you put the work in.'\n\nAfter finishing his A-levels, he studied zoology at Durham University because – in his own words – he was 'naturally lazy' and it was an 'easier option'.\n\nHe joined the Foreign Office in 1977 after graduating because 'they were the first people to offer me a job' and started his ascent through the ranks at Embassies around the world, including top roles dealing with EU bureaucrats in Brussels.\n\nWhen he landed the most prestigious diplomatic post in the Foreign Office – British Ambassador to the United States – in 2016, Barack Obama was winding down his presidency. Sir Kim and his wife Vanessa, who he married in 1978, soon settled into the comfortable private apartment in the Embassy, widely regarded as the finest in Washington DC.\n\nIt has a ballroom, boutique hotel-style guest rooms, a library and beautiful gardens. It was his reward for 40 years in the Civil Service, and he threw himself into the social whirl. The residence hosts almost 800 breakfasts, lunches, dinners and cocktail parties a year, and Sir Kim reportedly shows up at 90 per cent of them.\n\nHis job was relatively straightforward – until Donald Trump arrived.\n\nDays after winning the Presidential election in November 2016, Trump was tweeting that he'd prefer his friend Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, to be Britain's Ambassador to the US.\n\nDays after winning the Presidential election in November 2016, Trump was tweeting that he'd prefer his friend Nigel Farage (pictured with Trump in August 2016), the former Ukip leader, to be Britain's Ambassador to the US\n\nNo 10 insisted it was for Britain to decide who serves as its Ambassador, while Sir Kim bit his tongue. But it's clear Trump created unprecedented challenges even for this most experienced of diplomats.\n\nThere is no doubting Sir Kim's deep patriotism (his mobile phone cover is a Union Jack) and colleagues in the Foreign Office consider him to be a first rate diplomat. However, it is his long postings in Brussels that have earned him a reputation as a europhile, and he is mistrusted by Brexiteers.\n\nHe was Tony Blair's top Europe adviser from 2004 to 2007 and then became Britain's Permanent Representative to the EU from 2007 and 2011.\n\nKnighted in 2008, he became David Cameron's National Security Advisor, from January 2012 to September 2015, before his Washington posting.\n\nNow aged 65, Darroch is nearing the end of his diplomatic career.\n\nEven before today's revelations in The Mail on Sunday, few expected him to survive in Washington DC after the next UK Prime Minister takes office.\n\nNow these unfortunate leaks may just hasten his departure.\n\nBut Ambassador STILL says The Donald can win again!\n\nDonald Trump could win a second term in the White House, Sir Kim Darroch told Downing Street, saying there is a 'credible path' for him to sweep to victory in next year's Presidential election.\n\nIn a leaked diplomatic cable sent on June 20, the Ambassador reported how two days earlier the President had 'electrified' an audience of 20,000 supporters in Orlando, Florida, at a huge rally to launch his re-election campaign.\n\nA senior British diplomat was in the Amway Center, an indoor sports stadium, to witness the event and report back to Sir Kim.\n\nIn a leaked diplomatic cable sent on June 20, the Ambassador reported how two days earlier the President had 'electrified' an audience of 20,000 supporters in Orlando, Florida, at a huge rally to launch his re-election campaign (pictured)\n\nThe Ambassador told London that while the President had not offered any new policies, 'the crowd could not have been happier'.\n\n'The atmosphere was unique – somewhere between a major sporting event (where only the home team fans are in the crowd) and a mega-church. Indeed the event kicked off with prayers from a pastor who asked God to 'tear down' opposition to the President.'\n\nSir Kim said the audience was a 'sea of the now iconic red MAGA [Make American Great Again] caps. The crowd looked almost exclusively white, with a pretty even mix of men and women, young and old: there were families in every stand. For some, attending had meant a long wait in 30C heat and humidity.'\n\nSir Kim said the audience was a 'sea of the now iconic red MAGA [Make American Great Again] caps. The crowd looked almost exclusively white, with a pretty even mix of men and women, young and old: there were families in every stand. For some, attending had meant a long wait in 30C heat and humidity'\n\nSir Kim predicted that the President's campaign strategy will be to 'go with what he knows best' and appeal to his core supporters.\n\nHe noted how the enthusiasm of his 'die-hard fans' is undiminished after two-and-a-half years in the Oval Office. In comments that could anger the White House, Sir Kim reported that: 'As is standard at these rallies, the language was incendiary, and a mix of fact and fiction – hard to reconcile with [Vice President Mike] Pence's remarks about governing for all Americans.'\n\nA key difference between when Trump last ran for President in 2016 is that the machinery of the Republican Party is 'four-square behind him', Sir Kim said.\n\nSir Kim said the President still faces hurdles – including the prospect of the Democrats picking a candidate more popular than the widely disliked Hillary Clinton, who fought the last election.\n\nHe also said Trump cannot afford to lose much support and stressed that the President has made no meaningful efforts to 'diversify his base'.\n\n'All that said, there is still a credible path for Trump – but so much rides on who the Democrats choose in July 2020.'\n\nHow Trump told British Ambassador the special relationship felt 'closer and stronger' after state visit but warned 'don't expect any special favours'\n\nAs the President and First Lady boarded Air Force One at Southampton, Sir Kim Darroch breathed a sigh of relief. Their State visit to the UK was finally over and, despite minor hiccups, it had been a resounding success.\n\nMoments earlier, on the Tarmac, Donald Trump had taken his leave of the various UK Government officials and dignitaries who had gathered to see him off.\n\nThe formalities – six months in the planning – were now over. All that remained was for Sir Kim, who had accompanied the President throughout the three-day trip, to bid him farewell. 'This was a wonderful visit, and UK-US relations are now in the best state ever,' Trump told him, shaking his hand.\n\nAs the President and First Lady boarded Air Force One at Southampton, Sir Kim Darroch breathed a sigh of relief. Their State visit to the UK (pictured with the Queen in Buckingham Palace for the State Banquet) was finally over and, despite minor hiccups, it had been a resounding success\n\nThe British Ambassador to Washington could hardly hide his delight.\n\nSomehow he had managed to pull off what had, at times, looked an almost impossible feat: showing America's First Family the very best of British pomp and circumstance and steering him through multiple potentially tricky meetings and engagements, without any unwelcome drama. It was the pinnacle of his 40-year career in the Civil Service.\n\nIran: His missile attack u-turn claim 'doesn't stand up' American policy towards Iran is incoherent and unlikely to improve 'any time soon', according to a devastating memo by Sir Kim Darroch. In a damning indictment of Donald Trump's administration, Britain's Ambassador to Washington described '36 hours of contradictory messaging and decisions' after Iran shot down a US military drone last month. The missile strike by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard took America to the brink of launching a retaliatory attack. But after authorising a strike and boasting of being 'cocked and loaded', President Trump aborted the mission with ten minutes to spare after being told that it might kill as many as 150 people. Blame: The US says Iran attacked this oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman in June Tensions have been escalating between the US and Iran since May 2018, when Trump announced the US was withdrawing from a nuclear agreement with Iran and was reimposing sanctions on the regime. The US has blamed Iran for a series of recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. In his memo, written at 12.39am UK time on June 22, Sir Kim described disarray and confusion across Washington as Trump unexpectedly aborted the attack. 'The Administration said nothing for several hours, awaiting guidance from the White House,' he wrote. 'Even our best contacts were unwilling to take our calls.' Sir Kim said the episode illustrated Trump's 'aversion to new military adventures'. But, astonishingly, he made it clear to London that he did not believe the President's explanation of why he cancelled the attack. 'His claim, however, that he changed his mind because of 150 predicted casualties doesn't stand up; he would certainly have heard this figure in his initial briefing. 'It's more likely that he was never fully on board and that he was worried about how this apparent reversal of his 2016 campaign promises would look come 2020 [at the next election].' He warned that this is a 'divided Administration' and that 'it's unlikely that US policy on Iran is going to become more coherent anytime soon'. And while Trump had stepped back from the brink this time, Sir Kim warned that the President could still trigger a conflict with Iran, noting that he is now 'surrounded by a more hawkish group of advisers'. 'This may, however, only be a temporary pause,' he warned. 'Just one more Iranian attack somewhere in the region could trigger yet another Trump U-turn. Moreover, the loss of a single American life would probably make a critical difference.'\n\nBack at his desk in Washington, almost two weeks later, Sir Kim was still buzzing. He settled down to write a long memo to Prime Minister Theresa May and other senior Government figures reflecting on what had been achieved.\n\n'We are basking in a big success, with doors open everywhere in Washington,' he gushed in a diplomatic cable sent last month and marked 'Official Sensitive'. 'As a result, our relationship with this Administration, at this critical juncture for the UK, feels closer and stronger.'\n\nBut he warned London not to get too carried away, stressing that this was 'still an Administration of 'no special favours'.'\n\n'We might be flavour of the month, but this is still the land of 'America First',' he concluded.\n\nSir Kim could be forgiven for feeling pleased with himself. The smooth running of what was only the third State visit of a US President to the UK (the others were George W Bush and Barack Obama) had been by no means assured.\n\nIndeed, the President had barely entered UK airspace before there were signs of trouble.\n\nMoments before touching down in London, he had fired off a characteristically aggressive tweet about the city's mayor Sadiq Khan, labelling the Labour politician a 'stone cold loser' and making a disparaging comment about his height.\n\nIt was hardly the diplomatic start Sir Kim had hoped for. If the President continued to behave like this, the visit would be a disaster.\n\nFor all the President's bombast, Sir Kim knew he was nervous. He was excited about seeing the Queen again – they had met for the first time almost exactly a year earlier – but had been fretting about messing up.\n\nLast time, he had been accused of various gaffes, and he was 'worried about getting the protocol right', Sir Kim later reported.\n\nThe Ambassador knew that Her Majesty would take any minor slips in her stride. He was much more concerned about the President meeting Prince Charles.\n\nThe President and the heir to the throne did not see eye-to-eye over the environment. What if they had some embarrassing row?\n\nThen there was the diplomatic minefield posed by the looming Tory Party leadership contest. Mrs May was on her way out, and the President would have to decide which of the dozen or so MPs vying for her job he should take time to meet. What if he backed the wrong horse?\n\nFurthermore, there were difficult discussions looming over Chinese telecoms giant Huawei. The President was annoyed by the UK's refusal to cut ties with the company. It could be awkward.\n\nGreatly to Sir Kim's relief, however, everything went to plan.\n\nFrom his splendid official residence on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington DC – once described as 'Downton Abbey on the Potomac' – Sir Kim reflected on what had been achieved.\n\nHe penned a long diplomatic telegram on June 17 on the 'impressions and implications' of the State visit. The memo was sent at 2.15am, UK time, guaranteeing that it would be read at the beginning of the working day in London.\n\n'With this unorthodox President, there were genuine risks… In the event, the gamble paid [off] handsomely,' he wrote in the cable that was sent to No 10 and senior officials across Whitehall.\n\nThough Trump was now 'used to being feted by foreign governments,' the State visit was 'an honour that no other country can match' and Trump had 'revelled in every element of it'.\n\n'The President knew from the outset that it amounted to genuinely special treatment…. Although initially worried about getting the protocol right, he became more relaxed as it progressed; and by the end, he could not have been happier or more fulsome in his assessment,' Sir Kim wrote in the telegram.\n\nAccording to the Ambassador, the highlight for the President had been the 'extensive personal engagement' with the Queen: at a private lunch, at a glittering State banquet, and at the D-Day commemorations in Portsmouth.\n\nCordial: Trump hit it off with Charles - surprisingly. Trump 'seemed to deeply appreciate' the effort the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall made. 'I think the Prince of Wales, despite differing views on climate change, established an open and easy relationship with the President,' he wrote\n\nHowever, he had also got on surprisingly well with Charles and Camilla. Trump 'seemed to deeply appreciate' the effort the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall made. 'I think the Prince of Wales, despite differing views on climate change, established an open and easy relationship with the President,' he wrote.\n\nThroughout the visit, Sir Kim had also been conscious of the need to keep Trump's aides happy. The President had travelled with a huge entourage, all of whom needed to be looked after. That had gone equally well.\n\n'His team were also dazzled, telling us that this had been a visit like no other – the hottest ticket of their careers,' he reported.\n\nRussia: The presidency could crash and burn over Russia links Donald Trump's alleged links to Russia could see his presidency 'crashing and burning', Ambassador Darroch said in one memo. In a controversial briefing note written two years ago, Sir Kim Darroch warned his bosses in London that of all the President's troubles, allegations of collusion between the Trump camp and Russia – since largely disproved – had the greatest potential to finish him. At the time, evidence was mounting that his campaign team had conspired with Vladimir Putin's regime to beat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. There were also unproven claims his son-in-law Jared Kushner may have been indebted to shady Russian moneymen. The British Ambassador feared they might be true. 'The worst cannot be ruled out,' he said, in a letter written for the UK's National Security Adviser Sir Mark Sedwill in June 2017 marked 'Official Sensitive'. 'There could have been active collusion between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence, especially over the timing of release of hacked emails from inside the Clinton camp. Dodgy Russian financiers may have bailed out the Trump and Kushner enterprises when both were at risk of bankruptcy in previous decades,' he declared. A month earlier, in May 2017, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller had launched an investigation. Trump was accused of trying to stop a probe into his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Once again, Sir Kim was uneasy. 'Trump's attempts to close down the FBI investigation... might amount to obstruction of justice,' he said. This would be a criminal offence. He warned Sedwill that Trump could win a second term, but 'we can't rule out his crashing and burning either'. For all his misgivings, Sir Kim also told Sedwill he 'wouldn't bet' on any of it bringing the President down. 'Trump has been mired in scandal pretty much all his life, and has come through it. He seems indestructible,' he wrote.\n\nImpressing Trump's advisers was far more than a matter of manners.\n\nCultivating contacts in the White House and Trump administration was a key part of Sir Kim's job. He liked to call those with the President's ear the 'Trump Whisperers.' Now he was on even better terms with them.\n\n'These are close contacts, with whom we have spent years building relationships: they are the gatekeepers... the individuals we rely upon to ensure the UK voice is heard in the West Wing.\n\n'The visit will make a substantial difference to those relationships too,' he enthused.\n\nOn their return to the US, Sir Kim and his team had 'done the rounds with journalists, pundits and commentators'. Media coverage had been great.\n\n'With some nuances, their view was that we had pulled off a difficult task: a largely gaffe-free visit which had made a President who often stumbled on foreign trips look good, and which had shown the UK, at a difficult juncture, at its best,' Sir Kim declared.\n\nMercifully little had been made of 'potentially controversial moments' like public protests, the spat with Khan, and 'private meetings with some prominent UK politicians', including Nigel Farage.\n\nInstead, American journalists had focused on 'how much the President appeared to be enjoying himself; how relaxed a relationship he appeared to have developed with the Queen; and how well the talks and lunch with the Prime Minister appear to have gone', Sir Kim wrote.\n\nNow it was a question of capitalising on these gains. The Ambassador told his bosses back home that he would be building on the 'enhanced personal relationship with the Trump inner circle to deliver UK objectives'. Thinking ahead, he felt that the State visit could be used to lay the ground for Theresa May's successor – Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt – to secure an early meeting with the President.\n\nThe new Prime Minister would be 'starting in the best possible place with this President', he said.\n\nHe suggested a possible early meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York in mid-September ('though Brexit considerations may intrude here') or 'in the margins of the Nato summit in December'.\n\nBut the new Prime Minister could also make a formal visit to the White House.\n\n'I am sure that there would be a warm welcome here in Washington if that's what we want to happen,' Sir Kim said.\n\nBut perhaps conscious that his report might sound too self-congratulatory, Sir Kim signed off with a warning that despite the successful visit, America would not cut the UK any slack in trade negotiations and would continue to press the UK to 'choose between them and China'.\n\nThey would measure the UK by 'what resources we bring to the table', he cautioned.",
