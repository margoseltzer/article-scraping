        "text": "·\nIf you want to watch a conservative throw a temper tantrum just mention slavery and grab your popcorn.\nBecause when First Lady Michelle Obama talked about slavery and the great progress our country has made since the Civil War during an interview at the new Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, conservatives took to Twitter to whine.\nMrs. Obama told Good Morning America host Robin Roberts about how she feels about visiting the museum, which opens this weekend. And one of the things that struck her the most is the fact that a lot of the history the museum presents happened during the lives of the three generations of her family who visited the museum that day. And she expressed astonishment at how fast progress has been made.\n“When you think about the fact that my great-great grandfather was a slave and today I live in the White House, that progress is huge and it’s fast,” the First Lady said.\nHere’s the video via Twitter.\nFLOTUS: “My great-great grandfather was a slave and today I live in the White House. That progress is huge.” https://t.co/A4RwUHYR5z pic.twitter.com/vvhgrtxoYu\nBut, of course, conservatives lost their shit and displayed their hatred in the comments.\n@ABC And the sooner that Mooch and Obummer get out of the White house and Trump gets in, the better! #TrumpPence16 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\n@ABC But, you keep the narrative going that all white people, except Clintons, are racist.\n@ABC The country is more racist than ever since The Obamas entered the White House. They have a bitter resentment for White People\n@ABC So why are the democrats trying to send race relations back to the sixties?\n@ABC Keep driving racial segregation down our throats, ABC. These types of post should sure give you more “peaceful” protest to cover.\n@ABC MOVE OUT BIMBO\n@ABC Lord Jesus said to do good as bondmen.\n@ABC And we can thank the Republican Party for that. It certainly wasn’t the Democrats.\n@ABC then they managed to set us back decades by generating a racial divide n bringing anarchy among the people… awesome job NOT #GOTRUMP\nAnd while it is true that the early Republican Party freed the slaves, it was at a time when Republicans were liberals and Democrats were conservatives. The two parties have flipped since then. Democrats have since become the defenders of Civil Rights who continue to fight for racial equality and social justice while Republicans pandered to white racists in the South and have become dominated by white supremacists who desperately want to roll back any and all progress African-Americans have made in this country.\nIf Republicans have to go back 150 years to find one good thing the party did for African-Americans that’s really embarrassing and says a lot about what the party has become.\nFeatured image via  Wikimedia\n",
