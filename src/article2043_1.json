Mr Weinstein has begun counselling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.\"\nMeanwhile, actress Lindsay Lohan posted an Instagram story - which she later deleted - appearing to defend Weinstein, saying: \"I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now. I don't think it's right what's going on.\"\nBuzzfeed reporter Lauren Yap did a screen grab and posted Lohan's video , in which she also posted an angel emoji under Weinstein's name, on Twitter. Lohan also said Chapman should \"be there for her husband\" - although it's not clear if she knew at the time that Chapman had said she was leaving him.\nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents .
