        "text": "It was October 31, a balmy day in Brooklyn, and Alexander Arroyo was walking around his neighborhood dressed as an octopus, pushing his 2-month-old daughter in a carriage, as his wife chased their toddler through the after-school Halloween trick-or-treat crowd. As the family filled their bags with candy, Arroyo’s phone rang and he stopped to answer it, trying to hear over the din of excited children. Arroyo is the director of the pediatric emergency department at one of the biggest hospitals in Brooklyn, Maimonides Medical Center, and two days earlier, a 15-month-old girl had come to the ER with a fever and a rash. He’d been waiting for a call to confirm the diagnosis, and this was it. The test had come back positive: The girl had measles. When the girl had arrived at the ER, she was put in a busy area, where children with earaches or broken arms typically sit. No one suspected measles, because, thanks to routine childhood vaccination, the disease was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000. Although there had been localized outbreaks since then—among the Amish in Ohio, visitors to Disneyland in California, and the Somali American community in Minnesota—neither Arroyo nor most of his staff had seen a case firsthand. Suspecting ­measles was like thinking “maybe that’s a unicorn,” Arroyo says. “It doesn’t really cross your mind, because measles shouldn’t exist anymore.” Still, several measles cases had been reported in a different part of Brooklyn. And after a few hours, Arroyo’s team began to worry that the child in their care might be another. They put a mask over her face and wheeled her into an isolation room, with two sets of doors and air circulating under negative pressure to prevent airborne particles from escaping. By then, however, “the bomb had gone off,” Arroyo says. Measles is considered one of the most contagious diseases in existence. If a person with measles walks through a room with a hundred people who are not immunized, up to 90 of them will get the disease. The virus is spread through coughs and sneezes and lingers in the air for up to two hours. Some 122,000 ­people come through the Maimonides emergency room every year. The hospital, located in Borough Park, serves one of the most diverse patient populations in the country, from ultra-Orthodox Jews to immigrants whose first language might be Mandarin, Russian, Hindi, Punjabi, Arabic, or Uzbek. Many are working-class cab drivers, manual laborers, and restaurant workers who bring their children to the ER at night, when their shifts are done. Dr. Alexander Arroyo in the waiting room of Maimonides Medical Center. Natalie Keyssar Standing in the street that Halloween, Arroyo thought about the dozens of patients who might have been exposed—in the waiting room, the hallway, the exam rooms—from the time the girl came into the hospital until she was placed in isolation. He looked down at his daughter in the carriage, dressed as a clown fish, and thought, “She’s not vaccinated.” She was still too young, as were other babies who might have been in the ER. He knew that his team would have to figure out right away who, exactly, had been breathing the same air as the infected girl. He waved down his wife, who had been making her way down the street with their toddler, and asked her to take the baby carriage. Then he headed home to make phone calls. “I saw my life falling into a pit of measles,” he says. Arroyo is an amateur kickboxer, lanky and athletic. He hurried down the street, talking by phone with the hospital’s infection-control nurse and mapping out a plan. At home he changed out of the octopus costume and logged on to the hospital’s electronic medical records to check what time, exactly, the girl with measles had entered the ER. He called the other doctors who had been on duty to see if they remembered any pregnant mothers or immunocompromised children who would have been especially at risk. He also called the hospital’s IT department to help backtrack through medical charts. His team generated names of 55 children who had potentially been exposed to the disease, then asked the New York City Department of Health to cross-reference it with vaccination records. For the MMR vaccine (against measles, mumps, and rubella) to be effective, the immune system has to be mature enough to produce antibodies to the virus. Young babies’ immune systems are not sufficiently developed, so children generally receive an MMR vaccine at 1 year old and another at age 4 or 5; those who had come through the hospital but had not completed both doses were considered at risk. On the Maimonides list were a 12-month-old, a 10-month-old, and three babies younger than 6 months, including one who was just 17 days old. All were vulnerable, and Arroyo realized he was already running out of time. To prevent infection, the children needed to receive MMR shots within 72 hours, and young babies would have to be given immunoglobulin, a form of temporary protection, within six days. The infection-control nurse began making calls to those babies’ parents. Related Stories How Measles Hacks the Body—and Harms Its Victims for Years\n\nMeasles Had Been Eliminated. Now It’s Nearly a Daily Threat\n\nCalifornia’s Vaccination Rate Slips as Medical Exemptions Rise When the combined MMR vaccine was first introduced, in 1971, it was regarded as a triumph of science and public health. In 1998, however, physician Andrew Wakefield published a now infamous paper in the medical journal The Lancet that purported to show a connection between MMR and symptoms of autism. Though the results were soundly refuted and the journal retracted the paper—and Wakefield lost his license to practice medicine—his claims burrowed deep among small clusters: celebrities and others who had children on the autism spectrum and those suspicious of traditional medicine and pharmaceutical companies. Some of those antivax activists went deep into conspiracy, saying that vaccines contained contaminants and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was engaged in a sinister cover-up. When tech platforms like Facebook and YouTube came along, they amplified the antivax message in all its forms. The notion that vaccines could be dangerous also jumped from these sources to ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn, where the ideas spread mostly through the analog form of phone hotlines and pamphlets. By 2018, while the vast majority of parents in these communities still vaccinated their children, enough were scared off that the misinformation landed a blow—as New York City hospitals like Maimonides suddenly discovered. Arroyo’s team managed to reach and give preventive treatment to just about all the vulnerable children exposed to measles that late October day. But he’d barely caught his breath when, in mid-November, another infant with fever and a rash arrived by ambulance at Maimonides. Another child with a case of suspected measles—this one a toddler—arrived moments later through a different entrance. By that time, the infant had been sequestered in the lone negative-pressure room. The infant later tested negative for measles, while the toddler tested positive. It was unfortunate timing, and scores of patients were exposed to infected air. The hospital team began making calls again. Children returned for shots, and their parents were instructed to keep them home for 28 days. The nurse who greeted patients near the registration desk kept watch for those with fever and a rash who needed immediate isolation, and Arroyo rushed repeatedly to the intake area to look at worrisome rashes. As the fall wore on, the cases kept coming. In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, signs of concern. Natalie Keyssar\n\nChany has spent most of her life in Borough Park, not far from Maimonides. She has a youthful face, with bright green eyes and a tentative smile. When we met at a café near her home, she was wearing a wig, as married women in her ultra-­Orthodox community do, and was modestly dressed in a black skirt and long sleeves, with a black-and-white-striped duster on top. We’d been talking by phone for more than a month about the course her life had taken, from compliant patient to activist. She greeted me with a hug but then seemed to become wary. When Chany married and began having children in the 1990s, she took them to a pediatric practice and saw no reason to question the physicians’ recommendations. Her first three children received their vaccines on schedule. “I was open to the doctors, like a nice little girl,” she said. “Whatever they said, I did.” Yet as her children grew, Chany noticed problems, which she believes “should have been a red flag.” The first child had recurrent ear infections. When the third child was about a year and a half, Chany’s father said to her, “I don’t think he hears.” The boy was later diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum. Chany, whose last name WIRED agreed not to publish, had heard the idea that vaccines could cause injuries, but she hadn’t given it much thought. Now a glimmer of doubt entered her mind. When her fourth child was old enough to receive an MMR, she expressed her nervousness about vaccines to the doctor. She says he brushed her off, saying only that the shot was safe and effective. Chany felt dismissed, then disappointed with herself for allowing the child to be vaccinated. “Why can’t I tell him I don’t want this right now?” she thought. “Why can’t I stand up for myself?” Chany had hoped to go to college and become a speech therapist. By the time her husband finished his degree, though, she was consumed with the demands of a growing family. Now she turned what time and energy she had toward reading up on immunization. Searching online for books, she landed on one by Sherri Tenpenny, an Ohio physician who claimed that vaccines are linked to autism. One anti­vax source led to another. Chany began printing out lists of vaccine ingredients from the CDC, browsing the internet, and watching videos. She was drawn to videos by Andrew Moulden, a Canadian neuroscientist who claimed that vaccines cause autism by triggering oxygen deprivation or “mini strokes” in the brain. “His information really opened it up for me,” Chany says. She now felt certain that her third child’s speech and hearing delays had worsened after he started getting vaccines. She reached out to a well-known vaccine skeptic named Mayer Eisenstein. Unlike her own pediatrician, Eisenstein listened sympathetically to her concerns and even gave her his cell phone number. By the time Chany’s fifth child was due to receive shots, she was firm in her convictions. She believed vaccination had caused her children’s disabilities. “I realized it was my mistake,” she says. “And if I made a mistake, I’m going to have to fix it.” Chany decided to create a forum for women in her community. “No one likes to be alone,” she says. “If your child just got a vaccine and now he doesn’t speak anymore, your doctor’s not going to answer that.” Since some Hasidic sects frown on internet use, ultra-­Orthodox women often receive community news, inspirational talks, and other information by way of the phone. Chany worked with others who set up a hotline called Akeres Habayis, or Woman of the House, so that she could use it to share information. “Mothers can feel when something’s wrong with a child,” she told me, “and you should listen to their feelings and not disrespect them.” Viral Relapse In 2000 the US said measles was gone—defeated!—within its borders. Except, not quite. Cases still broke out sporadically. Now the country is in the midst of its worst outbreak in more than 20 years. From January 1 to June 13 of this year, 1,044 people, mostly children, in 28 states have been sickened with the disease. So how was measles declared eliminated, and does the current outbreak mean it’s back for good? The answer is more complicated than you might think. —Megan Molteni What does elimination mean?\n\nThe word elimination sounds absolute. But when it comes to measles, it does not mean the US has zero cases. It means no current strains are native to the US. But the virus can still be carried in from another country. Elimination, a history\n\nIn March 2000, a panel of experts convened by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention met to discuss the state of measles. They agreed that the few hundred cases over the previous three years could be attributed mostly to people carrying strains in from other countries. But they disagreed about whether to use the e word. Many worried that such a declaration would instill a false sense of security and unravel a three-decade-long vaccination campaign. In the end, they took the plunge, hoping to set an example. Sixteen years later, the World Health Organization triumphantly declared the Americas—35 countries and 12 territories—the first region to eliminate measles. The rest of the world committed to accomplishing the same goal by 2020. But in an interconnected world, disease elimination is a fragile concept. The first to fall\n\nA country loses its WHO elimination status if a single strain of the measles virus persists for 12 months or longer within its borders. For Venezuela, beset by dire political and economic turmoil, that Rubicon was crossed in July 2017. The next year, as the health system crumbled, a measles epidemic sickened 5,475 people and killed 74. Will the US be next?\n\nThe CDC tracks all measles virus strains that come into the US. Currently, the strain that has circulated the longest is D8, the one that ignited ongoing outbreaks in Brooklyn and Rockland County, New York. It has been spreading since September 2018, which means health authorities have just a few months to halt transmissions before measles would be considered officially reestab­lished. If the US loses its elimination status, it won’t be due to economic chaos or a lack of resources; it will be because viral misinformation proved harder to contain than the virus itself. This sense of being disrespected and dismissed by doctors fueled Chany’s distrust of vaccines, but her suspicion of medical authorities may have had deeper roots. Two of her grandparents were survivors of Auschwitz. The other two lived in Romania under communist rule, where they were subjected to physical violence, before coming to Brooklyn in the 1960s. Torture, medical experimentation, and death by government edict seemed an inescapable part of Chany’s inheritance, and it was one she shared with members of her community. She viewed efforts by secular health departments to mandate vaccination as a threatening intrusion on private life. Chany began to host conference calls, later posted on Akeres Habayis. She began inviting guest speakers, including well-known vaccine skeptics. One of her first guests was Mayer Eisenstein, and 47 people called in. Some of the most popular calls drew several hundred women to live conversations, with a thousand or more dialing in later to listen to the recordings. Chany got to know a wide range of antivaxxers who had risen to prominence on the internet but had not yet found a foothold among the ultra-Orthodox. The hotline made her a powerful conduit of misinformation into a world that often shunned outsiders. As Chany cultivated ties with other like-minded ­people in her community, she came up with an informal name for the network: Peach (Parents Educating and Advocating for Children’s Health). “It was just a name,” she says. “It was a way to identify people who were in the same situation.” Around 2012 or 2013, a man named Moishe Kahan reached out to her about collaborating. Kahan lived in Williamsburg, another Brooklyn neighborhood with a large ultra-­Orthodox community. Kahan had grown up in London and hadn’t had vaccines as a child. Over time he became fiercely resistant to the very idea of them. Kahan developed a presence on Facebook, promoting conspiracy theories from sources like Infowars. He also became an independent distributor for a company called Immunotec, which sells dietary supplements and has funded research on the use of its products for children with autism. (Kahan did not respond to emails requesting comment.) Chany and Kahan joined forces. In 2014, Peach released a pamphlet called “The Vaccine Safety Handbook: An Informed Parent’s Guide,” listing Kahan as a contributing researcher. It was paid for by advertisements from local businesses and was filled with tales ostensibly linking vaccines to autism, SIDS, allergies, asthma, and cancer. A series of illustrations shows mothers struggling to communicate with arrogant doctors. “Doctor, my child became autistic/epileptic/anaphylactic after his vaccines,” says one woman, cradling an infant in her arms. “Obviously your child was defective. Vaccines are perfect,” the doctor replies. “How many ‘defective’ children would have remained perfectly healthy if not for vaccines?” asks the caption. In another illustration, a woman stands with her arm around a small boy. “My son regressed into autism after his MMR vaccine. Now he’s in his own world and can’t communicate,” she says. “But at least we had no problem enrolling him in school.” The tone of bitterness and regret in the handbook mirrored Chany’s feelings. So, too, did the call to mothers to feel empowered. There was an email address people could write to, and Chany would respond. The pamphlet also provided the number for a “Peach Hotline,” which connected callers to Akeres Habayis. Through the hotline they solicited volunteers, and Chany told those who contacted her how to distribute the pamphlet in their neighborhoods. “It’s a grassroots movement,” she says. “It’s literally person to person.” Measles is “literally all over the street,” says Dov Landa, a physician assistant in Williamsburg. Natalie Keyssar\n\nIn early 2014, an ultra-Orthodox woman named Zahava, who lives in Williamsburg, found a copy of the Peach pamphlet on her doorstep. For more than 70 years, Williamsburg has been home to Hasidic Jews, many descended from Eastern Europeans who settled there after surviving the Holocaust. Hasidim tend to live in close communities, living by tenets set forth in Jewish texts. Zahava, who agreed to speak as long as her full name wasn’t used, is devout and lives in a large apartment building, where children play together and extended families gather for meals. Others in her building received the Peach pamphlet too, and friends and neighbors pored over the sensational claims, especially those about autism. Roughly 40,000 copies of the pamphlet appeared in kosher grocery stores and by apartment doors in Williamsburg and Borough Park, as well as in ultra-­Orthodox communities in upstate New York and New Jersey. Zahava, who has delicate features, pale skin, and light eyes, read the pamphlet just months after giving birth to her first son. She felt terrified. The pamphlet played on the anxiety that she and other new parents often feel about bringing babies into a world of pesticides, plastics, and pollutants, and it seemed to offer a simple explanation for virtually any physical or developmental anomaly. “It doesn’t take much to put fear into a mother,” Zahava says. “And once the fear is there, it is very hard to get out of it and go to the logic.” Zahava did her shopping at an upscale kosher market and had the groceries delivered to her home. One day, inside her order was another copy of the pamphlet. It came again with subsequent food deliveries, filling her with dread about vaccinating her infant son. Each time she took her boy for a checkup or sick visit, she bombarded Dov Landa, the physician assistant who treated her child, with questions. She felt reassured by his well-­informed answers and his concern for her son, but the self-doubt would creep back in. One day at the grocery store, Zahava saw a pile of the pamphlets and felt her distress well up again. After asking the cashier if she could have them, she walked out with the stack and dropped it into the nearest trash can. Eventually, after her husband consulted with a rabbi, who assured them that the shots were safe, Zahava brought her son to Landa for his vaccinations. In 2015, Zahava had another child, a boy who had an easy temperament but kept getting high fevers and ear infections. “Every time we went to the doctor there was something else going on with him,” she said. His recurring sicknesses meant his immunizations had to be delayed. Just before his second birthday, in 2017, he was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. After nine months of chemotherapy, Zahava’s son went into remission. But with a compromised immune system that wouldn’t respond to vaccines, he couldn’t receive his shots. In October 2018, just a month after her son got the green light to start preschool, Zahava’s husband heard about a measles outbreak on a Yiddish news hotline. A traveler who had contracted the disease in Israel, during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, had brought it back to Brooklyn. The couple called Landa, who suggested that they keep their son home for a little while. Vaccines protect individuals, but they also protect the most vulnerable people in communities through a process called herd immunity. If enough people are immunized, there simply aren’t enough susceptible individuals for a virus to spread easily throughout a group. The virus runs out of steam ramming the doors of impenetrable fortresses before it can reach those who are too young to be vaccinated or whose immune systems are weak. Communities come in various sizes—whole countries, but also small pockets of people who live near each other or who have a strong group identity. To achieve herd immunity against measles, about 95 percent of a community needs to be immunized. And so its success depends on a high degree of cooperation; even a small number of holdouts can precipitate a crisis. That is what happened in Brooklyn—slowly, then all at once. Five years ago, the average vaccination rate at Jewish schools in Williamsburg, Borough Park, and Bushwick was 97.8 percent. Today it’s 96.2. About 9 percent of private schools in Brooklyn have vaccination rates of less than 90 percent. At one yeshiva in the Borough Park neighborhood, almost 97 percent of students were immunized against measles in 2012; today, the rate at that same school has fallen to 72.7 percent. The loss of herd immunity made it almost inevitable that measles would spread rapidly once it was introduced in Williamsburg and Borough Park, where extended families live in close quarters and gather frequently at synagogues and community halls. Measles cases worldwide were rising, with over 170,000 reported in 2017. And in October 2018, measles arrived in Brooklyn not once but at least six times. At least one child carrying the disease arrived from Israel, and other travelers brought it back to the US from Ukraine, where the border war with Russia had disrupted public health efforts. In Indonesia, Madagascar, and the Philippines, poverty and lack of health care access contributed to measles outbreaks. In the UK and a number of other European countries, the misinformation was largely responsible for heightened vulnerability. Misinformation has been spreading for years on tech platforms, thriving within what researchers call “small world” networks—clusters of people who are highly interconnected and tend to reinforce each other’s views. Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube had done little to limit the spread of propaganda, but as measles flared across the country, and pressure from lawmakers and journalists mounted, they succumbed and took modest steps. Facebook, for instance, announced it would stop letting antivaccine information be promoted through ads or recommendations, though plenty of well-known agitators remain active. On Amazon, books skeptical of vaccines still dominate search results. In Brooklyn’s ultra-Orthodox communities, the Peach name was adopted by other groups of vaccine-skeptical parents. In 2018, as the disease surged through yeshivas and play groups, Chany’s forum continued getting phone calls. Women with sick children dialed in to Akeres Habayis and traded remedies they used to take care of their kids at home. Some were hesitant to go to pediatricians and be reported to the department of health, Chany says. “Measles is not polio,” she adds, “and it’s not smallpox. It’s not the bubonic plague either.” But measles can have serious, long-term consequences, such as immune-system suppression and cognitive impairment, even for healthy children. And to someone like Zahava, with a vulnerable child, it was every bit as frightening as the plague. When another Peach pamphlet appeared on Zahava’s doorstep in 2018, her frustration mounted. She heard a rumor that a child in her son’s preschool class had measles. Zahava called the mother, explaining that if her son contracted the virus it could lead to pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death. She needed to know if the woman’s child had the disease before she sent him back to school. “I told her I needed to protect my child,” Zahava says. “And she said, ‘So maybe give him some vitamins to boost his immune system.’ I told her that wasn’t going to help at this point … She went on about how vaccines cause cancer and autism and everything in between. I’m like, ‘This is totally not where I wanted the conversation to go. Can we start again? Does your child have measles or not?’ ” Zahava knew that the vast majority of parents in Williamsburg still immunized their children. But the minority seemed the loudest. At a bris for her nephew, a woman was “talking herself blue in the face about how bad vaccines are.” Zahava noticed three other women—one with a baby, one pregnant, and one newly married—listening, rapt. Later, she regretted not speaking up. When her sister-in-law told her about an Orthodox nurse named Blima Marcus who was leading workshops on vaccines, Zahava decided to invite her to Williamsburg. In December about 10 Hasidic women, mostly in their twenties and thirties, sat in tiny orange chairs in a kindergarten classroom in a local school. Marcus, who stood at the front of the room, is an oncology nurse who devotes part of her time to counseling religious families on end-of-life care. When she became aware of how much misinformation was making the rounds in her community, she gave herself a crash course in the science of vaccines. She spends hours a week talking to mothers, taking pains to listen to their concerns. That day, one of her first questions to the women in the classroom was whether she needed to bother addressing whether vaccines cause autism. Given the settled science, she didn’t want to spend time unnecessarily. To her surprise, she says, “The women were like, ‘Of course we need to discuss autism!’” Marcus explained how Andrew Wakefield’s study had breathed life into the antivax movement. But the study was tiny and deeply flawed. “In over 20 years of research, that study has never, ever been reproduced,” Marcus told the women. Meanwhile, numerous papers, examining the medical records of hundreds of thousands of children, have found no association between the MMR vaccine and symptoms of autism. She told the women how, in 1993, Japan suspended the use of MMR vaccines because of concern about the mumps portion of the vaccine then being used in that country. But during the time in which the vaccine’s use dropped to zero, autism rates kept rising. When Marcus showed the women a graph of the two trends moving in opposite directions, several of them gasped. “That was it for most people in the room,” Marcus says. In her no-nonsense manner, Marcus refuted other myths about immunization. Some women had heard that vaccines contain aluminum that can cause harm to children; Marcus explained that aluminum is used to boost the body’s response to immunization, and most of it is cleared from the system within days. Minuscule quantities of even scary-sounding substances are unlikely to cause harm, she said, invoking the old saying “The dose makes the poison.” Zahava’s sister-in-law was there and felt a rush of relief. Hearing misinformation day after day, she says, makes it easy to second-guess yourself and think, “‘One second, am I the crazy one?’ The nurse actually had answers to all this nonsense.” Blima Marcus, an Orthodox nurse, explains vaccines to mothers in her community. Natalie Keyssar\n\nIn late March, flyers appeared on lampposts around Williamsburg and Borough Park: “Once and for all, Clarity!” The flyer featured an image of a massive syringe in a doctor’s hand, with the words “Vaccines save lives!” It then showed the same syringe emerging from the barrel of a gun, countering “Vaccines are dangerous!” Similar announcements ran, in Yiddish and English, in free local newspapers. The text of the flyer provided phone numbers for a call-in discussion with doctors, lawyers, rabbis, and politicians on March 31 at 8:30 pm. In Williamsburg, robocalls urged families to listen in. Zahava says she received five reminders on her landline in the days leading up to the event. No one seemed to know who was organizing the call. Dov Landa, who treats Zahava’s children and about 10,000 others in New York, had seen the announcements on a WhatsApp chat group and speculated throughout the day with colleagues. Landa estimates that only 1 percent of his patients are staunchly opposed to vaccines, while perhaps 20 percent are sincerely confused, awash in fearful misinformation. “They’ve heard the message so many times, even the moderates start to believe that maybe there’s something to it,” he says. His approach is to talk to parents about vaccine safety, one on one, again and again. He rarely leaves the office before 10 pm and often finds himself texting answers to questions about the MMR vaccine in the middle of the night. He was up at 2 am recently convincing a reluctant father to bring his daughter in for a second shot, which the family had delayed for years. Landa, who is a member of the Lubavitch Orthodox sect, passes out a pamphlet that Blima Marcus wrote with a group of other Orthodox nurses about the virtues of vaccines. He reminds parents that many rabbis have strongly supported routine shots. This form of persuasion is “painfully slow,” he says, but he believes that in the long run it is the most effective way to change minds. SIGN UP TODAY Sign up for the Backchannel newsletter and never miss the best of WIRED. None of those messages were aired in the March 31 event. Instead of presenting scientific information, the call featured vaccine skeptics or outright critics. It was organized by a group called PACT—Parents Advocating for Children Together. Chany says Peach isn’t connected to PACT but told me “it’s the same idea.” In the past few years, among the ultra-Orthodox, the antivax movement has become a larger, loosely organized confederation: “If someone wants to do an event, they just do it,” she says. “There’s no central organization.” Chany supported PACT by donating through the group’s GoFundMe page and called in to listen. “It was good,” she says. “It woke people up.” During the call, Del Bigtree, who produced the movie Vaxxed with Andrew Wakefield and others, conducted an interview with Lawrence Palevsky, who describes himself as a holistic pediatrician. In sober cadence, Palevsky said “medical scientists are even using ­measles virus as a way to cure cancer. So of course people want to know the next question: If the measles virus is being used to help people resolve their cancer, is it possible that having the measles is a protector against getting cancer later on in life?” Zahava, who had tuned in almost as a test of resolve, felt stricken. At 11:30 that night she texted Blima Marcus: “Do you inject people with measles to cure cancer?” Marcus replied, “Inject measles to cure cancer? What?” Marcus told Zahava that measles actually weakens the immune system for two to three years. “And if so, measles prevents cancer,” Zahava replied, still with a glimmer of doubt. “No,” Marcus assured her. “It doesn’t.” For several days, Landa’s patients also inundated him with questions about the call. One mother unfolded the insert to the MMR vaccine in front of patients in the hallway and worried aloud about its contents. By that time, the New York City Department of Health was reporting a total of 317 measles cases in the city since the start of the outbreak. But Landa estimated that the true number was many times higher because some patients were avoiding doctors. Measles is “literally all over the street,” he told me. (By mid-June the official tally had risen to 596.) That same week, a 4-month-old baby with a fever and hacking cough came into Landa’s office. The boy didn’t have the characteristic measles rash, but he was breathing rapidly, struggling for air. When Landa sent him to a hospital emergency room, he tested positive for measles. The boy’s breathing continued to decline, and he was put on life support with a mask clamped over his face and pressurized oxygen pumped into his lungs. He had developed pneumonia and had to get intravenous antibiotics. Within a few days, a fierce red rash covered his body. After almost a week in intensive care, the boy was discharged to recuperate at home, the long-term effects of the disease still uncertain.

        "text": "In the past few years California has gained ground in its fight to protect children from infectious diseases. But new data released this week shows that the state’s vaccination rate declined for the second year in a row.\n\nLast fall 94.8 percent of California kindergartners had received all their shots, down from 95.6 in 2016-2017. That drop may look small, but California has about as many kindergartners as Wyoming has people. The most recent figures show that California now falls below the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommended vaccination rate of 95 percent, considered necessary to protect a community from disease outbreaks through herd immunity. Those numbers also obscure big differences in vaccination rates from one zip code to another, from as low as 19 percent in one community in northern Los Angeles County to as high as 99 percent in Watsonville, a farm town in Santa Cruz County.\n\nFour years ago, following a measles outbreak in Southern California that began at Disneyland, California passed Senate Bill 277, a law that eliminated parents’ ability to opt out of mandated vaccinations for their kids based on personal beliefs. At first, the law seemed to be working. When it was passed, 2.4 percent of kindergartners in California weren’t vaccinated because of a personal belief exemption; today, that figure is zero.\n\nBut children can also skip vaccinations if they receive a permanent or temporary medical exemption from a doctor; these are typically given to children who have health conditions, like immune system disorders, that contra-indicate vaccination. Five years ago, just 0.2 percent of California students received a permanent medical exemption, while 2.5 percent claimed a personal belief exemption, or PBE. Since the PBE’s elimination, permanent medical exemption (PME) rates have begun to climb, from 0.7 percent to 0.9 percent for the past year.\n\nCalifornia Department of Public Health data suggests that communities in which PBEs were popular in the past may now be obtaining PMEs. As Barbara Feder Ostrov reported in Kaiser Health News earlier this spring, many schools that previously claimed the highest PBE rates now have high PME rates.\n\nNew data released this week backs up this analysis. The California schools with the highest exemption rates today—we’re talking rates of 40, 50, even 64 percent of a group of a few dozen kindergartners—had PME rates of zero five years ago. So five years ago, kindergarten classes at these schools had no children whose health was compromised to the degree that they could not medically handle immunizations. At the time, those same schools claimed very high PBE rates—ranging from 35 percent to 87 percent. About half of the schools with the highest PME rates are Waldorf schools. (Waldorf schools follow an educational model developed by Rudolf Steiner and Emil Molt that emphasizes bringing out each child’s individual potential in a way that serves humanity.)\n\nTake Yuba River Charter, a Waldorf-affiliated school in Grass Valley, California. (Grass Valley is northeast of Sacramento, in a county where 10.6 percent of kids have a PME and only 80.3 percent are fully vaccinated.) In 2013, more than two-thirds of Yuba River Charter’s kindergartners claimed personal belief exemptions. Today, that figure is zero. But just 36 percent of students at the school are vaccinated, with the remainder claiming a permanent medical exemption. (Administrators did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nPrivate schools have lower immunization rates than public ones: This year 95 percent of children entering public kindergarten had all their shots and 0.7 percent had medical exemptions, while 92.9 percent of private school kindergartners were fully vaccinated and 2.4 percent claimed permanent medical exemptions.\n\nThe permanent medical exemption rates don’t tell the whole story, says Leah Russin, executive director of Vaccinate California, a parent group that advocates for vaccination. (WIRED contributor Renee DiResta is a cofounder of Vaccinate California.) Russin explained that the state also reports on the percent of students who enter schools conditionally—meaning they aren’t fully vaccinated but plan to be in the future. Those numbers include students who have received a Temporary Medical Exemption from their physician. “Kids might not receive a permanent exemption because a temporary exemption is all that’s being offered by the doctor they’re working with,” Russin says. “There’s one doctor who will give a 90-day temporary exemption if you call, and then you have to follow up and get one for a longer term.” (Earlier this year Voice of San Diego identified a single physician behind one-third of medical exemptions written for students in the San Diego Unified School District.)\n\nThrough a public records request, Russin received data from the California Department of Public Health that breaks out the share of students who received temporary medical exemptions. In the 2018-2019 school year, dozens of schools had TME rates of 10 percent or higher, while their PME rates are low. At Highland Hall Waldorf school, in the Northridge area of Los Angeles, 34 percent of students have a temporary medical exemption, while only 4 percent have a permanent exemption. Thirty miles east in Altadena, it’s a similar story at another Waldorf school. “All members of our association are independent and make decisions in accordance with our membership and accreditation criteria,” says Beverly Amico, executive director for advancement at the Association for Waldorf Schools of North America. “These criteria include the expectation that all schools be compliant with national, state, provincial, and local laws.”\n\nThe augmented California data, which Russin shared with WIRED, shows a statewide TME rate of 0.2 percent—that’s on top of the 0.9 percent of students receiving permanent medical exemptions, bringing the state’s total medical exemption rate to 1.1 percent.\n\nClick here for a larger view of this map.\n\nThe rise in medical exemptions has not gone unnoticed. Last month the California Senate passed SB 276, a bill that would set statewide standards for medical exemptions. Authored by California senator Richard Pan, a pediatrician from Sacramento, the bill aims to reduce the rising rate of medical exemptions in the state and is supported by the California branch of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the California Medical Association. The bill now moves to the California State Assembly for consideration; there are questions about whether governor Gavin Newsom will sign the bill should it reach his desk.\n\nThe rise in medical exemption rates isn’t entirely a surprise, says Catherine Flores Martin, executive director at the California Immunization Coalition, a Sacramento-based nonprofit that supports immunization. “We knew that after SB 277 passed the medical exemptions would go up, because we thought that some PBEs might really be medical exemptions that weren’t formalized by the parent.” But the rates continue to rise. “Some physicians are writing these exemptions for things that do not fall under established guidelines, and that’s not safe for public health.” Senator Pan’s bill doesn’t mandate immunizations, Flores Martin says; parents who choose not to can, for example, opt to home-school their kids. “Nobody is forced to vaccinate their children.”\n\nNo one in California is forced to vaccinate children, but in the wake of a measles outbreak in Brooklyn, the New York City health department recently mandated that people who work or live in four zip codes get the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine or face a $1,000 fine. (Medical exemptions, however, are permitted.)\n\nLast month a paper in The Lancet Infectious Diseases identified the 25 US counties most at risk of a measles outbreak. Three California counties, Los Angeles, San Mateo, and San Diego, made the researchers’ top 25 list. According to California Department of Public Health data, while 98 percent of San Mateo kindergartners and 96.4 percent of LA kids received the MMR, only 94.3 percent of San Diego kids were fully protected against measles, below the herd immunity level of 95 percent. This year 51 people have contracted measles in the state, with 10 cases in Los Angeles to date.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories",

        "text": "In a photo from 2009, Bill Halford, who was then 40 years old, looks like a schoolboy who hasn’t quite grown into his big ears. He wears an ill-fitting red shirt tucked into belted khakis; his jawline is square and his eyes are full of wonder. The picture was taken at Southern Illinois University, where he was a respected professor. A few years before, he had made a significant discovery—one that would determine the course of his life. Halford, a microbiologist, had taken an interest in the peculiar nature of herpes—how it lies dormant in the nervous system and reactivates to cause disease. Herpes is one of the most pervasive viral infections in the world, sometimes causing painful genital blisters, and it has frustrated scientists attempting to find a cure. But in 2007, Halford realized that a weakened form of the virus he’d been studying might serve as a vaccine. He designed an experiment in which he inoculated mice with this variant, then exposed them to the wild-type form of the virus. In 2011 he published the results: Virtually all the mice survived. By contrast, animals that were not injected with his vaccine died in large numbers. It was promising science. That same year, however, Halford became seriously ill. At first he thought he had a sinus infection, but it turned out to be a rare and aggressive form of cancer, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma. Halford was 42 years old at the time, with two teenage children. He underwent chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgery, but he was told that the form of cancer he had did not usually stay at bay for long. Halford had always been determined—“a 90-hours-a-week sort of researcher,” as his wife, Melanie Halford, puts it. The cancer diagnosis only seemed to harden his focus. Others had tried, and failed, to develop a herpes vaccine, but Halford was convinced that his method—using a live, attenuated form of the virus—would succeed. He would use whatever time he had left to show he was right. The trouble was that the institutional gatekeepers of science—the agencies that fund research—didn’t view his work with the same urgency. He wasn’t getting the grants he thought he deserved. He felt “alone in the wilderness,” Melanie says, but also certain that his formula held unique promise. The question that drove him was not the practical “Will this work?” but rather an ethical one: “If I can help people suffering from herpes, isn’t it my duty to do so?” Melanie told me that “it was completely obvious to him what needed to be done.” Halford decided to barrel forward on his own unorthodox terms. People with herpes who scoured the internet for research on their condition often discovered Halford’s scientific writing and blog posts, which combined technical information and a wry frustration with the status quo. Several readers reached out to Halford for help. A woman named Carolyn, who ran a private Facebook group devoted to genital herpes, approached him in 2012, and a few months later, Halford got back in touch and suggested they talk by phone. “That’s when he told me he had been fighting cancer and felt he needed to find out if the vaccine he developed could be therapeutic,” Carolyn recalls. In his animal research, Halford was testing whether his attenuated virus could prevent herpes, but scientists were also studying whether herpes vaccines could treat the disease. Carolyn suffered from debilitating nerve pain, and when Halford asked if she wanted to try the drug, she says, “I felt like I had hit the lottery.” Carolyn suffered from debilitating nerve pain, and when Halford asked if she wanted to try the drug, she says, “I felt like I had hit the lottery.” Through his blog and Carolyn’s Facebook group, Halford found other potential research subjects. He told them that the vaccine carried risks, as all vaccines do, but claimed that his formulation was “much safer” than those used for measles, mumps, polio, and chicken pox. Halford reassured the skeptical that he had tested his formula on himself, despite being weak from chemo, and had injected family members, and that they had “no side effects,” says Carolyn, who did not want to give her last name because of the stigma attached to ­herpes. Halford answered the potential volunteers’ questions by email and in long phone conversations. He sent at least one of them pictures of the large, red welts that were likely to develop on their calves around the injection site. In August 2013, Carolyn drove six hours from Kentucky, where she lives, to Springfield, Illinois, where she had booked a room at the Holiday Inn Express. That evening, she and seven other volunteers, who had come from all over the country, gathered with Halford in one of the hotel rooms, where they sat on chairs, the couch, and the bed. “People were excited,” Carolyn recalls. Halford arrived with a box, which contained a tray and small vials, and began “mixing what appeared to be components of the vaccine right there,” Carolyn says. When her turn came, he took a sample of blood, then swabbed her calf with alcohol and drew a circle on the skin with a black felt-tip pen. Within the circle, he injected the mixture. A bump appeared, followed later by a welt. In subsequent months, the volunteers gathered in Springfield twice more for injections. The Halfords invited them to their home for dinner. “We were telling Bill and his wife our stories, and they listened,” Carolyn says. “They are good people.” As a seasoned researcher, Halford was certainly aware that his behavior violated ethical norms, and probably federal regulations as well. The Food and Drug Administration requires that researchers get permission before using an unapproved drug or agent on people in the United States, according to Hank Greely, an expert in biomedical ethics at Stanford Law School. Halford had not said a word to the agency about his plans, nor did he intend to say anything publicly. That “would be suicide,” he told participants in an email obtained by Kaiser Health News. Still, he believed that his brazen behavior would advance the cause of his vaccine; and in one sense, he was right.\n\nAgustin Fernandez is a Hollywood film executive—Badge of Honor, a Martin Sheen drama, is his best known movie. Brash and gregarious with a bald head and, sometimes, a trim goatee, he splits his time between New York and Los Angeles. He also has an outsized fear of herpes. Years ago he started dating a woman with the virus. And at first he thought, “OK, what’s the big deal, you get a rash.” But over time he saw how she suffered during outbreaks and began to fear that he would become infected. “It just completely consumed me,” he says. Fernandez threw himself into online research and, like Carolyn, soon came across Halford’s work. “I just made it my mission to meet him,” Fernandez says. Eventually, Fernandez persuaded Halford to fly to New York and join him for dinner at Frankies 570 Spuntino Italian restaurant. They talked for hours. “Bill probably still thought I was a crazy guy,” Fernandez says. “I was just on a very selfish mission.” Still, they met again in Chicago. Halford confided to Fernandez that he’d secretly tested the vaccine in humans and that a participant named Carolyn had not experienced herpes outbreaks since the injections and had even stopped taking antiviral medications. “I thought I’d found the holy grail,” Fernandez says. To Fernandez, the next step seemed obvious: Start a company. Fernandez didn’t know much about scientific research, but he did know how to intrigue investors. He figured a herpes vaccine would be an easy sell, and more gratifying than raising money for a Hollywood movie. “It’s not like, ‘This is so great, Steven Seagal is going to punch a mummy in the face!’ This is like, ‘We can really change the world.’ ” In 2015 Halford and Fernandez founded Rational Vaccines. Fernandez provided most of the initial money and then reached out to friends and family, raising a total of around $700,000. Halford cared mainly about intellectual control; he would oversee the science. The company also licensed a patent for Halford’s work from Southern Illinois University, where Halford remained a professor. Halford started making plans for a clinical trial overseas, outside the jurisdiction of the FDA—a not uncommon strategy. He never seriously considered submitting plans to the agency, which would have required him to manufacture the vaccine in a standardized manner and comply with the FDA’s oversight and requirements. “It takes years and years,” Melanie says—years that Halford did not anticipate having. CHAD WYS; Digital image courtesy of Getty’s Open Content Program Pharmacological testing of any kind involves risks, and the standards for vaccine safety have evolved over time. Edward Jenner, the late-18th-century English scientist, demonstrated that he could protect an 8-year-old boy from smallpox by exposing him to a related virus called cowpox. It wasn’t until the 1950s, however, when the American virologist Jonas Salk developed a polio vaccine, that the modern era of mass inoculation began. Polio had left thousands of children paralyzed, and Salk’s vaccine is rightly viewed as a triumph of 20th-century science. At the same time, problems at one of the first production labs led to vaccine contamination that paralyzed 164 children and killed 10 others, a tragedy that might have been averted with better safety testing. Improved oversight of drug development arrived in 1962 with the modernization of the FDA. In the wake of the thalidomide scandal, in which a drug to treat morning sickness was found to cause birth defects, the agency began requiring companies to complete three phases of clinical testing, demonstrating the safety and efficacy of their products. Scrutiny of vaccines increased too. In the early days, researchers typically tested vaccines on a few thousand people at a cost of several million dollars. Now they are expected to conduct trials with tens of thousands of subjects, with expenses in the hundreds of millions. Regulators also have strict requirements for ensuring the purity of products that will be tested in humans and tend to be cautious about side effects. “The bar has gotten much higher,” says Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. This can make it hard for small companies to develop vaccines, even when they report promising data. Last fall, Genocea, a small biotech firm, got as far as successful Phase II trial results for a herpes vaccine, but then the company announced that it was halting the effort. It lacked the capital to continue to the next phase of trials, which CEO Chip Clark says would have cost $150 million. (Genocea says it’s still looking to partner with a larger pharmaceutical company.) Given the FDA’s regulatory standards, some good vaccines surely don’t make it to market because the financial burdens are too great. To Halford, however, any obstacle to his vaccine seemed an injustice. His cancer returned in early 2016, and this time “his doctors were out of good options,” Melanie says. Neither radiation nor surgery was feasible, so he was left with chemotherapy. Each month he received several days of grueling treatment, which left him nauseated and exhausted. Then he plunged into work again, conducting research and planning for a clinical trial on the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts, before starting the chemo cycle over again. Halford began to recruit participants for the clinical trial through his personal blog. The desperation he found in the potential volunteers echoed the urgency of his own prognosis, and he was more responsive to their queries than many of their own doctors had been. A woman named Beth Erkelens, who lives in Colorado, learned about Halford’s work from a Google search that led to his blog. She called him about the clinical trial, and they talked, she says, “for like an hour.” At the time, Erkelens felt desperate. She was 45 years old and, for years, experienced nearly constant itching, as well as about 12 full-blown outbreaks a year. She felt she had nothing to lose and was swayed by Halford’s bold assurances, as well as his promise that Rational Vaccines would reimburse her for airfare and hotel for three trips to Saint Kitts. “It was his confidence that drew everyone in,” she says. So when Halford sent Erkelens an informed-consent document laying out the potential risks of participation and noting that the trial would not include FDA oversight, she signed it without hesitation.\n\nIn June 2016, Erkelens arrived on the tiny island of Saint Kitts, which was quiet in the summer. Rational Vaccines had set up shop in a house high above a turquoise bay. One room became a makeshift medical office. There, Erkelens’ blood was drawn and her temperature taken. Then, as Halford looked on, a physician administered the injection. “We all had high hopes,” she recalls. Initially, Erkelens’ only reaction was a walloping welt, which she had been told to expect and which seemed more of a curiosity to her than anything else. It was also a kind of badge. Before coming to Saint Kitts, Erkelens had avoided talking about her woes, except with potential partners. But on the island it was easy to spot other Americans who had also flown down for the clinical trial. “How do you miss another person with a giant red mark on the back of their leg when there’s no one else around?” In many ways, the trip felt like a group vacation. Erkelens spent about five days on the island and recalls afternoons lounging on the beach, drinking beers at the bar, and exploring the island, where vervet monkeys ambled down from the hills. In the evenings, Fernandez sometimes paid for seafood dinners and drinks out of his own pocket. Participants had been flying to the island since March, receiving injections on a staggered schedule. Fernandez had been there for much of the time. When Erkelens returned home, she was already looking forward to her next island jaunt. She even planned to bring her 11-year-old son to Saint Kitts and stay between her second and third shots so he, too, could enjoy a “big, beachy vacation.” In July, however, when Erkelens and her son arrived in Saint Kitts for her second shot, things did not go so well. This time she experienced an intense herpes outbreak after the injection, along with severe aches and pains, numbness and tingling in her arms and legs, shooting sensations, and “crazy, crazy shaking.” Halford had warned that she might feel flu-like symptoms, but this went far beyond that. By the time her symptoms started setting in, however, the other trial participants and researchers were leaving the island. CHAD WYS; Digital image courtesy of Getty’s Open Content Program A little more than a week later, Erkelens sent frantic messages to Halford telling him how sick she was. “That’s when he called me,” she says. “He was really angry,” insisting, she says, that the symptoms were caused not by the vaccine but by a mosquito-borne virus called chikungunya. But he called back and offered to discuss her symptoms. (Erkelens says she later tested negative for chikungunya.) In early August, Erkelens called Halford in distress from Saint Kitts, where she had remained for several weeks. Halford was in Portland, Oregon. He had flown there to ask a herpes expert named Terri Warren to join the board of Rational Vaccines. Warren, who was trained as a nurse practitioner and ran a sexual-health clinic in Portland for decades, has served as an investigator on more than 100 clinical trials, mostly involving herpes. She and Halford had worked together previously, but as he sat at her kitchen counter and described the experiment already under way in Saint Kitts, she grew increasingly alarmed. “There were no protections for these people,” she says. “There was no one watching over the conduct of this trial.” While US companies frequently pursue clinical research abroad, often to save money, they virtually never do so without oversight from some kind of institutional review board, which tries to ensure that the potential benefits of an experiment outweigh the risk to participants. IRBs review every aspect of a trial: the script researchers use to recruit participants, the entry criteria for the study, the wording of the informed consent document, the protocol for administering the drug or vaccine, rules for record keeping and reporting adverse events. These norms were established in response to historic abuses like the Tuskegee study, in which, over the course of 40 years, researchers observed how syphilis affected African American men without explaining fully what they were researching and failing to treat them even when an effective cure was found. Part of the idea of having a review board, though, is that even well-meaning researchers can lack perspective on their own work and require a third party to set them straight. With mounting agitation, Warren grilled Halford on the kinds of issues an IRB might care about: Where did this vaccine come from? Who manufactured it? How was it shipped? How had he made sure that it was free from contaminants? Halford did not have satisfying answers. Warren also wanted to know how he had screened trial participants and was disturbed to learn that he had included people with two different strains of herpes virus, HSV-1 and HSV-2. The vaccine contained a live form of ­HSV-2, so the risks to individuals who only had HSV-1 were potentially higher. “I mean,” Warren told me, “what was he thinking?” “There were no protections for these people. There was no one watching over the conduct of this trial ... I mean, what was he thinking?” Compounding Warren’s concerns was Halford’s approach to data collection. He relied on questionnaires that participants filled out regarding their symptoms. Warren felt that the self-reports could potentially be influenced by a desire to please the researchers, especially since personal relationships had developed on an isolated island. “There was a lot of socializing with the investigators and the guy from Hollywood,” Warren says. “They’d sit around at the bar and drink and talk, and that’s just not appropriate.” And then there was Halford’s casual approach to adverse events. When he admitted to Warren that some participants were having bad reactions to the vaccine, she asked, “Well, what are you going to do about that? How are you going to follow them?” His response, she says: “We removed them from the trial.” But that solves nothing, Warren told him. It leaves research subjects vulnerable and doesn’t answer crucial questions about the vaccine. “That’s not how you do it,” she told him. “You continue them in the trial and you follow them” because you want to know what the vaccine does. Throughout the two-and-a-half-hour conversation, Warren felt she made little headway with Halford. “I wouldn’t describe him as belligerent, but he was not introspective in any way,” she says. “Just defensive.” She told him she wanted nothing to do with the clinical trial or the company. (Rational Vaccines declined to comment on Warren’s account.) In early August, when Halford returned to Saint Kitts to oversee another round of injections, he asked Erkelens to meet him, Fernandez, and the doctor who administered the injections at a coffee shop. She still felt acutely ill, and as she approached the meeting with her son in tow, she was anxious that her symptoms would not be taken seriously. She also worried about letting Halford down, knowing how much he’d invested in the vaccine. Almost as soon as the conversation started, Erkelens says, Fernandez reminded her that she had signed a legal document acknowledging that the vaccine carried risks. It seemed her relationship with Rational Vaccines had shifted: “I was no longer their friend,” she says. “I was a foe.” (Fernandez denies that he brought up the informed-consent document and says that the company’s primary concern was to address Erkelens’ symptoms.) Halford was not well. “He looked like he might throw up or pass out,” Erkelens says. At one point, she says, he shot her a sympathetic look and brought her and her son outside, where they could talk alone. As they walked along the road, in the direction of Erkelens’ hotel, Halford told her that he wanted to draw her blood again and try to understand why she’d become so ill; she could decide if she wanted the third injection. He had “a very big heart,” says Erkelens, who agreed to provide another blood sample. But she was afraid to continue with the vaccine. “I’m convinced the third shot would have killed me,” she says. “I felt like I was 100 years old.”\n\nHalford’s cancer was taking an increasing toll. When Melanie picked him up at the airport in August, at the end of the clinical trial, he was seeing double and couldn’t drive. She later learned that he had a seizure in Saint Kitts but kept it from her, not wanting her to worry. Racing against time, Halford wrote up the results of the Saint Kitts trial. He reported that 17 out of 20 subjects completed the three-injection series and described, on average, a “3.1-fold reduction in their frequency of herpes-symptomatic days.” For one participant, Halford also presented blood test results, which seemed to indicate a greater range of antibodies to the herpes virus after the vaccine than before. Nowhere in the manuscript did Halford provide data on the three participants who did not complete the trial, nor did he refer to adverse events beyond welts at the injection site. When Halford submitted the manuscript to a peer-reviewed journal called Future Virology, the response was scorching. In reviews later obtained and posted online by Kaiser Health News, one scientist argued that “neither safety nor efficacy has been demonstrated by the data presented” and described the paper as “partly a vision, partly science, and partly wishful thinking.” The reviewers also came down hard on the lack of documented oversight: “Who is giving the immunizations in Saint Kitts and who is following them medically when they return to the US? Where is the clinical protocol based? Is this an end run around the FDA?” The manuscript was rejected. CHAD WYS; Digital image courtesy of Getty’s Open Content Program If Halford failed to win approval from academic peers, he struck gold with investors. Earlier that year, Fernandez says, an angel investor named Paul Bohm, who had cofounded a hackerspace called Metalab and had Silicon Valley ties, reached out to Rational Vaccines and offered to put the company in touch with venture capitalists. Drawing on these connections, Fernandez spent months pitching the research. In April 2017, at a symposium at Southern Illinois University, Halford stood in an auditorium and described the long arc of his research. A former managing director of Credit Suisse named Bart Madden was in the audience, and he was enthralled. “He’s got a patch on his eye, he can’t hear out of one ear, he’s all messed up, but he gets up there for 20 minutes,” Madden says. “I felt like I was watching history being made, just like the smallpox cure with [Edward] Jenner.” Madden later invested $750,000, Fernandez told me. (Bohm did not respond to requests for an interview, and Madden declined to confirm or comment on the size of his investment.) Madden, who retired from Credit Suisse in 2003, is an author and policy adviser to the conservative-libertarian Heartland Institute. He focuses on market-based solutions to public policy issues. In 2010 he wrote a book called Free to Choose Medicine, which argues that the FDA’s risk-averse approach to drug approval gets in the way of innovation and keeps life-saving medicines off the market. He first heard about Halford in early 2017, when a documentary filmmaker contacted him for an interview about Halford’s research and free-to-choose medicine. In Madden’s eyes, Halford embodied the part of the brilliant outsider tangling with the scientific establishment. Madden also took note that Peter Thiel, the legendary early investor in Facebook, was also interested in Rational Vaccines. Thiel is known for contrariness and taking arms against regulation and norms. A libertarian, he has criticized the FDA, calling the agency too restrictive and questioning whether an innovation like the polio vaccine could be achieved today. “It caught my attention that Peter Thiel had done an incredible amount of due diligence on this,” Madden says. (Fernandez says he was first introduced to Jason Camm, the chief medical officer of Thiel Capital, by Paul Bohm, in early 2017. Camm was present at the April symposium, according to Fernandez, but Thiel was not.) “I had to take a chance. Dr. Bill was dying. Nobody wanted to speak up, so I was like, ‘I’ll do it.’ ” Madden also was moved by the testimony of a trial participant named Rich Mancuso, who attended the symposium. Mancuso has red hair and a puckish smile. He was working as an exterminator in New Jersey when he first met Halford online. He had been infected with herpes for more than 20 years, and though the symptoms waxed and waned, he experienced outbreaks as often as twice a month on his genitals and face. Mancuso told Madden about the humiliation of living with inflamed facial sores and the financial toll of paying for antiviral medicines. Dating was nearly impossible, and one rejection in particular brought him to the verge of suicide. Since receiving three shots of Halford’s vaccine, however, he had intervals of several months without the blistering sores. In gratitude, Mancuso chose to speak publicly to make his support more credible. “I had to take a chance,” he told me. “Dr. Bill was dying. Nobody wanted to speak up, so I was like, ‘I’ll do it.’ ” With strong interest from investors—and at least one public success story—the company’s fortunes appeared to be ascendant. Halford’s health, however, was spiraling downward. By May 2017, it was no longer possible for him to work. And by early June, it was clear that he was close to death. Halford had a jade necklace that he wore at all times, “like a talisman, to remind him to seize the day,” Melanie says. He got it a couple of years after his diagnosis, on a family trip to New Zealand. On June 22, he placed the necklace on his nightstand; when Melanie saw it there, she realized it was his way of saying, “I’m giving this up now.”\n\nIn August, two months after Halford’s death, the company received a total of $7 million from investors, Fernandez says, including $4 million from Thiel funds. At nearly the same time, however, Kaiser Health News broke the story that Halford had carried out a clinical trial with no guidance from the FDA or an institutional review board. The dean of Southern Illinois University’s School of Medicine had once referred to Halford as a “genius,” and the school had promoted his vaccine work on its website. But when details of the Saint Kitts research emerged, the university quickly distanced itself, saying that the institution was unaware of the trial’s oversight issues until after the work was done. The university has acknowledged that there were serious problems with Halford’s work, and its medical school has halted all herpes simplex virus research. A spokesperson confirmed that “the government is conducting an investigation, and we are fully cooperating.” Rational Vaccines is trying to weather the storm. As CEO, Fernandez is now charting a new course for the company, leaning on a recently hired chief technical officer as well as his investors. Madden says he first learned of the hotel-room injections and lack of oversight in Saint Kitts from news reports and admits he is troubled by what he heard. At the same time, “I don’t want to give opinions about this scientist that I revere,” he says, referring to Halford. “Was it done the right way? No.” But he said that now the company would comply with “the highest standards of gathering data.” Fernandez says Thiel Capital is also encouraging Rational Vaccines to conduct Phase I trials to follow FDA protocols. Camm, the chief medical officer at Thiel Capital, is “really one of the driving forces behind this whole thing,” Fernandez says. “If it were up to him, we’d be at the FDA already. I’m the one saying, ‘Let me get all the ducks in a row.’ ”(Neither Camm nor Thiel responded to numerous requests for interviews. ) Related Stories How Crispr Could Snip Away Some of Humanity's Worst Diseases\n\nInside the Company Delivering the Next Generation of Cancer Therapies\n\nCould a Vaccine Protect Football Players From Concussions? The US market is lucrative and large, and “if you want to sell a treatment in the US, you have to play by US rules,” says Greely, of Stanford Law School. “I don’t care how libertarian you are.” That doesn’t mean that the company will have an easy time with the FDA, which will likely ask to see all the data from Saint Kitts, as well as the lab notes for the animal studies. “The FDA will go back and look at the records, and if they’re not in order, they can’t be used,” says Robert Califf, a former commissioner of the agency. Still, if the company can convince the agency that the vaccine looks promising in animals—and that it is prepared to follow the rules—the agency is likely to allow further research. The FDA’s goal is not to punish, Califf says, speaking generally. “If there’s a good product and a bad company, the role of the FDA is to help get the good product through the system.” (The FDA declined to comment.) Of course, more often than not, products that seem exciting in preclinical work fail in subsequent rounds of testing. Plenty of potential herpes vaccines, both preventive and therapeutic, have disappointed researchers in late-stage animal testing or in clinical trials over the years. “I think collectively we’ve all thrown the kitchen sink” at herpes efforts, says Clark, of Genocea. “It’s a hard virus, it really is.”",

        "text": "Among the best-selling books in Amazon’s Epidemiology category are several anti-vaccine tomes. One has a confident-looking doctor on the cover, but the author doesn’t have an MD—a quick Google search reveals that he’s a medical journalist with the “ThinkTwice Global Vaccine Institute.” Scrolling through a simple keyword search for “vaccine” in Amazon’s top-level Books section reveals anti-vax literature prominently marked as “#1 Best Seller” in categories ranging from Emergency Pediatrics to History of Medicine to Chemistry. The first pro-vaccine book appears 12th in the list. Bluntly named “Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism,” it’s the only pro-vaccine book on the first page of search results. Its author, the pediatrician Peter Hotez, a professor in the Departments of Pediatrics and Molecular Virology & Microbiology at the Baylor College of Medicine , has tweeted numerous times about the amount of abuse and Amazon review brigading that he’s had to fight since it was released. Renee DiResta (@noUpside) is an Ideas contributor for WIRED, the director of research at New Knowledge, and a Mozilla fellow on media, misinformation, and trust. She is affiliated with the Berkman-Klein Center at Harvard and the Data Science Institute at Columbia University. Over in Amazon’s Oncology category, a book with a Best Seller label suggests juice as an alternative to chemotherapy. For the term “cancer” overall, coordinated review brigading appears to have ensured that “The Truth About Cancer,” a hodgepodge of claims about, among other things, government conspiracies, enjoys 1,684 reviews and front-page placement. A whopping 96 percent of the reviews are 5 stars—a measure that many Amazon customers use as a proxy for quality. However, a glance at Reviewmeta, a site that aims to help customers assess whether reviews are legitimate, suggests that over 1,000 may be suspicious in terms of time frame, language, and reviewer behavior. Once relegated to tabloids and web forums, health misinformation and conspiracies have found a new megaphone in the curation engines that power massive platforms like Amazon, Facebook, and Google. Search, trending, and recommendation algorithms can be gamed to make fringe ideas appear mainstream. This is compounded by an asymmetry of passion that leads truther communities to create prolific amounts of content, resulting in a greater amount available for algorithms to serve up … and, it seems, resulting in real-world consequences. A recent resurgence of measles outbreaks has the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the US Congress questioning the impact of anti-vaccine misinformation on public health. Investigative journalists and academics have been examining one facet of this problem: what curation algorithms are doing to tamp down—or spread— health misinformation online. What they’re finding isn’t encouraging.\n\nOver the past decade or so, we’ve become increasingly reliant on algorithmic curation. In an era of content glut, search results and ranked feeds shape everything from the articles we read and products we buy to the doctors or restaurants we choose. Recommendation engines influence new interests and social group formation. Trending algorithms show us what other people are paying attention to; they have the power to drive social conversations and, occasionally, social movements. Curation algorithms are largely amoral. They’re engineered to show us things we are statistically likely to want to see, content that people similar to us have found engaging—even if it’s stuff that’s factually unreliable or potentially harmful. On social networks, these algorithms are optimized primarily to drive engagement. On Amazon, they’re intended to drive purchases. Amazon has several varieties of recommendation engine on each product page: “Customers also shopped for” suggestions are distinct from “customers who bought this item also bought”. There are \"sponsored\" products, which are essentially ads. And there’s “frequently bought together,\" a feature that links products across categories (often very useful, occasionally somewhat disturbing). If you manage to leave the platform without purchasing anything, an email may follow a day later suggesting even more products. Amazon shapes many of our consumption habits. It influences what millions of people buy, watch, read, and listen to each day. It’s the internet’s de facto product search engine—and because of the hundreds of millions of dollars that flow through the site daily, the incentive to game that search engine is high. Making it to the first page of results for a given product can be incredibly lucrative. Unfortunately, many curation algorithms can be gamed in predictable ways, particularly when popularity is a key input. On Amazon, this often takes the form of dubious accounts coordinating to leave convincing positive (or negative) reviews. Sometimes sellers outright buy or otherwise incentivize review fraud; that's a violation of Amazon’s terms of service, but enforcement is lax. Sometimes, as with the anti-vax movement and some alternative-health communities, large groups of true believers coordinate to catapult their preferred content into the first page of search results. (Amazon disputes this characterization and says they carefully police reviews.1) Amazon reviews appear to figure prominently in the company’s ranking algorithms. (The company will not confirm this.) Customers consider the number of stars and volume of reviews when deciding which products to buy; they’re seen as a proxy for quality. High ratings can lead to inadvertent free promotion: Amazon’s Prime Streaming video platform launched with a splash page that prominently featured Vaxxed, Andrew Wakefield’s movie devoted to the conspiracy theory that vaccines cause autism. Perhaps compounding the problem, Amazon allows content creators to select their own categories and keywords. While writing this article, I experimented with the listing tool for Kindle books; the keywords and categories are entirely self-selected. Amazon Amazon With a product base as large as Amazon’s, it’s probably a challenge for the company to undertake any kind of review process.

        "text": "On Monday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came out with its latest measles numbers and, let’s be honest, they weren’t great. At least 465 cases across 19 states have been reported so far this year, including 78 in the last week alone. Nationwide, that means more people have caught the notoriously contagious disease in the past three and a half months than all of last year. According to the CDC, it’s the “second greatest number of cases reported in the US since measles was eliminated in 2000.” As outbreaks continue to spike around the country, local governments are increasingly feeling pressure to do something about them.\n\nOn Tuesday, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency in Brooklyn and issued mandatory measles vaccine requirements for people living in or near Williamsburg, the neighborhood where an outbreak has infected 285 people since last fall. Affected individuals were told they have 48 hours to get immunized; those who don’t comply risk receiving tickets or possibly facing fines of $1,000.\n\nIt’s the second time this year that a local government agency has flexed its authority to impose strict measures meant to curb a measles outbreak. In March, New York’s Rockland County banned unvaccinated children from attending schools, visiting shopping malls, and otherwise occupying enclosed public spaces in a last-ditch effort to stem an outbreak that has tallied 168 confirmed cases since October.\n\nThese kind of controversial actions can backfire though. In Rockland County’s case, a judge decided Friday to overturn the ban because it exceeded a five-day statutory limit on declarations of emergency. Many law-school students spent class time Tuesday debating whether New York City’s edict will soon face a legal challenge of its own. But the fact is, in both cases, health officials arrived at these options only after a bunch of other strategies failed. Once an outbreak gets going, there’s only so much that can be done to contain it. Policies that would prevent such outbreaks from occurring in the first place are the purview of state legislators. And in most places they’ve made it easier, rather than more difficult, to opt out of vaccinations. So while such emergency mandates aren’t ideal, public health policy experts say they’re an inevitable outcome of laws that have permitted vaccination exemptions to flourish in recent years.\n\n“As a society we’ve said we’ll allow a little bit of flexibility in our laws in order to give people a wider berth to exercise their personal beliefs. And for decades that vaccine policy has been largely effective,” says Ross D. Silverman, a professor of public health law at Indiana University. Unlike in Europe, where 11 countries have had to put some sort of compulsory vaccination policies in place, Americans have been mostly willing public health participants. National vaccination rates for MMR, the measles vaccine, currently sit above 91 percent, close to the 94 percent cutoff that scientists believe is necessary to acquire herd immunity.\n\nBut over the last 10 years, many states have made it easier for parents to get personal exemptions for vaccinations. Recent analyses have shown that since 2009, the number of nonmedical exemptions rose in 12 of the 17 states that relaxed their laws to allow for philosophical objections as well as religious ones. In some anti-vaccine hot spots, exemption rates are nearing double digits. “It’s been a pretty recent phenomenon that people are now saying their concerns about vaccination outweigh their concerns about infectious diseases,” Silverman says. “And it’s starting to test the balancing act most states are trying to pull off.”\n\nAt least in some places, the threat of bigger outbreaks appears to be tipping the scales toward more restrictive policies. At least eight states, including some that experienced measles spikes this year, are now taking a harder look at their lax personal-exemption laws. When you add up the costs of an outbreak, it’s not hard to see why. A single five-month outbreak in Minnesota in 2017 that infected 79 people ran the state a tab of $2.3 million.\n\nStricter laws should help boost vaccine rates, but it’s not always enough. In 2015, California ditched its personal-belief exemptions, making it only the third state—along with West Virginia and Mississippi—to have such rigid requirements. As a result, fewer students skipped shots, and by 2018 immunization rates statewide were once again above the 94 percent threshold. But researchers discovered that over the same time period, medical exemptions grew. It turned out that many parents were getting around the new law by convincing doctors to grant them medical exemptions. That’s why California is now considering a bill that would crack down on the medical exempting process, to ensure they’re reserved only for people who really need them—kids who’ve undergone chemotherapy or organ transplants or who suffer from immune disorders.\n\nDorit Reiss, a professor at UC Hastings College of Law in San Francisco and a member of pro-vaccine advocacy group Vaccinate California,1 hopes that these kinds of reforms will prevent California from having to issue the kind of emergency measures currently in effect in New York City. “That was a big step. As far as I know no one’s ever used their authority this way for measles,” she says.\n\nSuch actions taken to ensure public safety may be rare, but they have a long history going back to the time of smallpox. In the 1905 case of Jacobson v. Massachusetts, the US Supreme Court gave authority to states and cities to enact compulsory vaccination policies in the event of an active outbreak that endangered public health. It’s been used over the years as precedent to swat away lawsuits from anti-vaxxers who’ve been ordered to keep their kids home from school during outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases, including influenza and chickenpox. But it would be nice if no one ever had to use them in the first place. “We know that outbreaks are more common the easier it is to get exemptions, and these drastic measures are clearly a response to that trend,” Reiss says.\n\nBut Reiss and Silverman both say that laws are only part of the solution. Funding public health outreach efforts to educate vaccine-hesitant parents and connect them with resources has to also be a priority for policymakers. And until that happens, cities like New York will resort to pressuring its citizens to go under the needle. In Rockland County, officials are appealing the decision to end the ban. And in the meantime, they're finalizing new orders intended to keep people who’ve been exposed to measles at home. At a press conference Tuesday afternoon, Rockland County executive Ed Day said the new rules could be released in a matter of days. “There is no absolute answer here,” he said. “We’re trying to do the best we can while respecting the civil liberties the constitution guarantees.”\n\n1Disclosure: Vaccinate California was cofounded by WIRED Ideas contributor Renee DiResta.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories",

        "text": "HIV has no cure. But it's not quite the implacable scourge it was throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Education, prophylactics, and drugs like PrEP have cut down its transmission. Anti-retroviral treatments keep HIV-positive people's immune systems from collapsing.\n\nBut still, no cure. Part of the problem is HIV's ability to squirrel itself away inside a cell's DNA—including the DNA of the immune cells that are supposed to be killing it.\n\nThe same ability, though, could be HIV's undoing. All because of Crispr. You know, Crispr: The gene-editing technique that got everyone really excited, then really skeptical, and now cautiously optimistic about curing a bunch of intractable diseases. Earlier this week, a group of biologists published research detailing how they hid an anti-HIV Crispr system inside another type of virus capable of sneaking past a host's immune system. What's more, the virus replicated, and snipped HIV from infected cells along the way. At this stage, it works in mice and rats, not people. But as a proof of concept, it means similar systems could be developed to fight a huge range of diseases—herpes, cystic fibrosis, and all sorts of cancers.\n\nThose diseases are all treatable, to varying degrees. But the problem with treatments is you have to keep doing them in order for them to work. \"The current anti-retroviral therapy for HIV is very successful in suppressing replication of the virus,\" says Kamel Khalili, a neurovirologist at Temple University in Philadelphia and lead author of the recent research, published in Molecular Therapy. \"But that does not eliminate the copies of the virus that have been integrated into the gene, so any time the patient doesn't take their medication the virus can rebound.\" Plus treatments can—and often do—fail.\n\nGene therapy has promised to revolutionize medicine since the 1970s, when a pair of researchers introduced the concept of using viruses to replace bad DNA with good DNA. The first working model was tested on mice in the 1980s, and by the 1990s researchers were using gene therapies—with limited success—to treat immune and nutrition deficiencies. Then, in 1999, a patient in a University of Pennsylvania gene therapy trial named Jesse Gelsinger died from complications. The tragedy temporarily skid-stopped whole field. Gene therapy had been steadily getting its groove back, but the 2012 discovery that Crispr could make easy, and accurate, cuts on human genes, has added even more vigor.\n\nCrispr as an agent for curing HIV has its own problems. For one, it has to be able to snip away the HIV from an infected cell without damaging any of the surrounding DNA. HIV mutates and evolves, so Khalili and his co-authors couldn't just program their Crispr system with a single genetic mugshot. Instead, they had to target enough unchanging sections that were also critical to the virus' survival.\n\nTheir next challenge was delivering the system to a critical mass of infected cells. First you have to get it past the immune system—which is programmed to attack any non-foreign object entering the body. In a gene therapy trial in 1999, a patient named Jesse Gelsinger died because his immune system overreacted to the viral vectors carrying the therapy. So doctors hoping to prescribe gene therapy have to be aware of patients' prior viral exposure.1 These researchers avoided the problem by packing their Crispr system inside a type of virus called AAV (short for adeno-associated virus). \"AAVs are a very small helper virus, they can't actually replicate in a cell on their own unless they have another virus there to help it along,\" says Keith Jerome, a microbiologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. \"The great thing about AAVs is they cause essentially no immune system response in humans.\"\n\nIn order to get approved for human use, this type of Crispr-borne cure would have to be both safe and effective. This study got part of the way. This study was going strictly for efficacy: Does this work? Khalili and his co-authors treated mice and rat model with strains of HIV that were latent—hiding away in cellular DNA—and others where the HIV was actively replicating. Then they used it on mice grafted with human cells. In all three cases, the HIV rates went down significantly.\n\nOther good news on the safety front: There's no evidence their trial made any off-target cuts. But they'll need to run more experiments to make sure that's absolutely the case, probably using primate models, since their DNA is closer to humans'. They also have to make sure the treatment gets rid of enough HIV, so that it doesn't just replicate itself back to harmful levels. \"In actual human patients there’s no way that a Crispr gene therapy will ever get 100 percent of HIV,\" says Paul Knoepfler, a stem cell biologist at UC Davis. \"How highly efficient will be 'efficient enough' to make a clinically meaningful impact?\"\n\nKhalili believes he can get close enough. According to him, the Crispr system doesn’t need to eliminate all the HIV-infected cells—just enough so an HIV-patient’s immune system can get strong enough to take care of the rest on its own. \"I strongly believe in the gene editing strategy, and with my 30 years in HIV research, I think this is the one that is going to take us to the end.\"\n\nHe's not the only optimist. \"The advantage of using a virus as your delivery system is it can infect virtually every cell,\" says Jianhua Luo, a pathologist at the University of Pittsburgh. Luo is using a similar Crispr-in-a-virus system to target cancerous DNA in cells.\n\nAnd curing HIV could be a proof-of-concept for other diseases—even genetic diseases people are born with. Even though the virus starts as a simple infection, once it becomes part of a person's chromosome, it essentially becomes a genetic disease. Imagine a world where, instead of removing her breasts, Angelina Jolie could instead have taken a dose of genes that snip away the BRCA2 genes that threatened her with cancer. That's the difference between a treatment and a cure.\n\n1Update 2:50 pm EST 5/26/17: This story has been updated to correct information about the gene therapy trial that resulted in Jesse Gelsinger's death. It was an adenovirus, not an adeno-associated virus, that was used as a vector in that trial.",

        "text": "Every day, UPS, Fedex, and DHL deliver about 37 million packages to doorsteps, front desks, and receiving docks across the globe. Along the way each one will pass through dozens of hands as they’re stacked, sorted, and smushed into planes and trucks. That’s why so many of them show up looking a little, well, world-weary. And why some never show up at all.\n\nThat’s not such a big deal when the parcel is a holiday ham or your twice-yearly Amazon Prime order of toilet paper. But when it’s a $500,000 vial of genetically engineered, cancer-fighting cells, a safe delivery can mean the difference between life and death.\n\nLast year, the FDA approved the first CAR T-cell treatments—a new class of promising therapies that train the body’s immune cells to seek and destroy cancers in the blood. To work, cells have to be extracted from a patient and shipped to a pharma lab to be modified before being shipped back to the hospital for infusion through an IV. And every one of those treatments makes its cross-country journey inside liquid nitrogen-cooled containers with “Cryoport” stamped on the side. That’s the name of the leader in a cottage medical industry—one devoted to delivering next-generation medicines on time and intact.\n\nRefrigerated trucks and shipping containers work just fine for South American produce and farm-raised frozen seafood from Asia. But cells require a more specialized solution. They’ve got to be kept cold enough to suspend all metabolic processes. We’re talking cryogenically cold; -240 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWith the arrival of gene and cell-based medicines, cryogenics logistics is becoming big business. And no one is a bigger player than Cryoport. The California-based company started out in the reproductive and veterinary sciences space nearly 30 years ago, shipping bull sperm and human eggs and chicken vaccines around the world. Today they’ve quickly become the single largest cold chain provider for immunotherapy drugmakers, exclusively transporting the two newly-approved treatments, and servicing more than 200 ongoing clinical trials. On the day I visited the company’s Irvine, California headquarters, the shipping containers waiting for afternoon pickups sported a line-up of the biggest names in the game: Novartis, Kite, Juno, Celgene, Jannssen, Bluebird Bio.",

        "text": "The tech industry is having a moment of reflection. Even Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook are talking openly about the downsides of software and algorithms mediating our lives. And while calls for regulation have been met with increased lobbying to block or shape any rules, some people around the industry are entertaining forms of self regulation. One idea swirling around: Should the programmers and data scientists massaging our data sign a kind of digital Hippocratic oath?\n\nMicrosoft released a 151-page book last month on the effects of artificial intelligence on society that argued “it could make sense” to bind coders to a pledge like that taken by physicians to “first do no harm.” In San Francisco Tuesday, dozens of data scientists from tech companies, governments, and nonprofits gathered to start drafting an ethics code for their profession.\n\nThe general feeling at the gathering was that it’s about time that the people whose powers of statistical analysis target ads, advise on criminal sentencing, and accidentally enable Russian disinformation campaigns woke up to their power, and used it for the greater good.\n\n“We have to empower the people working on technology to say ‘Hold on, this isn’t right,’” DJ Patil, chief data scientist for the United States under President Obama, told WIRED. (His former White House post is currently vacant.) Patil kicked off the event, called Data For Good Exchange. The attendee list included employees of Microsoft, Pinterest, and Google.\n\nBloomberg\n\nPatil envisages data scientists armed with an ethics code throwing themselves against corporate and institutional gears to prevent things like deployment of biased algorithms in criminal justice.\n\nIt's a vision that appeals to some who analyze data for a living. “We're in our infancy as a discipline and it falls to us, more than anyone, to shepherd society through the opportunities and challenges of the petabyte world of AI,” Dave Goodsmith, from enterprise software startup DataScience.com wrote in the busy Slack group for Tuesday’s effort.\n\nOthers are less sure. Schaun Wheeler, a senior data scientist at marketing company Valassis followed Tuesday’s discussions via Slack and a live video stream. He arrived skeptical, and left more so. The draft code looks like a list of general principles no one would disagree with, he says, and is being launched into an area that lacks authorities or legislation to enforce rules of practice anyway. Although the number of formal training programs for data scientists is growing, many at work today, including Wheeler, are self-taught.\n\nTuesday’s discussions yielded a list of 20 principles that will be reviewed and released for wider feedback in coming weeks. They include “Bias will exist. Measure it. Plan for it,” “Respecting human dignity,” and “Exercising ethical imagination.” The project's organizers hope to see 100,000 people sign the final version of the pledge.\n\n“The tech industry has been criticized recently and I think rightfully so for its naive belief that it can fix the world,” says Wheeler. “The idea you can fix an entire complex problem like data breaches through some kind of ethical code is to engage in that same kind of hubris.”\n\nOne topic of debate Tuesday was whether a non-binding, voluntary code would really protect data scientists who dared to raise ethical concerns in the workplace. Another was whether that would have much effect.\n\nRishiraj Pravahan, a data scientist at AT&T, said he is supportive of the effort to draft an ethics pledge. He described how he after he and a colleague declined to work on a project involving another company they didn’t think was ethical, their wishes were respected. But other workers were swapped in and the project went ahead anyway.\n\nAvailable evidence suggests that tech companies typically take ethical questions to heart only when they sense a direct threat to their balance sheet. Zuckerberg may be showing contrition about his company’s control of distributing information, but it came only after political pressure over Facebook’s role in Russian interference in the 2016 US election.\n\nTech companies that make money by providing platforms for others can have additional reason not to be too prescriptive about ethics. Anything that could scare off customers from building on your platform is risky.\n\nMicrosoft’s manifesto on AI and society discussed a Hippocratic Oath for coders, and an ethical review process for new uses of AI. But Microsoft President Brad Smith suggests that the company wouldn’t expect customers building AI systems using Microsoft’s cloud services to necessarily meet the same standards. “That’s a tremendously important question and one we have not yet answered ourselves,” he says. “We create Microsoft Word and know people can use it to write good things or horrendous things.”\n\nPrivacy activist Aral Balkan argues that an ethics code like that drafted this week could actually worsen societal harms caused by technology. He fears it will be used by corporations as a signal of virtue, while they continue business as usual. “What we should be exploring is how we can stop this mass farming of human data for profit,” he says. He points to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation coming into force this year as a better model for preventing algorithmic harms.\n\nPatil was once chief scientist at LinkedIn, but somewhat like Balkan is skeptical of tech companies’ ability to think carefully about the effects of their own personal-data-fueled products. “I don’t think we as a society can rely on that right now because of what we’ve seen around social platforms and the actions of tech companies motivated only by profits,” he says.\n\nLonger term, Patil says one of his hopes for the draft ethics code thrashed out Tuesday is that it helps motivate policy makers to set firmer, but well-considered, limits. “I would like to see what happens here start to define what policy looks like,” he says.\n\nEthical Boundaries",

        "text": "It’s been a turbulent year for the NFL. Ratings plummeted 12 percent in the regular season, even more during the playoffs. It’s hard to know what hurt the league more, its public feuding with the White House over players protesting police brutality during the national anthem or the fact that people don’t watch TV anymore. But it’s not hard to know what’s hurting the league’s players: This season, the NFL reported 281 concussions, the most since the league began sharing that data in 2012.\n\nAs the nation tunes in to Super Bowl LII on Sunday, the link between repeated blows to the head and the neurodegeneration of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, has never been stronger. Strong enough that the NFL has agreed to an estimated $1 billion class-action lawsuit brought by some 18,000 retired players. Strong enough that John Urschel, an offensive lineman for the Baltimore Ravens, retired this past July at the age of 26. His decision came two days after doctors at the University of Boston released a study of 111 brains of former NFL players, in which all but one of them showed signs of CTE. Most were linemen. Urschel, who is pursuing a doctorate in math at MIT, did the calculus and hung up his cleats.\n\nAlthough it’s been 90 years since CTE was first described—in boxers, as “punch drunk syndrome”—the mechanisms of the disease are still poorly understood. Scientists believe that repeated brain trauma triggers the buildup of a neurotoxic protein called tau. But why that results in symptoms of confusion, memory loss, and enhanced aggression is still largely a mystery. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed through autopsy, and there is no treatment.\n\nBut one young biotech company believes there might, one day, be a way to prevent it.\n\nUnited Neuroscience, a three-year-old spinout of veteran vaccine-maker United Biomedical, announced this week it’s developing a drug designed to inoculate the brain against CTE. Traditional vaccines work by introducing a weakened version of a virus, or just a little piece of it, and training the body’s immune system to recognize and assail it. Doing that for a protein you yourself make, like tau, is much trickier. Millions of years of evolution have fashioned the human body into a hardline xenophobe; foreigners bad, me good.\n\nSo United Neuroscience’s team is designing a synthetic frankenmolecule—one that looks a bit like tau, and a bit like a virus, with a damper switch built in to prevent the immune system from going overboard. Importantly, the peptide has to target only the aggregated form of tau, not the normal, free-floating protein that helps stabilize your cells’ internal structures.\n\nYou can think of tau as a necklace, 440 beads long. Sometimes, say after a lifetime of taking left hooks in the noggin, those necklaces get tangled. And it turns out they tangle into a few predictable patterns, only a few of which the body has a hard time getting rid of on its own. So UNS is screening dozens of vaccines to find antibodies that only stick to these versions. They’re currently testing them in animal models and plan to move into clinical trials next year.\n\nIt’s part of the company’s larger strategy to employ these “endobody” vaccines to stave off all kinds of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, perhaps even traumatic brain injury itself. “We wouldn’t take healthcare workers into some area that’s yellow fever-infested without protecting them first,” says Ajay Verma, UNS’s chief medical officer and former US Army Lt. Colonel and staff neurologist at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. “Why not treat vocations that have a high risk of head injury—like professional athletes and soldiers—the same way? We need to start thinking about head trauma as an occupational hazard.”\n\nInoculating troops and footballers against debilitating cognitive trouble so America can keep sending them out to battle on the gridiron or in the fields of Fallujah certainly raises some ethical issues. But it’s the technical issues that will have to be overcome first. Remember how there’s no way to diagnose CTE while the person’s alive? That’s going to make it pretty hard to find CTE patients to test a vaccine in. Companies are working on ways to image tau, and researchers are developing blood tests to monitor how much of the protein is leaking out of the brain. But there’s still an awful lot of work to be done to even prove that getting rid of tau or preventing its buildup in the first place will put a stop to CTE.\n\nIn the meantime, other technologies are arriving to help tackle the problem at the root of CTE: Diagnosing concussions is still a subjective science, and too many hits go unnoticed.\n\nWhen the brain is damaged, neurons release distress signals into the blood, but until recently they’ve occured in amounts too small to measure. That’s changing. Last year diagnostics giant Abbott signed an $11.2 million contract with the Department of Defense to finish developing a blood-based test for concussions they’ve been working on together since 2014. The company is in the process of integrating the assays into their widely used handheld blood analyzers, and expect to make them available to the DoD and the general public within the next year or two.\n\nBrainwaves are also gaining credibility as a potential diagnostic marker. Scientists at Columbia University are prototyping EEG-embedded football helmets that can record concussions in real time, and relay an encrypted version of that signal to a phone or tablet-holding coach on the sideline. It’s a high-tech take on an old approach: In the ‘60s, researchers glued electroencephalographs to the scalps of college players to measure their brain waves, looking for the telltale slow-down after a concussion. They managed to capture the signal, but the detectors were so impractical they abandoned the idea.\n\nToday, with miniaturized sensors and cloud computing, it’s a much more streamlined proposition. And unlike blood tests, the EEG signal can capture what are called “sub-concussive events,” impacts that still destroy neurons, and can pile on additional long-term damage with each hit.\n\n“That period of continuing play, when a player has just been hit in the head and shaken up, is thought to be when they’re at highest risk for a much more dangerous injury,” says James Noble, a neurologist at Columbia’s Irving Medical Center who’s spinning out a company called NoMo to further miniaturize the components and send the helmet toward FDA approval as a formal diagnostic.\n\nBut until there’s a treatment, these promising technologies are likely to be plagued by the same data privacy concerns that the NFL’s failed forays into accelerometer-laden helmets. Nobody negotiating a contract wants a team owner to be able to see how many traumatic brain injuries they’ve sustained. That number could end careers. On the other hand, it could also end lives.\n\nBlows to the Head",

        "text": "About a week ago, Stanford University researchers posted online a study on the latest dystopian AI: They'd made a machine learning algorithm that essentially works as gaydar. After training it with tens of thousands of photographs from dating sites, the algorithm could perform better than a human judge in specific instances. For example, when given photographs of a gay white man and a straight white man taken from dating sites, the algorithm could guess which one was gay more accurately than actual people participating in the study.* The researchers’ motives? They wanted to protect gay people. “[Our] findings expose a threat to the privacy and safety of gay men and women,” wrote Michal Kosinski and Yilun Wang in the paper. They built the bomb so they could alert the public about its dangers.\n\nAlas, their good intentions fell on deaf ears. In a joint statement, LGBT advocacy groups Human Rights Campaign and GLAAD condemned the work, writing that the researchers had built a tool based on “junk science” that governments could use to identify and persecute gay people. AI expert Kate Crawford of Microsoft Research called it “AI phrenology” on Twitter. The American Psychological Association, whose journal was readying their work for publication, now says the study is under “ethical review.” Kosinski has received e-mail death threats.\n\nBut the controversy illuminates a problem in AI bigger than any single algorithm. More social scientists are using AI intending to solve society’s ills, but they don’t have clear ethical guidelines to prevent them from accidentally harming people, says ethicist Jake Metcalf of Data & Society. “There aren’t consistent standards or transparent review practices,” he says. The guidelines governing social experiments are outdated and often irrelevant—meaning researchers have to make ad hoc rules as they go.\n\nRight now, if government-funded scientists want to research humans for a study, the law requires them to get the approval of an ethics committee known as an institutional review board, or IRB. Stanford’s review board approved Kosinski and Wang’s study. But these boards use rules developed 40 years ago for protecting people during real-life interactions, such as drawing blood or conducting interviews. “The regulations were designed for a very specific type of research harm and a specific set of research methods that simply don’t hold for data science,” says Metcalf.\n\nFor example, if you merely use a database without interacting with real humans for a study, it’s not clear that you have to consult a review board at all. Review boards aren’t allowed to evaluate a study based on its potential social consequences. “The vast, vast, vast majority of what we call ‘big data’ research does not fall under the purview of federal regulations,” says Metcalf.\n\nSo researchers have to take ethics into their own hands. Take a recent example: Last month, researchers affiliated with Stony Brook University and several major internet companies released a free app, a machine learning algorithm that guesses ethnicity and nationality from a name to about 80 percent accuracy. They trained the algorithm using millions of names from Twitter and from e-mail contact lists provided by an undisclosed company—and they didn't have to go through a university review board to make the app.\n\nThe app, called NamePrism, allows you to analyze millions of names at a time to look for society-level trends. Stony Brook computer scientist Steven Skiena, who used to work for the undisclosed company, says you could use it to track the hiring tendencies in swaths of industry. “The purpose of this tool is to identify and prevent discrimination,” says Skiena.\n\nSkiena's team wants academics and non-commercial researchers to use NamePrism. (They don’t get commercial funding to support the app’s server, although their team includes researchers affiliated with Amazon, Yahoo, Verizon, and NEC.) Psychologist Sean Young, who heads University of California’s Institute for Prediction Technology and is unaffiliated with NamePrism, says he could see himself using the app in HIV prevention research to efficiently target and help high-risk groups, such as minority men who have sex with men.\n\nBut ultimately, NamePrism is just a tool, and it’s up to users how they wield it. “You can use a hammer to build a house or break a house,” says sociologist Matthew Salganik of Princeton University and the author of Bit by Bit: Social Research In The Digital Age. “You could use this tool to help potentially identify discrimination. But you could also use this tool to discriminate.”\n\nSkiena’s group considered possible abuse before they released the app. But without having to go through a university IRB, they came up with their own safeguards. On the website, anonymous users can test no more than a thousand names per hour, and Skiena says they would restrict users further if necessary. Researchers who want to use the app for large-scale studies have to ask for permission from Skiena. He describes the approval process as \"fairly ad hoc.\" He has refused access to businesses and accepted applications from academics affiliated with established institutions who have proposed \"what seem to be reasonable topics of study.\" He also points out that names are public data.\n\nThe group also went through an ethics review at the company that provided training list of names, although Metcalf says that an evaluation at a private company is the “weakest level of review that they could do.\" That's because the law does not require companies to follow the same regulations as publicly-funded research. “It’s not transparent at all to you or me how [the evaluation] was made, and whether it’s trustworthy,” Metcalf says.\n\nBut the problem isn’t about NamePrism. “This tool by itself is not likely to cause a lot of harm,” says Metcalf. In fact, NamePrism could do a lot of good. Instead, the problem is the broken ethical system around it. AI researchers—sometimes with the noblest of intentions—don’t have clear standards for preventing potential harms. “It’s not very sexy,” says Metcalf. “There’s no Skynet or Terminator in that narrative.”\n\nMetcalf, along with researchers from six other institutions, has recently formed a group called Pervade to try to mend the system. This summer, they received a three million dollar grant from the National Science Foundation, and over the next four years, Pervade wants to put together a clearer ethical process for big data research that both universities and companies could use. “Our goal is to figure out, what regulations are actually helpful?” he says. But before then, we’ll be relying on the kindness—and foresight—of strangers.\n\n*Correction at 1:26 p.m. on 9/19/2017: An earlier version of this story misstated the accuracy of the Stanford algorithm.",

        "text": "Creative Art Direction: Redindhi Studio\n\nJesse Leimgruber has 22 employees, and every last one is older than him. He tells me this over coffee at a downtown San Francisco Starbucks that is equidistant from his company’s coworking space and the one-bedroom apartment he shares with his girlfriend. Leimgruber is the CEO of NeoReach, a digital marketing tools firm he started in 2014 with his brother and a friend; they have raised $3.5 million so far, and last year they did over a million dollars in sales. He is 22.\n\nJessi Hempel is Backchannel's editorial director. ——— Sign up to get Backchannel's weekly newsletter.\n\nLeimgruber is one of 29 people who make up this year’s class of Thiel Fellows — the crazy smart youth paid by Peter Thiel to double down on entrepreneurship instead of school. Leimgruber has dramatic eyebrows, longish hair, and the kind of earnest perma-grin that creeps across his face even when he’s trying to be serious. He speaks with the authority of a three-time CEO who has learned a lot on the job, explaining a challenge particular to fellows like him: “A common piece of advice is, don’t hire your peers; They probably aren’t qualified.”\n\nWelcome to the 2016 version of Peter Thiel’s eponymous fellowship. What began as an attempt to draw teen prodigies to the Valley before they racked up debt at Princeton or Harvard and went into consulting to pay it off has transformed into the most prestigious network for young entrepreneurs in existence — a pedigree that virtually guarantees your ideas will be judged good, investors will take your call, and there will always be another job ahead even better than the one you have. “We look for extraordinary individuals and we want to back them for life,” says executive director Jack Abraham. He speaks with the conviction of a man who sold a company by age 25 has spent the entirety of his professional life in the cradle of the upswing of the technology revolution, and only just turned 30. With no irony, he adds: “We consider ourselves a league of extraordinary, courageous, brilliant individuals who should be a shining light for the rest of society.”\n\nThis is not what Thiel endeavored to build. In 2010, when he set out to take down higher education by plucking kids from the ivory towers of the Ivy League and transporting them to San Francisco, he had his eye on teenagers. In a hastily conceived plan that he announced at a San Francisco tech conference, Thiel said he’d pay $100,000 to 20 people under the age of 20 to drop out of school for two years, move to the Bay Area, and work on anything they wanted. His goal was to jumpstart the kind of big tech breakthroughs — walking on the moon, desktop computing — that he believed the contemporary Valley lacked. He also meant to prove that college was often counterproductive; it required kids to take on debt while laying out a set of overly prescriptive options for their futures. A college diploma, he once said, was “a dunce cap in disguise.”\n\nIn the first years of the program, Thiel’s fellows were a hodgepodge group of searching teens, many of whom didn’t yet have clearly defined projects or end up becoming entrepreneurs. Some even went back to school. His first class, in 2011, included a fellow who had begun studying at MIT when she was 14, and another who, at 19, was in his fourth year of a Ph.D. program in neuroscience. Six came directly from high school.\n\nJesse Leimgruber, a Thiel fellow and CEO at NeoReach. MICHELLE LE\n\nSix years later, the fellowship looks quite different.\n\nTo a person, the fellows are entrepreneurs, and for the most part, they are already successful. They include founders who have already built and sold multiple companies, or made so much money they are acting as angel investors on their own. They have raised a collective $409 million dollars in funding and had $40 million dollars in exits so far. Most are now older than 20 and some have even graduated college. Instead of supplying bright young minds with the space and tools to think for themselves, as Thiel had originally envisioned, the fellowship ended up providing something potentially more valuable. It has given its recipients the one thing they most lacked at their tender ages: a network.\n\nThink of it as a kid version of the Young Presidents’ Organization; it’s a group whose network has grown to include 123 past and current fellows. I’ve now spoken to two dozen of them. And sure, most of them have stopped out of school for some period of time (it does remain a requirement of the fellowship). Yes, the money’s helpful. But the network? That’s everything. The fellows lean on Thiel’s name to open the Valley’s doors (though in the aftermath of the presidential election, it’s not working quite as well as it once did). As important, they lean on each other. After all, the set of challenges you face when you are young — say, young enough that you’re employing people with mortgages at the same time as you’re signing your first lease — are unique. And the types of relationships you cement in adolescence, when you are still forming your ideas about the world and your role within it, are uniquely strong. For Leimgruber, as for many of his peers, Thiel fellows are the first call you make when you have to figure out, say, whether you should hire your friends. Or whom you should ask for money. Or which reporters you should talk to.\n\n“It’s a really strong group, way stronger than even, like, VCs,” Leimgruber says. “If you make friends with three or four fellows, these people are way more likely to have a higher conversion rate on intros than investors do. They’re your friends, whereas with investors, it’s always a favor.”\n\nLike many of the 2016 fellows, Leimgruber didn’t apply. He had grown up in Orlando, where his dad owned an auto shop and his mom worked as a customer account manager. Neither had college degrees. He built his first website at 10, and started an ecommerce site at 15. (Among the most popular products were bright neon hats that said “Rage” and “Party” and became a staple at music festivals.) During his senior year of high school, Leimgruber worked with his brother to start a small digital marketing agency.\n\nBy the time he showed up for his first computer science class at Stanford University in 2012, Leimgruber’s businesses had pulled in a million dollars in revenue. One of his advisors suggested he think about building software tools for digital marketing, instead of a traditional agency. So, he teamed with his older brother and a friend to start NeoReach. He joined a student accelerator, squeezing his classes in on the side. An older student mentioned the fellowship to him that year, but Leimgruber wasn’t interested in leaving school. He’d worked too hard to get there.\n\nBlake Masters, President of the Thiel Foundation and Principal at Thiel Capital Michelle Le\n\nBy sophomore year, Leimgruber shared a campus apartment with five friends, all of whom were working on startups. All were raising money. “It was crazy,” says Leimgruber. “We raised millions of dollars between four companies!” One by one, they began to drop out so they could focus on their companies. One roommate left to become a Thiel fellow. In the fall of 2014, as NeoReach closed in on a million dollars in revenue, it got too hard to manage the company and stay in school. So he took a leave of absence.\n\nLeimgruber had been working from San Francisco for nearly a year when an email arrived from Thiel Foundation president Blake Masters. Masters invited him to a two-day conference in San Francisco. The invitation was a bit last minute, with only two weeks’ notice, but he wouldn’t even have to travel. He figured, why not?\n\nWhen Leimgruber arrived at the conference, he figured out quickly that the event was actually a finalist round for the fellowship. He was one of about a hundred people gathered at Thiel’s offices, which are in the same set of buildings that houses Lucas Films on a leafy campus in the Presidio. Outside, a bronze Yoda statue anchored a fountain in the center of the complex. Inside, supremely young founders from across the globe compared fundraising tips and commiserated on hiring. “It was the first time I met a lot of other young dropouts outside of my Stanford network,” Leimgruber said. Many appeared nervous, he remembers, but he wasn’t. “I was pretty sure that if I wanted it, I would get it,” he said. He had, after all, been recruited. When he got home, he filled out a brief application — it maybe took ten minutes — and then he waited.\n\nLast January, he got the call. It lasted less than ten minutes. Leimgruber had been accepted.\n\nLeimgruber happened to work from the Bay Area, but these days, more than half the fellows don’t. In Boston, Grace Xiao, 20, is working on Kynplex, a social networking software for scientific innovations and Brian Truong, 23, is building software that replaces ads with questions for online publishers. In Durham, North Carolina, Ivonna Dumanyan, 22, is building wearable sensors for athletes. In Los Angeles, Anthony Zhang, 21, is building an on-demand food delivery app for college kids.\n\nThese fellows are very different than their predecessors. They are older. They are often members of founding teams, and occasionally the fellowship will be awarded to more than one founder on a team. (More often, the other founders have aged out; Leimgruber’s cofounders, for example, are 23 and 28.) No one is trying to do anything as impractical and far-reaching as mining space asteroids; their endeavors are scrappier, and more readily turned into the types of businesses that see profit on the horizon. Many come to the fellowship with tech street cred already. Truong managed Boston deal flow for a venture fund while at Harvard, the college from which he graduated in May. Zhang and his cofounders have funding from the accelerator 500 Startups, where they completed the summer 2015 program.\n\nMany fellows, like Sohail Prasad, have completed Y Combinator, or are currently enrolled. A Texas native, Prasad, 23, left Carnegie Mellon’s computer engineering program after his first year. He’d taken a summer internship working on speech technologies at Google. After that summer, he took a startup job and stuck around San Francisco. His YC project was an ebooks company that he later shut down. A couple years later, however, Prasad and two friends started Equidate, a stock market for private tech stocks. One of his YC batch mates was a Thiel Fellow alum (class of ’12) and suggested he apply; he was accepted last May.\n\nPrasad said that while YC offers a larger network, Thiel’s network consistently delivers peers whose companies are more advanced. Also, while YC — and nearly every other accelerator — accepts companies in exchange for a slice of equity, the Thiel Fellowship isn’t interested in profiting from the companies its fellows start. It takes no equity, and even Thiel’s personal funds and the venture firm he founded, Founders Fund, shy away from backing the fellows.\n\nOnce a year, the fellowship gathers all its members for a retreat. This year’s retreat was held in September in Los Angeles. Attendees were treated to a tour of SpaceX, and got individual sessions with executive director Jack Abraham to review any challenges they faced. Everyone received black Everlane backpacks and sweatshirts with “Dropout” written in black letters.\n\nOne figure who was noticeably absent was Thiel. In fact, Leimgruber said that in the nine months he’d been a fellow, he’d only crossed paths with Thiel a couple of times, and then, only in group settings. “I don’t think he would know me,” says Leimgruber.\n\nThiel Fellow Sohail Prasad, Founder & Co-CEO at Equidate Michelle Le\n\nIn late September, Thiel invited current fellows and a few alumni over for dinner. It was one of those rare hot San Francisco evenings when the fog fails to roll in, and many visitors were still in short sleeved t-shirts bearing startup logos as they climbed the steps to his front door. Pizzamakers had set up an oven in the driveway to bake gourmet pies that were whisked through the garage, to the kitchen. From there, servers brought them out to the dining room, placing them between pasta dishes and salads on a large oblong table.\n\nThe room resembled a dorm party in which someone had transported all of the sleep-starved, pizza-munching adolescents to Oliver Warbucks’s penthouse. There was Riley Ennis, a lanky 2013 alum, standing in front of a floor-to-ceiling wall of glass that looked out over the bay. Ennis, 22, had recently landed an investment led by Andreessen Horowitz for his third startup, a genomics company called Freenome that screens blood for early cancer detection. There was Megan Grassell, 20, who had flown in from New York, where she runs a tween bra company. Leimgruber was there. And there, off to the left, was Thiel, hair cropped short, aquiline nose, dressed in light blue jeans and a plaid button-down, chatting with Abraham.\n\nNone of the fellows had yet approached Thiel, so I went over to say hello. I asked him how he felt about the fellowship, and he said it had accomplished one of his primary goals: promoting entrepreneurship as a viable alternative to college. Today, there are university-oriented venture funds (like the Dorm Room Fund), college entrepreneurship programs, and hackathon conferences for teens. Thiel takes some credit for this. “Entrepreneurship has become a line you put on your resume,” he said. But it’s also a reason the fellowship has doubled down on more advanced entrepreneurs in recent years. Thiel never likes to do what everyone else is doing.\n\nThiel is a busy guy, and the fellowship is not his first priority. Apart from parties like this, he doesn’t interact with the fellows too much. For one, he is conscious of the optics of the relationship between the Thiel Fellowship and the Founders Fund. He says he wants to avoid any suggestion that he is creating a training program for his own investments, which is why he almost never invests in current fellows. But he also has a laundry list of obligations. Chief among them, now that Donald Trump has become the United States president elect, is that Thiel is advising him. While he has said that he doesn’t intend to take a formal role in the new administration, Thiel is helping Trump to build up tech policy advisors. Add that to his other obligations, which include his commitment to Founders Fund and his personal fund, Thiel Capital; his foundation’s program to fund early-stage scientific research called Breakout Labs; and the board seats he holds on Palantir Technologies, and Facebook. The fellowship certainly holds his name, and arguably, his interest—but that’s about it.\n\nThe day-to-day responsibility for the fellowship falls to Abraham along with Blake Masters, who is president of the Thiel Foundation and also a principal with Thiel Capital. Both guys do a slew of other things at the same time. Both have been rumored to be people Thiel has tapped to share ideas with Trump’s transition team. They both have experience at startups. Abraham dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania to run Milo, which sold to eBay by the time he was 25. Masters cofounded a legal startup called Judicata, and he was employee number 31 at Box, where’d he’d often spend the night in his office (he kept a George Foreman grill and a blow-up mattress there). But he also has a law degree; he got to know Thiel after he took Thiel’s Stanford law class. Masters’s notes on the class became the viral success that led to Zero to One, the startup handbook that he cowrote with Thiel.\n\nThe first time I stopped by the foundation, in August, Abraham was on the road in Europe somewhere, fundraising for his new company. I followed Masters past a counter holding a copy of a book with Donald Trump’s image, and into his office, which had a glass door that slid shut at the press of a button, straight out of Star Trek. There was a couch and a chair, but no desk. Instead, a bookshelf stretched from floor to ceiling, holding titles like The Power Broker and Immortality.\n\nMasters and Abraham assumed control of the fellowship about 15 months ago, and they’re responsible for its current direction. They did away with large annual summits that had grown to include fellows but also hundreds of other entrepreneurial hopefuls, because they felt these summits were too mainstream. They’d become a stop on the party circuit for entrepreneurial youth. “I remember we had to coordinate with Major League Hacks, which is the organization for all the hackathon stuff, to make sure it wasn’t on the same weekend,” says Masters. Instead, the fellowship now holds occasional smaller events for finalists.\n\nIn the early years, fellows needed more structure and guidance; they often lived together, and their attendance was expected at more frequent events. Because they were younger, and their projects were nascent and sometimes unwieldy, they needed more support with the basics. In addition to helping with tips on fundraising or hiring practices, the fellowship’s former directors also lent dating advice, advised on table manners, and generally played a more parental role. Now that the fellows are further along on their entrepreneurial endeavors from the outstart, their needs are different, and often fewer; a central draw for the most accomplished fellows — people like Leimgruber whose schedules are tight already — is that the fellowship won’t be work; it will help.\n\nThe central tenet to the contemporary version of the fellowship is that there are no real requirements. Masters and Abraham make themselves available to advise founders. Abraham keeps a rigid schedule and carves out set office hours to meet. Masters tends to be more fluid; fellows can text him, and he usually manages to get back to them within the day. “I have babies that wake up and yell in the night. So I am around to do email at 2 a.m.,” he said. Fellows receive books — and payments — in the mail each month, and the fellowship connects with them to see how things are going. The fellowship also holds regular informal dinners in San Francisco, and sometimes New York. But the fellows don’t have to come.\n\nMasters and Abraham also instituted some changes in the selection process. They added three years to the age limit so they could access stronger candidates. These days, they accept new fellows on a rolling basis, allowing the foundation to add a couple each month, and announce the full year’s fellows— now as many as 30 — each June. Early on, the application was onerous, including essays and test scores. “We’ve changed the application five times,” says Masters. “Each time, we decided it was really long, and cumbersome, and we weren’t getting the information we wanted.”\n\nThey got about 6,000 applications for this year’s fellowship, but 60 percent of the current crop of fellows didn’t apply. Instead, Masters and Abraham have tapped their networks for referrals, and recruited them. One such example is Boyan Slat, a long-haired European who founded The Ocean Cleanup at age 17 and became the youngest recipient ever to receive the UN’s highest environmental award. Slat presides over a team of more than 40 people at a Dutch foundation he started to develop technology to clean up the massive plastic garbage dump that rests atop the Pacific Ocean, between California and Hawaii. Masters met him last year when he came by the foundation to request a grant. Slat, now 22, seemed older than his years. Thiel’s team passed on the opportunity to fund him, but Masters remembered him. Earlier this year, when Slat was in San Francisco for a fundraising trip, they met up again. “I wasn’t expecting much but I took the meeting because of whoever introduced us,” says Masters. “Immediately, he was impressive.”\n\nMasters asked him if he would like to be a fellow. “He was a little bit like, ‘I didn’t apply. What’s going on?’” Masters remembers. But he accepted the fellowship, and the $100,000 grant became a donation to his foundation. (I reached out to Slat to learn more, and a spokesperson responded that he was too busy for an interview.)\n\nJack Abraham, executive director of the Thiel Fellowship Michelle Le\n\nThiel’s dinner party concluded abruptly at 9 p.m. He didn’t kick anyone out. But the food stopped coming out of the kitchen, and when I looked up, Thiel had absented himself. We continued to mill around for awhile. I saw Leimgruber, and edged my way over to say hello. He introduced me to Kieran O’Reilly, who’d left Harvard in 2014 to run his GIF-making company, and John Backus, a ’15 fellow who’d been one of Leimgruber’s Stanford roommates during his epic sophomore year, and now is a cofounder at the software identity company Blockscore.\n\nBy then, I’d known Leimgruber for a few weeks, and we’d discussed many facets of the fellowship. “C’mon, aren’t you going to ask about dropping out of school?” said Leimgruber. I took the bait.\n\n“Do people ask you guys that a lot?” I said. All three nodded.\n\n“It’s really the worst when school comes up,” Backus said. “It’s offensive, the way people ask about it.” Backus was a tall, highly likable guy with a slightly lopsided face and the hint of a lisp. He explained that none of the successful dropouts ever went back to school. Bill Gates didn’t go back. Mark Zuckerberg didn’t go back. To go back would imply personal failure. Why would he ever do that? He had his network started already, and clearly the opportunities came through the network.\n\nSure, I conceded, but what if his company failed?\n\nThere was a look he shot me then, a look I’d come to recognize. It was the look that said, you don’t get it. Maybe his idea wouldn’t work, he said, and his company would fail. That happened. But there would be a half-dozen more ideas that he’d reach for, and after that, a half-dozen more. Each idea was just practice for realizing the next idea. And thanks to Thiel, he’d know the people — funders, engineers, advisors — that could best help him translate those ideas into companies. Yes, he could go back to Stanford any time. But why would he ever turn away from the thing that he’d started to build, which was not a company, but a network — and start all over again? This network, he contended, was far more valuable than any he could build in college — even at Stanford.\n\nThiel set out to disrupt the existing educational institutions. He suggested he could do a better job at training a small cohort of gifted individuals, and that once free of the shackles of a conformist degree-making institution, these fellows would be capable of jumpstarting human progress. Fellows have not yet spurred the type of innovation that has led to flying cars. Or even, yet, 140 characters. Instead, Thiel has manufactured a pedigree that is starting to look, in many ways, as elite as the one he endeavored to replace. For a select group of already successful entrepreneurs, it’s the ultimate credential.",

        "text": "She’s probably mostly kidding when she tells the origin story this way, but Kathy Hudson—until last year the deputy director for science, outreach, and policy at the National Institutes of Health—says that a massive update to the NIH’s rules for funding science started with humiliation. A pal who ran approvals at the Food and Drug Administration, Hudson says, “used to walk around and talk about how NIH funded small, crappy trials, and they would say it at big gatherings.” This was Washington, in front of congresspeople—or at conferences full of leading researchers. “I would get so pissed off,” Hudson says.\n\nBut then, well, she took it to heart. “I started to look at our trials and what kinds of policies we had, to make sure investments in clinical trials were well spent,” Hudson says. It turned out they were not.\n\nThis week, after almost a decade of work, some new rules go into effect for researchers funded by NIH. If they’re using human beings in their experiments, most of them now have to register their methodologies on a government-built website, clinicaltrials.gov. They have to promise to share whatever they find, even if they don’t prove what they hoped—especially if they don’t prove it. They have to get trained up in modern clinical practices.\n\nPhilosophically, almost no one disagrees with the intent. Make science more open, more ethical, and smarter. But some researchers think the rule change will bring with it more than just confusing, possibly burdensome new bureaucracy, and maybe even set back all of basic bioscience. They’re just as pissed off as Hudson used to get.\n\nThe changes to the rules aren’t small-potatoes. The agency awards tens of thousands of grants, $17 billion in 2016; it’s a key source of money for US scientists and a primary driver of new biomedical knowledge. The process for getting one of those grants is competitive, whether you’re doing basic science or preliminary investigations or if you're doing giant clinical trials that attempt to figure out if a new drug or therapy cures a disease. “Clinical trials are super-special, because people are involved and at risk, and it matters,” Hudson says. “So we should make sure they’re really good.”\n\nThe new rules expand the definition of clinical trials to work with human subjects that didn’t used to be clinical. Yet the NIH’s bureaucratic requirements still ask for information on those experiments that maps onto the old definition. And much of that doesn’t apply to smaller studies. The point is, if a researcher has to figure all this out, they might just give up altogether—and not do the science.\n\nBack in the early 2010s, Hudson and Francis Collins, the director of the NIH, set out to get the clinical trial rules sorted. That meant trials had to be well-designed, with enough statistical power to answer the question they set out to, and researchers would have to pre-register those designs to make sure they didn’t try any shenanigans at the end—changing the thing they said they were trying to measure so their data looks more convincing. “We invest in clinical studies where we tell human beings, ‘your participation in this clinical study may not benefit you, but it will benefit other people because we will learn from your contribution.’” Hudson says. “Too frequently that is an outright, blatant lie. Something like 5 percent of all clinical studies terminate without generating any data.”\n\nSo another condition: Share the data, no matter what. “People, academics in particular, have an incentive system that rewards publication and getting grants,\" Hudson says. \"Posting data on clinicaltrials.gov is not a citable thing that you put on your CV.”\n\nNIH leadership was making an argument based on economics and ethics. “When it is research that involved human volunteers, regardless of whether they’re giving of their time or bodies or they’re engaged in higher-risk late-phase clinical trials, we had an ethical obligation to make sure those results saw the light of day,” says Carrie Wolinetz, Associate Director for Science Policy at the NIH. “Also, if you were to ask us—and Congress did—‘at any given time, NIH, how many clinical trials are you funding,’ we could actually answer those questions.”\n\nAs a bonus, the rules for pre-registering methodologies and sharing data also happen to meet the philosophical goals of Open Science, a set of principles designed to deal with science’s ongoing reproducibility crisis. Academic and social pressures—journals tend to only want to publish surprising, positive results (“hypothesis confirmed!”)—lead to bad science.\n\nAt least, that was the hypothesis.\n\nIn practice, when the research community started to understand what the new rules would mean, lots of people freaked out. They thought using the infrastructure for registering all-out clinical trials, and changing the definition of “clinical trial” to include, it seemed, every experiment with human beings, would mean basic research and simpler behavioral studies just wouldn’t get funding. In late 2017, more than 3,500 researchers signed a petition to the NIH asking that the new rules be delayed and rethought. “We support the goals of transparency and replicability. Unfortunately, the current effort to improve transparency and replicability in basic science does so by mislabeling basic research as a clinical trial,” the petition said.\n\nTheir fear was that even something as innocuous as monitoring a research subject’s stress levels would be an “intervention” in the eyes of an NIH grant review committee. Those kind of studies are a lot more potent than mere observation, but letters from the Association of Psychological Science and a crossover-sized team of academic university associations worried that redefining all human interventional science as clinical would mean lots of researchers would switch to those simpler observational studies.\n\nEveryone mostly agreed that transparency, ethics, and openness were good goals. But the resources available to a big, multi-year, multicenter trial to deal with burdensome bureaucracy are very different than a small, non-clinical lab. “The use of the term ‘clinical trial,’ this was just a huge distraction. There is a sense in science of what that means, and basic scientists really didn’t think of their research as being that,” says Brian Nosek, a psychologist at the University of Virginia and founder of the Center for Open Science, a major advocate of pre-registration and data sharing.\n\nIn a big clinical trial, “people say, that’s one study that occurs over five years. I run five studies a day,” Nosek says. “It’s a massive administrative burden where we have to start from scratch every time and fill out a wealth of forms.”\n\nPolicymakers at the NIH didn’t go back to square one, but they did try to spread the word. Over the last year or so, case studies and explainers have clogged up the NIH website. Some of the concerns of the community got taken care of. It seems like studies that don’t fill in all the fields of the registration documents, if they’re not applicable, won’t get dinged.\n\nOther details got smoothed over, if not entirely ironed out. After much back and forth, for example, studies using fMRI to study brain function won’t be counted as clinical trials, says Nancy Kanwisher, a neuroscientist at MIT and an early critic of the new rules. Studies that use fMRI to guide surgery, say, or evaluate whether a drug works? Those are clinical trials. “This is sensible and a huge relief,” Kanwisher says, but argues that the process has been \"dysfunctional.\" “The failure of NIH officials to consult with people in the field before implementing the policy was a serious mistake that has wasted the time of hundreds of scientists for months.”\n\nThe folks who put together the new policy deny that. “There was a workshop early on to get input. There was a public comment period,” Hudson emails. “We talked about it all the time in conferences etc. We did user groups to help make the interface for inputting data more user friendly. Not sure what specific input we missed.”\n\nOne thing that might make the new registration rules less onerous: alternatives simpler than the government’s clinicaltrials.gov website. That could be where Nosek’s Open Science Framework comes in. OSF is already trying to develop templates for pre-registration and data sharing. Nosek wrote one of a half-dozen letters explaining and critiquing the new NIH policy in this week’s issue of Nature Human Behaviour,1 which also ran a Q&A between Mike Lauer, NIH’s Deputy Director for Extramural Research, and FABBS past president Jeremy Wolfe, another outspoken opponent. They mostly agreed to disagree.\n\nWith the policy in effect starting this week, and with a new round of grant applications due soon, nobody is entirely sure what the shakedown cruise will look like. “Ironically, researchers are being urged to contact NIH staff to help them determine what is and what is not a clinical trial,” says Sarah Brookhart, executive director of the Association for Psychological Science, “a question no one had a problem answering until now.”\n\nNew, broad policy changes are rare and disconcerting. “I hope that we will get them on board. Once this goes into place, perhaps some of the burden concerns will be relieved. If there are obvious pain points, we’re going to keep our eye on that,” Wolinetz says. “It is an unknown question how this impacts the enterprise. Ideally we will be better able to manage our portfolio. Does that change what we invest in? That remains to be seen.”\n\n1 1/26/18 5:36 AM Changed to correct journal title",

        "text": "This January, a group of four scientists sat quietly in a windowless classroom in a two-story, brick block of a building on the campus of Washington University. The weather in St. Louis was grey, cold. Someone had arranged the rectangular desks into something approximating a circle. All eyes were on a black-haired, spectacled man at the front of the room.\n\n“We encourage the use of first names only,” he said. “Let’s go around the circle and promise to hold everything we say in this workshop as strictly confidential. I’ll start: ‘My name is Jim...’”\n\nAnother voice echoed the oath. “My name is John,” said a man, a biochemist whose name is not in fact John. “And I promise to hold everything we say in this workshop as strictly confidential.” One by one, the other scientists in the circle repeated the mantra.\n\nThe man we’ll call John Smith and the other scientists hadn’t come to St. Louis to discuss the latest findings in their field, or be trained in a new lab technique. They came from very different fields and had little interest in each other’s work. Something else had brought them together: These scientists had each done something wrong. And Jim DuBois, the spectacled man swearing everyone to secrecy, was there to make sure they never did again.\n\nDuBois’ program is sometimes described as “researcher rehab,” though he does not condone the nickname. The scientists who come to his three-day Professionalism and Integrity workshop have made a mistake: anything from incorrect paperwork for animal experiments to a falsified image, faked data, or plagiarism. Not fireable offenses, but serious enough—or frequent enough—that the researcher’s institution wants a change.\n\nHigh-profile scientific deviants periodically make headlines: Haruko Obokata was hailed as a star when she claimed to have triggered stem cell-like behavior in normal cells, until an investigation concluded she’d manipulated her experiments and falsified results. Michael LaCour seemed to have finally figured out how to change people’s minds on gay marriage—but actually he’d faked his survey data. Thoracic surgeon Paolo Macchiarini developed a plastic tube to replace the trachea, operating on nine patients before it was revealed he’d never properly tested the device. Seven of his transplant recipients have since died.\n\nIn 1992, in response to several high-profile cases of fraud in federally funded research, the Department of Health and Human Services created the federal Office of Research Integrity to investigate the most serious allegations of research misconduct. They receive about 200 reports a year, handled by a highly specialized team of investigators—experts in detecting image doctoring and recovering hidden data.\n\nBut only the most egregious cases make it to the office’s door, and only the ones that involve federally funded medical research. And while grand-scale, criminally minded deceptions are titillating, they're rare. The more common problems—just as damaging to science’s reputation, in the aggregate—are the pedestrian indiscretions: plagiarism, image doctoring, data a little too carefully groomed.\n\nAnd so the majority of scientific misdeeds are handled in-house, as quietly as possible, by the scientist’s institution. Which is where DuBois comes in.\n\nGetty Images\n\nIntroduction to Ethics\n\nResearcher rehab begins with a belief: that behind any academic misdeed is a complex story of rights and wrongs, good intentions and extenuating circumstances. Science strives to iron out the wrinkles of life with methodical experimentation and repetition. But it’s still humans that have to do that work—so the wrinkles never entirely disappear.\n\nDuBois, a professor in the department of medicine at Washington University, is a philosopher and psychologist by training, and he’s spent most of his career pondering the ethics of research and medicine. He co-wrote and edited a book of case studies in research ethics and founded a journal that collects patient stories about ethically sensitive issues, like gender reassignment surgery for intersex children.\n\nOver more than a decade in the field, DuBois developed a reputation on campus as a research ethics authority, and administrators started pointing problematic scientists to his office for a talking-to. The story was always the same, DuBois remembers: “We've got this one researcher who is causing a bit of trouble and we've tried to work with them, but he keeps breaking the rules.” As part of an action plan, they’d ask DuBois to work with them for a certain number of hours.\n\nHe turned them away every time.\n\nDespite his expertise, DuBois couldn’t think of anything he could say to “fix” these scientists’ behavior. He knew from his research that integrity trainings—commonly used as preventative measures by academic institutions—have almost no impact on scientists’ future behavior.\n\nHe kept saying no, for more than a decade. But then, in 2011, DuBois saw an announcement for a grant from NIH to develop new research ethics training programs, and he began to think he might be missing an opportunity to innovate. There was obviously an unmet need. Maybe working with the very scientists he had been sending away—the people who had already broken the rules—was the best opportunity to create better scientists. After all, who would be more motivated to change than a scientist fresh out of a humiliating and time-consuming investigation?\n\nEighteen months later, in January of 2013, DuBois was meeting his inaugural class of scientific miscreants. He had worked with a team of psychologists and research integrity experts to create a program that would be more like group therapy than traffic school. He’s now held 12 sessions, training over 52 researchers from 33 different institutions. Smith and his cohort were in group number 11.\n\nGetty Images\n\nOrigin Stories\n\nThe bagels and fruit on the back table sat uneaten as Smith and the other scientists introduced themselves in turn. “This is not an ethics course,” DuBois told the three scientists in his barren classroom. “We will not teach the basic rules for the responsible conduct of research.” Instead, they would together try to identify the obstacles keeping each scientist from following the rules, and the skills that could guide better decision-making.\n\nAfter everyone swore to keep the proceedings secret, DuBois posed a question to the group: “Why did you become a scientist?”\n\nSmith spoke up. He had been a scientist for as long as he could remember, he said—doing math problems for fun, driving his parents crazy by taking apart anything he could get his hands on. He just wanted to understand how the world works. When he made his first significant scientific discovery—a new protein modification technique—as a biochemistry graduate student, it was thrilling. Now he headed his own lab, with a squadron of graduate students and staff making the discoveries for him.\n\nSmith sat on his plastic chair and listened as the other offenders shared their scientific origin stories. For hours, DuBois gently steered the conversation, drawing out the unspoken rules, culture, and bias that had shaped each of the scientists’ labs. At one point, he pulled out a biometric device and passed it around, teaching everyone how to manage stress by monitoring their heart rate.\n\nAround 4:30, the day’s programming was finished and the sun was starting to set outside, though no one in the windowless room had noticed. DuBois gave the group some homework: Write down an honest version of the events that landed you here.\n\nSmith took an hour-long Uber ride to his discount motel, sat at the built-in particleboard desk, looked around at the '70s-style orange and brown décor, and silently told himself the story.\n\nHe was grateful to have his own lab, but over time, he had started feeling overwhelmed by his mountain of administrative duties. Smith’s research required human subjects, and experiments on humans are approved and monitored by an ethics board. The board evaluates every step of an experiment to make sure the people involved are treated safely and fairly. The process was sometimes more stressful than useful. He wasn’t always as diligent as he should have been.\n\nThen, during one project, Smith mishandled a human protocol. He was studying two groups of people with two similar diseases, and published the results of both groups as one paper when they should have been kept separate. His oversight board discovered the discrepancy in an audit.\n\nThe next day, listening to the others' stories, Smith realized their mistakes could easily have been his. They were the kinds of slip-ups he imagined most scientists make at some point—and he wasn’t wrong. Questionable research practices are far more prevalent than the program’s small group of four would suggest. In a 2005 survey of over 3,000 scientists, more than a third of respondents admitted to at least one form of dubious conduct, including 6 percent of participants who self-reported “failing to present data that contradicts one’s own previous research.” Nearly 8 percent said they had circumvented “certain minor aspects of human-subject requirements.”\n\nTogether, DuBois’ group spent most of the second day processing their stories. And on the third day, DuBois helped the scientists come up with a plan. They could hold regular meetings with lab staff and students, or create a standard operating protocol for data management. “I try to ask everyone before they leave, ‘Is this going to happen again?” DuBois says. “What if next time someone makes up data in your lab, it’s discovered because you caught it?”\n\nWhen Smith went home, he started implementing new procedures so important details won’t slip by—or at least that’s what he and his institution hope. This is DuBois’ goal for all scientists: practical processes and cognitive skills to manage the complexity and intense pressures of research, so that the rules and norms governing science—IRBs, thoughtful data review—are easier to respect. Although that’s not the only upshot: The training is also an insurance policy for researchers and their universities, a way to demonstrate they're taking real action.\n\nNichelle Cobb, director of the Institutional Review Boards office at the University of Wisconsin, has referred three researchers to the program. To her, it functions as a wake-up call for errant scientists: “One of the things that the program does is encourage some self reflection,” she says. “A lot of researchers are very successful, very driven people, but they might not have necessarily ever been taught certain skills.” Spending a few days discussing their own weaknesses and getting the management skills to deal with them is usually a positive experience, and she’s seen it lead to better, less combative relationships between scientists and their oversight committees.\n\nDuBois isn’t under any illusions that his students will never make a mistake again, or that Smith’s new strategies will be foolproof. But hopefully, next time—if there is a next time—Smith won’t see himself as a victim who mishandled an overly burdensome review process. He'll value the rules, and welcome the correction.\n\nGetty Images\n\nBad Apples\n\nNot everyone agrees scientists should get a second chance at integrity. DuBois’ program is covered by in publications aimed at scientists; places like Nature, Science, and Retraction Watch. DuBois’ main message to the scientific community in these publications is “This could easily happen to you.” That message is not always well received.\n\n“The amount of hate mail they receive in response is shocking,” DuBois says. “When scientists think about scientists, they want their heroes and villains, and they don't want to think that the people who've screwed up are actually way more like they are.” The comments section gets heated: “Just eject them from the system altogether.” “Throw out the bad apples.” “Why spend even more money on cheaters?” “Boot the cheating slimebags.” Here, the misbehaving scientists are not like everybody else: They’re tainting science’s reputation and stealing ever-rarer grant money from their worthy peers. “Instead of spending money on people who know better and choose not to do the right thing, bar them from public funding for LONG terms,” read one typical response to a Retraction Watch post about the program.\n\nIn a strange way, scarce resources are the motivating factor for both those angry commenters and the scientists they rail against. In DuBois’ surveys of his workshop participants, 72 percent of them said the ultimate cause of their lapse was because they weren’t paying attention, often because they were over-extended and under-staffed. That presents one major criticism of DuBois’ approach: that he’s focusing on fixing individual scientists instead of the environment they operate in.\n\n“Scientists operate in the context of their direct environment, and also in the context of broader science system,” says Coosje Veldkamp, a doctoral student at the Tilburg University Meta-Research Center who studies methods aimed at reducing human error in science. “Anything that happened from pressures or lots of stress, if those factors don’t change then I think it’s very hard for scientists to just change their own individual behavior.” Plus, she adds, there’s still more speculation than science about what leads to questionable research practices. She thinks it’s important to conduct that research before diving into rehab-like training programs.\n\nScientific culture can beget misconduct in other ways. Plagiarism—one of the most common forms of bad behavior—often stems from graduate students from other countries who don’t even know it’s wrong, according to John Dahlberg, who recently retired as the deputy director of the Office of Research Integrity. Indeed, over half the scientists who have participated in DuBois’ program were born outside of the United States, roughly twice what would be expected based on the demographics of American scientists. Dahlberg generally agrees with DuBois’ philosophy that one bad decision doesn’t make someone a bad scientist—but not everyone in the ORI shares this position. Last year, six of the office’s eight investigators threatened to resign over conflicts with the new director, Kathy Partin, partly because she wanted to focus more on plagiarism.\n\nConsider the case of Boris Kosharskyy. In 2015, Ukranian Kosharskyy had been working as an anesthesiologist at the Albert Einstein School of Medicine for about five years. He was a productive scientist, frequently publishing papers and book chapters. One day, his department chair forwarded him an email from the editor of a journal where Kosharskyy had published a paper almost 10 years ago.\n\n“It came to my attention a fraudulent paper was published in this journal….” the email read. Parts of Kosharskyy’s paper had been plagiarized, and the article would need to be retracted. Kosharskyy was as shocked by this as anyone—the paper was over a decade old, and he certainly didn’t remember misusing someone else’s work. But there it was: several paragraphs from another paper, no quotation marks. A junior high schooler could see it was plagiarism.\n\nKosharskyy thinks it was his co-author, not him, who slipped the offending paragraphs in. But the co-author was no longer in academia, so Kosharskyy took the blame. The Einstein investigation was a lonely experience. “I didn't have anyone to talk to about it, and no one could help me through the process,” Kosharskyy says. “It was a very painful year and a half.” His dean assured him that this wasn’t the first plagiarism case he’d dealt with, but none of Kosharkyy’s colleagues stepped forward to share their experience with him. He assumed they were too ashamed to even mention it.\n\n“I was trying to find an attorney to represent me because I thought there would be some kind of hearing,” Kosharskyy says. “The attorney’s fee was $1,000 an hour, and I started thinking we should probably sell the house.” He soon learned there wouldn’t be a criminal trial, but he would need to fork over several thousand dollars and spend a few of his vacation days in St. Louis. His institution wanted him to go to rehab.\n\nAt first Kosharskyy resented the cost and the lost vacation time. But as soon as the actual workshop started and he could talk to other people about what he’d been through, those feelings were replaced with relief.\n\n“No one was saying ‘Oh my god, why did you do this?’ That was just not on the table. It was more like, ‘Let's see if we can correct it, if we can make it better in the future,’” Kosharskyy says. “‘Let’s see if we can improve and change the culture.’” The program helped him come to terms with what happened, and he’s now one of the few participants who’s gone public with his experience.\n\nAfter he came back from St. Louis, Kosharskyy excitedly planned a seminar on plagiarism, part of an early morning series that takes place at 7 am. Normally, “people are just sleeping,” Kosharskyy says. But this seminar was different. “People were actually taking pictures of my slides, and they were asking questions, and when it was done they were meeting me in the hallway to ask me more questions.” Now he’s organizing a panel to discuss plagiarism at the next meeting of the National Association of Anesthesiologists, to share what he’s learned. “I now use software to double check the end result, and give lectures to residents and medical students before we even start,” Kosharskyy says. “I'm trying to create a culture of responsibility.”\n\nGetty Images\n\nSurvey Says\n\nKosharskyy is a model student, and a great spokesperson. But his story doesn’t prove that researcher rehab works. If his version of events is true, and he’s not the one who copied words into his publication, his proactive work to prevent plagiarism doesn’t tell you much about researchers who really need help. It doesn’t even tell you about the program’s effect on middle-of-the-road offenders like Smith, whose impropriety stems from lapsed attention to detail. Do DuBois’ students actually become more truthful, careful scientists?\n\nDuBois recognizes that efforts to change scientists’ behavior have a history of failure—sometimes, they even make behavior worse. On the morning before his first workshop, he found himself replaying conversations with colleagues who helped him design the workshop. Should he have separated the researchers by seniority, so people who’d been “cheating” their whole career wouldn’t “corrupt” more innocent, younger scientists? What if he was just burnishing bad apples and throwing them back in the bin?\n\nThe truth was, DuBois wasn’t sure it was a good idea. He didn’t know much about the scientists he would be trying to re-program. What if they were bad apples? Sitting in his car, with just a few minutes left before the class would begin, he decided to try a stress-management breathing exercise—the same one he would later teach to Smith and his group. DuBois inhaled deeply and watched his heart rate start to slow on a biofeedback device he’d brought in for demonstration. Five minutes later, a little calmer, he got out of the car and went in to meet his pupils for the first time.\n\nSince then, DuBois has come to believe that the program does have an impact on his students. Like any good scientist, DuBois won’t rely on anecdata. He and his co-instructors conduct follow-up surveys and phone calls to track whether their students report statistically significant behavioral changes (the results of these surveys will be published some time next month). Also like any good scientist, DuBois is quick to point out the limitations of these results: no control group, and the data is self-reported.\n\nBut with or without solid evidence, he’s confident enough in his work’s effectiveness that he’s hoping to export the curriculum to other countries, and double the offerings in St. Louis to six times a year. He knows there are more scientists who could use his help.\n\nSmith agrees. “The rules are there for a purpose,” he says, “and you need to appreciate the purpose is real.” Since he got back from St. Louis, he’s been trying to share his new perspective with the rest of the lab, even designating one member of his lab to be an internal compliance czar.\n\nRecently, Smith was getting ready to start a new experiment with a colleague, and he found himself doing some teaching of his own. “Whenever we do something, we have to think about ‘What’s the worst case scenario that could happen?’” he said to his colleague. “‘Assume that happens, how would that affect the people who we're working with?’” Before DuBois’ workshop, “I would have just said, ‘Just make sure you follow the rules,’ and that would have been the end of it,” Smith says.\n\nDuBois concluded the twelfth session of the workshop this month, sending another group of (maybe) reformed researchers out of St. Louis. He’ll greet the next class in September, ready to swear them to secrecy before they together battle the scientific method's undercurrent of human fallibility.",

        "text": "On Amazon, customer comments can help a product surge in popularity. The online retail giant says that more than 99 percent of its reviews are legitimate because they are written by real shoppers who aren’t paid for them.\n\nBut a Washington Post examination found that for some popular product categories, such as Bluetooth headphones and speakers, the vast majority of reviews appear to violate Amazon’s prohibition on paid reviews. Such reviews have certain characteristics, such as repetitive wording that people probably cut and paste in.\n\nMany of these fraudulent reviews originate on Facebook, where sellers seek shoppers on dozens of networks, including Amazon Review Club and Amazon Reviewers Group, to give glowing feedback in exchange for money or other compensation. The practice artificially inflates the ranking of thousands of products, experts say, misleading consumers.\n\nAmazon.com banned paying for reviews a year and a half ago because of research it conducted showing that consumers distrust paid reviews. Every once in a while, including this month, Amazon purges shoppers from its site whom it accuses of breaking its policies.\n\nBut the ban, sellers and experts say, merely pushed an activity that used to take place openly into dispersed and harder-to-track online communities.\n\nThere, an economy of paid reviews has flourished. Merchants pledge to drop reimbursements into a reviewer’s PayPal account within minutes of posting comments for items such as kitchen knives, rain ponchos or shower caddies, often sweetening the deal with a $5 commission or a $10 Amazon gift card. Facebook this month deleted more than a dozen of the groups where sellers and buyers matched after being contacted by The Post. Amazon kicked a five-star seller off its site after an inquiry from The Post.\n\n“These days it is very hard to sell anything on Amazon if you play fairly,” said Tommy Noonan, who operates ReviewMeta, a website that helps consumers spot suspicious Amazon reviews. “If you want your product to be competitive, you have to somehow manufacture reviews.”\n\nSellers say the flood of inauthentic reviews makes it harder for them to compete legitimately and can crush profits. “It’s devastating, devastating,” said Mark Caldeira, owner of the baby-products company Mayapple Baby. He said his product rankings have plummeted in the past year and a half, attributing it to competitors using paid reviews. “We just can’t keep up.”\n\nSuspicious or fraudulent reviews are crowding out authentic ones in some categories, The Post found using ReviewMeta data. ReviewMeta examines red flags, such as an unusually large number of reviews that spike over a short period of time or “sock puppet” reviewers who appear to have cut and pasted stock language.\n\nFor example, of the 47,846 total reviews for the first 10 products listed in an Amazon search for “bluetooth speakers,” two-thirds were problematic, based on calculations using the ReviewMeta tool. So were more than half of the 32,435 reviews for the top 10 Bluetooth headphones listed.\n\nDiet pills and other supplements also generated large numbers of problematic reviews. Just 33 percent of the reviews for the top 10 testosterone boosters listed on Amazon appeared legitimate, and only 44 percent of reviews for the top listed weight-loss pills, according to data crunched from ReviewMeta.\n\nIncentivized reviewers give higher ratings than nonpaid reviewers, according to ReviewMeta. The result is that consumers could unknowingly be purchasing poorer-quality products.\n\n“I don’t like to be taken advantage of,” said Eric Hall, 53, a research chemist in Minneapolis and an Amazon Prime customer who no longer trusts five-star reviews. He sees them as a marker of likely fraud rather than excellence.\n\nAmazon says it aggressively polices its platform for incentivized reviews. Amazon has filed five lawsuits since 2015 against people who write paid reviews and companies that solicit them.\n\n“We know that millions of customers make informed buying decisions everyday using Customer Reviews,” an Amazon spokeswoman, Angie Newman, said in a statement. “We take this responsibility very seriously and defend the integrity of reviews by taking aggressive action to protect customers from dishonest parties who are abusing the reviews system. . . . We take forceful action against both reviewers and sellers by suppressing reviews that violate our guidelines and suspend, ban or pursue legal action against these bad actors.”\n\nMing Ooi, chief strategy officer for Fakespot, a review auditing site that analyzes comments, similar to ReviewMeta, said that “the issue with fake or unreliable reviews has not subsided at all but likely is worsening.”\n\nProblems with the authenticity of Amazon reviews come at a moment of broad public concern over the accuracy of information on platforms built by Silicon Valley. The spread of Russian disinformation and hoaxes on YouTube and Facebook has raised questions about the role of technology platforms in displaying and amplifying falsehoods, contributing to a climate of distrust and social division.\n\nAmazon has escaped the scrutiny of its peers. But the same social-network effects that enable misinformation also increasingly distort online commerce. Social media has accelerated the practice of online reviewing because of its power to bring together groups of people who gather for a specific purpose, such as rating Uber drivers.\n\nA Facebook spokeswoman, Rebecca Maas, said in an email: “We are committed to increasing the good and minimizing the bad across Facebook. . . . There are many legitimate groups on Facebook related to online commerce, but the groups identified misuse our platform.” Facebook would not disclose which groups it removed.\n\nSellers say that Amazon’s position as the top e-commerce destination has spawned a race to master — and game — the company’s systems. More than half of all online product searches start on Amazon, according to survey data by the digital marketing firm BloomReach. Landing among the first 10 results on an Amazon search can drive an explosion in sales, according to sellers.\n\nAmazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos first championed the idea of showcasing customer reviews on his online bookstore in 1995, helping spread the notion that consumers make smarter choices shopping online than in brick-and-mortar stores because tech platforms enable them to instantly access the opinions of fellow shoppers. That paved the way for review-based sites such as Yelp, Uber and Airbnb.\n\nBut the vision Bezos popularized, of a review and ratings system that serves as a guide for consumers to make smarter choices, has given way to a system in which some consumers are manipulated and misled. (Bezos is the owner of The Post.)\n\nAmazon rankings are the new “battlefield” for online manipulation, said Renee DiResta, policy lead for the nonprofit Data for Democracy, a group of technology researchers dedicated to promoting integrity online. She has conducted research on paid Amazon reviews by joining some of the Facebook groups. “There’s a dark side to the race for the stars,” she said.\n\nHow Amazon comes up with its star ratings is a closely guarded secret. On its website, Amazon says it uses a machine learning model that takes many factors into account, including the age of a review, helpfulness votes by customers and whether reviews are from verified purchasers. Reviews are a minor factor in the overall rating, Amazon said, but it would not quantify their weighting.\n\nThe company said it uses artificial intelligence to analyze “hundreds of thousands” of Amazon customers who have been banned from leaving reviews and uses the data collected to build computer models of their behavior to predict future techniques.\n\nThe auditing sites use a software algorithm that scrapes Amazon’s website for suspicious patterns or attributes of the review or the reviewer. ReviewMeta then gives the product a new star rating based only on the reviews its system deems likely to be authentic. For example, deleting the suspicious reviews on a pair of wireless headphones from Atgoin dropped its rating from 4.4 stars to 2.6.\n\nReviewMeta and Fakespot say the ease of detecting potentially fraudulent reviews makes them wonder why Amazon isn’t more stringent.\n\nFor two decades, Amazon permitted incentivized reviews, as long as reviewers disclosed that they had received a free or discounted product. But it began cracking down on the practice in 2015, acknowledging its struggles to control it.\n\n“Despite substantial efforts to stamp out the practice,” company lawyers wrote in a lawsuit, “an unhealthy ecosystem is developing outside of Amazon to supply inauthentic reviews.”\n\nAround the same time, Amazon began courting foreign sellers to sell products directly on its site. The move drastically worsened the problem of scamming, experts say, because competing on price and padding reviews were a way for Chinese manufacturers to go up against entrenched brands that are well known to American consumers.\n\nAtgoin, an electronics company based in Shenzen, China, was one such company that leapfrogged to the top of Amazon rankings. In November, its $30 headphones had just a handful of reviews. Then, over a five-day period in December, the product received nearly 300 reviews, almost all of which gave five stars.\n\nThe ReviewMeta analysis found that more than 90 percent of all the reviews for the Atgoin headphones were suspicious. Many featured repeat phrases, including “I’ll be using this for my gym workout going forward” and “comfortable to wear.” By early February, the Atgoin headphones, which had 927 reviews, appeared at the top in non-sponsored search results.\n\nIt is unclear how Atgoin obtained the flood of positive reviews. Atgoin on its website says it offers consumers “free and exclusively discounted samples” in return for “your valued, honest feedback” — language that Amazon said broke its policies. Atgoin did not respond to a request for comment through its Amazon seller page or its website. After The Post’s queries, Amazon removed Atgoin as a seller.\n\nAmazon’s ban has not cut down on paid reviews so much as pushed them into the shadows, say sellers and researchers.\n\nIn February, there were nearly 100 Facebook groups, split up by geographic region and by product categories, in which Amazon merchants actively solicited consumers to write paid reviews. One such group had over 50,000 Facebook members until Facebook deleted it after The Post’s inquiry. There are also Reddit boards and YouTube tutorials that coach people on how to write reviews. Websites with names such as Slickdeals and JumpSend let merchants give out discounted products, using a loophole to get around Amazon’s ban.\n\nMerchants seeking to defraud Amazon have flocked to Facebook in particular, DiResta said.\n\nLast year, DiResta began studying and joining Amazon reviewer groups on Facebook. Her first act in the groups was to write “interested” next to a post describing a pair of Bluetooth headphones for $35.99. Almost immediately, a Facebook user purportedly named SC Li sent her a direct message, calling her “dear” and asking for a link to her Amazon profile. If she reviewed the headphones, SC Li said, he would reimburse her via her PayPal account.\n\nWithin an hour of getting SC Li’s message, DiResta got a slew of direct messages from other sellers, asking her to review tea lights, containers, shower caddies, badge holders, sanding discs, rain ponchos, pocket-size vanity mirrors and butterfly knives. The messages came in so quickly, she said, she barely had time to respond.\n\nDiResta spent three months monitoring the groups. She observed the sellers using tactics to avoid detection by Amazon, such as focusing on reviewers who have a long history of writing Amazon reviews. The sellers asked her for screen images showing when she started her profile.\n\nDiResta found that many of the Facebook accounts had no friends on the social network. Their only Facebook posts were about cheap products, and their profile pictures included stock photos. A reverse image search on SC Li’s profile photo, of a man on a beach, for example, revealed a stock photo called “seaside man” that appeared on various Chinese-language lifestyle websites, an indication of a fake profile.\n\nReviewers “just see it as a way to make extra money,” DiResta said. “The question is why doesn’t Amazon crack down more? These communities are not a secret.”",

        "text": "Amazon suggests you buy a lot of things, but it’s proably best not to follow the advice. David Ryder/Getty Images\n\nWhen you go to Amazon to buy something, Amazon will suggest other products that are “frequently bought together.” This feature can be practical—if you’re buying a Swiffer Wet Jet, it’s probably wise to pick up the cleaning fluid it uses, too—or just strange. But as an investigation from a British television station pointed out Monday, sometimes Amazon’s suggestions can amount to a deadly combination.\n\nA team from Channel 4 News found that Amazon has been prompting customers looking to buy “a common chemical used in food production” to also purchase other ingredients that, together, could be used to produce black powder. (The report did not specify exactly which ingredients, for obvious reasons.) Further down the page, according to the report, Amazon also nudged the customer to buy ball bearings, which can be used as shrapnel in homemade explosives.\n\nAmazon has responded by saying it’s reviewing its website to make sure that products are “presented in an appropriate manner.” Still, the report comes at a time of heightened fear of terrorist attacks in the U.K. On Friday, a homemade bomb left in a plastic bucket detonated on a crowded train car in London, injuring 30 people. It was the fifth terrorist attack in Britain this year.\n\nThough the “frequently bought together” items on Amazon aren’t illegal on their own, the Channel 4 News report noted that there have been successful prosecutions in the U.K. against people who buy chemicals that can be combined to make a bomb.\n\nAmazon’s “frequently bought together” suggestions are generated algorithmically. Which puts Amazon a growing list of major tech companies currently under fire for relying on algorithms that surface troubling results. On Sept. 14, ProPublica released a report detailing how Facebook lets advertisers target ads directly to people who describe themselves as “Jew haters” or are interested in the topic of “how to burn Jews.” Slate took the investigation further, finding Facebook suggested we send ads to users interested in topics like “killing bitches,” “threesome rape,” and “killing Haji.” BuzzFeed also found that Google’s ad targeting tool suggested ad buyers consider targeting users with topics like “black people ruin neighborhoods” and “Jewish control of banks.” Google and Facebook have both said that they are working to change how they let advertisers target users.\n\nThe whole point of algorithms is that they work on their own, so that Amazon doesn’t need to hire a person to sit there and think of items that might go well together. But that hands-free design doesn’t excuse Amazon, or any other tech company, from keeping a close eye on how its automated systems work in practice.",

They include Seattle, WA, Spokane, WA, and Portland, OR in the Northwest; Phoenix, AZ, Salt Lake City, UT, Provo, UT, Houston, TX, Fort Worth, TX, Plano, TX, and Austin, TX in the Southwest; Troy, MI, Warren, MI, Detroit, MI, and Kansas City, MO in the Midwest; and Pittsburgh, PA in the Northeast. Additional smaller counties—especially in ID, WI, and UT—also stand out for their high exemption rates.\n\nWe analyzed the relationship between NME rates and actual vaccine coverage, and found an inverse association between NME rate and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine coverage of kindergarteners in these states (P = 0.03 by Spearman correlation), indicating that states with higher overall NME rates do in fact have lower MMR vaccine coverage (P = 0.007 by beta regression).\n\nOur findings indicate that new foci of antivaccine activities are being established in major metropolitan areas, rendering select cities vulnerable for vaccination-preventable diseases. As noted by the recent experience in Anaheim, California, low vaccination rates resulted in a measles outbreak. In contrast, state closure of NMEs has resulted in an increase of MMR coverage.\n\nAccording to the 2015 National Immunization Survey, only 72.2% of children aged 19 to 35 months in the United States were fully vaccinated as per guidelines from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [1]. Due to parental concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy, many families choose to opt out their children from vaccinations required for school entry by obtaining nonmedical exemptions (NMEs) based on religious or philosophical beliefs. In 2016, 18 states permitted NMEs due to philosophical beliefs [2]. A detailed analysis of NMEs within each of the 18 states reveals that several counties, including those with large metropolitan areas, are at high risk for vaccine-preventable pediatric infection epidemics.\n\nThe rise in NMEs in 12 of 18 US states NME data were collected from all 18 states currently permitting philosophical-belief NMEs (Arkansas [AR], Arizona [AZ], Colorado [CO], Idaho [ID], Louisiana [LA], Maine [ME], Michigan [MI], Minnesota [MN], Missouri [MO], North Dakota [ND], Ohio [OH], Oklahoma [OK], Oregon [OR], Pennsylvania [PA], Texas [TX], Utah [UT], Washington [WA], and Wisconsin [WI]). Of note, MO permits philosophical-belief exemptions only for child care facilities, but not public schools. Sixteen of the 18 states also allow religious exemptions, except LA and MN: “The existing statute in Minnesota and Louisiana does not explicitly recognize religion as a reason for claiming an exemption; however, as a practical matter, the non-medical exemption may encompass religious beliefs” [2]. VT, CA, MS, and WV were excluded from our analysis because they no longer have NMEs in their respective states. From our 18 included states, state-level data were collected from state health departments and/or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [3] and analyzed by school year from 2009–2010 to 2016–2017. The state NME rate is represented by the number of entering kindergarteners with a documented NME out of the total kindergarten enrollments in the state. Specifically, the data were obtained from CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report’s (MMWR) annual reports (AR, AZ, CO, ID, LA, ME, MI, MN, MO, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, TX, UT, WA, and WI) and state health departments (AR, AZ, ID, LA, MI, MO, ND, OR, PA, and UT). CDC data from the 2010 to 2011 school year was not available for analysis; however, 10 of the 18 states individually provided data for the 2010 to 2011 school year. Because all data are represented as aggregated totals and not personally identifying, an exemption was obtained from the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board for this study. From our analysis, 12 of the 18 states permitting religious and philosophical-belief NMEs demonstrated an overall upward trend of enrolling kindergarteners with NMEs since 2009: AR, AZ, ID, ME, MN, MO, ND, OH, OK, OR, TX, and UT (Fig 1). All 12 states had a P < 0.05 by Mann-Kendall trend test. In general, the average rate of NMEs appears to have accelerated the most between the years 2009 and 2014, with some states exhibiting a plateau over the last 3 years. However, in states such as AR, ND, OH, OK, TX, UT, and others, the rates of NMEs continue to climb to the present day.

Whereas measles was thought to have been eliminated from the US in 2000, we have seen local outbreaks of this vaccine-preventable disease and others, like measles and pertussis (whooping cough), in recent years due to inadequate immunization coverage in schools. For instance, a child with an NME from the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 35 times more likely to contract measles than is a vaccinated child [4]. Moreover, a child without the diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine is 3 times more likely to contract pertussis than is a vaccinated child [5]. NMEs weaken herd immunity that protects the population at large, particularly children who are unable to get vaccinated for medical reasons. The target vaccination coverage rate to achieve the ideal herd immunity is 90% to 95%, depending on the infectious agent [6]. To evaluate the influence of NMEs on vaccine uptake, Spearman correlation was calculated between state NME rate (%) and MMR vaccination rate (%) for 20 states either allowing NMEs (OK was excluded due to lack of MMR vaccine data) or 3 control states prohibiting NMEs in the 2016 to 2017 school year (CA, MS, WV) (CDC MMWR annual report) using R programming language (version 3.4.2) with the “cor.test” function. As shown in Fig 4 and Table 3, there was a significant inverse association between state NME rate and MMR vaccination rate by Spearman correlation (P = 0.03; Fig 4) and beta regression (P = 0.007). Similarly, we calculated Spearman correlation between state NME rate and MMR rate for all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. States with no information for either NME rate or MMR vaccination rate were excluded (CO, IL, MN, MO, OK, and WY). From this analysis, we found a significant inverse association between state NME rate and MMR vaccination rate (P = 0.04) as compared to states allowing NMEs. Overall, states with more NME students exhibited lower MMR vaccination rates. In contrast, states that have banned NMEs—MS, CA, and WV—exhibit the highest MMR vaccine uptake and lowest incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases.

A recent analysis found that the average annual change in state vaccine exemption rates in recent school years has begun to level off nationally, whereas it had been increasing in earlier years [7]. In at least one-half of the 18 states allowing NMEs, the rates have begun to plateau over the last few years. However, it is important to note that NMEs continue to rise in at least one-third of the 18 states, with no signs of slowing in those rates. In addition, in those states with plateauing levels, the potential for outbreaks still exists. To better understand the problem of NMEs in the US, it is also helpful to examine the rates at the county level, given that NMEs are not distributed homogeneously within each state. Indeed, there are several counties representing hotspots of high NME rates, including some counties associated with large metropolitan areas where more than 400 kindergarten-aged children are not receiving their vaccines. For instance, TX has seen a particularly dramatic increase in NMEs of students in kindergarten through the 12th grade, multiplying nearly 20-fold since the policy’s inception in 2003 [6,8]. Our analysis identified the following hotspot metropolitan areas: Seattle, WA, Spokane, WA, and Portland, OR in the Northwest; Phoenix, AZ, Salt Lake City, UT, Provo, UT, Houston, TX, Fort Worth, TX, Plano, TX, and Austin, TX in the Southwest; Troy, MI, Warren, MI, Detroit, MI, and Kansas City, MO in the Midwest; and Pittsburgh, PA in the Northeast. It is important to note that our study is limited in its ability to correlate outbreaks with high NME communities, so the subsequent years will be critical in seeing how these potentials play out in a real-world setting. Strict policy changes have elicited significant decreases in NME rates, with philosophical-belief NME prohibitions serving as an effective policy intervention. Several states have also attempted to decrease the NME rate through less stringent means (S1 Table). One common option is requiring parents to view an educational module prior to obtaining an NME (OR in 2014, MI in 2015), yet the effect of curbing the NME rate may not persist beyond the short term. This assertion is supported by an initial drop in OR’s rate followed by a steady climb since 2014. Furthermore, AR—which mandated parental education and an annual application for an NME in 2003—has nonetheless seen a yearly increase in NMEs. In 2011, WA enacted a more rigorous requirement of a physician’s signature prior to obtaining an NME. Although the rate declined in the following school year, the outcome was short-lived, and the rate plateaued in subsequent years. Another potentially influential policy was in the form of a federal grant issued by ME’s state government in 2014 to train healthcare providers on effective communication surrounding vaccines. However, it is unclear whether this multiyear grant was primarily responsible for reversing the NME trend in a single year. In contrast to the states that sought to decrease NMEs, PA controversially began allowing the philosophical-beliefs exemption in 2014. The measles epidemic from 2014 to 2015 originating from the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, CA was a consequence of low MMR vaccination coverage of children (50%–86% vaccination rate among the exposed population) [9]. In direct response to the measles epidemic, the CA State Legislature passed Senate Bill 277 (SB 277) [10], which placed a statewide ban on NMEs starting January 1, 2016 to mirror previous actions in MI and WV [11]. The policy’s effect has been both immediate and significant. The number of kindergarteners with NMEs from 2016 to 2017 dropped to 3,133, the lowest that the state has seen in over a decade [11]. Each county reported significantly fewer children with NMEs. Accordingly, the new law also increased the state’s kindergarten vaccination rates, which reached a record high during 2016 to 2017: 95.6% of kindergarteners received all required vaccines compared to 92.8% in 2015 to 2016 [11]. Given the effectiveness of closing the exemption policy, evidence suggests that other states should consider discontinuing the NME option and protect schoolchildren from vaccine-preventable diseases. Stricter legislative action to close NMEs should become a higher priority because of the positive correlation between leniency of state vaccination policies and exemption rates. On average, states with policies that permit both types of NMEs have 2.5 times higher exemption rates [12]. Although many states demonstrate rising exemption totals irrespective of the exemption policy, states that make it harder to obtain exemptions have demonstrated slower-growing opt-out rates over time. Therefore, it is critical to identify states at highest risk for an outbreak due to a rise in NMEs. As has been demonstrated by past policy changes, uptake in vaccination rates by communities requires multiple measures (S1 Table). It has been pointed out that a vertical policy change, such as the one highlighted above, should be accompanied by expanded horizontal efforts to increase access to vaccines and booster shots, educational programs, and awareness campaigns [12–14]. For instance, healthcare providers might play a greater role in promoting vaccination. The presumptive strategy of health communication, which promotes the safety and routineness of vaccination, between provider and parent has been shown to discourage parents from seeking to obtain NMEs [13]. Furthermore, greater community involvement through churches, neighborhood clinics, and provaccination celebrity allies would help to reach both undervaccinated communities—who are affected by vaccine access-related issues—and unvaccinated groups. Recently, Opel and colleagues identified key policies in the areas of enforcement and reimbursement for pediatricians or other providers who advise vaccine-hesitant parents [14]. As indicated by the increase in NME rates despite ND’s policy passage to increase vaccine supply without physician education (S1 Table), it is critical to achieve community buy-in through targeted education campaigns. A multifaceted approach with a central emphasis on discontinuing NMEs will work to increase vaccination rates across a wider scope of the American population and reduce the risk of otherwise preventable and costly disease outbreaks. The results reported here for the US have potential relevance internationally. While NMEs continue to rise in most of the 18 US states that allow them, several European countries, including France and Italy, as well as Australia, have taken measures to either make vaccines compulsory or even fine parents who refuse to vaccinate their children [15–17]. Romania has experienced serious and large measles outbreaks and may also tighten vaccine legislation [18]. Our concern is that the rising NMEs linked to the antivaccine movement in the US will stimulate other countries to follow a similar path. It would be especially worrisome if the very large low- and middle-income countries—such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China (the BRIC nations), or Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan—reduce their vaccine coverage. In such a case, we could experience massive epidemics of childhood infections that may threaten achievement of United Nations global goals [19].\n\nAcknowledgments We would like to acknowledge the following state health departments that provided us with data wherever possible: AR Department of Health, ID Department of Health and Welfare, LA Department of Health, MI Department of Health and Human Services, MO Department of Health and Senior Services, ND Department of Health, OR Health Authority, TX Department of State Health Services, UT Department of Health, and WI Department of Health Services.",

        "text": "States Move To Restrict Parents' Refusal To Vaccinate Their Kids\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtney Perry/The Washington Post/Getty Images Courtney Perry/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nAll U.S. states require most parents to vaccinate their children against some preventable diseases, including measles, mumps, rubella and whooping cough, to be able to attend school. Such laws often apply to children in private schools and day care facilities as well as public schools.\n\nAt the same time, beyond medical exemptions, most states also allow parents to opt out of this vaccination requirement for religious reasons. And 17 states permit other exemptions — allowing families to opt out of school vaccination requirements for personal or philosophical reasons.\n\nMichelle Mello, a professor of law and health research and policy at Stanford University, says the bar for claiming an exemption from vaccine requirements has been very low in many states. \"You can believe that vaccines don't work or that they are unsafe or they simply fly in the face of your parenting philosophy,\" she says.\n\nBut this winter's outbreaks of measles across the nation are resulting in challenges to many exemptions: At least eight states, including some that have experienced measles outbreaks this year, want to remove personal exemptions for the measles vaccine. And some states would remove the exemption for all vaccines.\n\nMost of this year's measles cases have been among children who were not vaccinated against the virus.\n\nOnce considered eradicated in the U.S., measles has sickened at least 159 people since the start of 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in outbreaks ranging from Washington and Oregon to Texas and New York. Last year, there were 372 reported cases of measles nationwide.\n\nThe move among state legislatures to tighten vaccine requirements is good news to Diane Peterson, the associate director for immunization projects with the pro-vaccine advocacy group Immunization Action Coalition.\n\n\"Measles is not like a common cold,\" Peterson says. \"Children get very, very sick and can be hospitalized,\" she says, adding that measles can even lead to death.\n\nThe virus is highly contagious, airborne and easily spreads. It can survive in the air for a couple of hours.\n\n\"A patient with measles can go to the doctor, cough in the exam room and two hours later another patient coming into the same exam room can be infected,\" Peterson says.\n\nThe virus is spreading fast this winter, she says, because of the \"pockets of children who have not been vaccinated, mostly due to parents who have decided not to vaccinate them.\"\n\nThis leaves not only those unvaccinated school children vulnerable to the virus but also many adults who have suppressed immune systems and infants who are not old enough to be vaccinated.\n\nAccording to the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, bills to restrict exemptions are now pending in a growing number of states.\n\nNone of this sits well with activists who want their states to maintain personal and philosophical exemptions.\n\n\"Nobody should sit in judgment of another person's religious and spiritual beliefs,\" says Barbara Loe Fisher, a spokesperson for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that lobbies against mandatory vaccination and thinks parents should have a choice. \"No person should be allowed to force someone to violate their conscience when they're making a decision about the use of a pharmacological product that carries a risk of harm.\"\n\nThe scientific consensus about any risk from vaccines is that serious side effects are extremely rare. A suggestion that immunization might be tied to severe consequences like autism was debunked years ago, after findings supporting that link were proved fraudulent.\n\nMello, the Stanford law professor who has been following the exemption debate, notes that the courts have repeatedly held that when a public health intervention is necessary to safeguard the public, individuals generally can be required to give up some personal liberty, particularly if that liberty is tied to a government benefit like school.\n\nSo far, only three states — Mississippi, West Virginia and California — prohibit nearly all vaccine exemptions, including the one exempting families who say their religious belief conflicts with vaccination. (All states allow medical exemptions when, for example, a child has a compromised immune system.)\n\nThe California state Legislature made that decision in 2015, less than a year after the state experienced a significant measles outbreak that got its first foothold among unvaccinated children visiting Disneyland.",

Sussman called Day's action \"arbitrary and capricious.\"The county attorney argued it was necessary to stop the contagious virus.The judge granted a temporary injunction, which for the time being, will end the state of emergency. This means unvaccinated children will once again be allowed to go to school and out in public.The judge said such emergency orders cannot exceed five days. He also noted that 166 measles cases in a population of 330,000 people over six months doesn't constitute an \"epidemic\" meriting an emergency declaration.Day released the following statement after the ruling:(The Associated Press contributed to this report.)----------",

        "text": "Defeating measles has long been a cherished dream in global health. Just in 2016, according to the World Health Organization, the disease infected more than 20 million people and killed almost 90,000 children. But no one is even sure when such a campaign might begin. Opposing camps within public health argue either that the time is now, to piggyback on top of current campaigns, or after polio is gone, because we can only fund and focus on one global disease at a time. In other words: Is the best way to end measles in the future by not ending measles now? Could the failures—and near-successes—of other eradication campaigns ultimately teach us how to conquer measles?\n\nSome of those diseases—like polio, Guinea worm, and river blindness—currently cause only a handful of cases. That public health workers have been chasing them for decades, spending billions of dollars in the process, elevates the effort to quixotic. But there’s a hidden motivation to their work. Every year they work to vanquish these infections, they’re training for a much bigger campaign to come: wiping out measles, one of the most infectious viruses on the planet.\n\nDuring 2017, hundreds of thousands of people spent their working hours, and weeks and months of volunteer time, on an elusive goal: trying to snuff a handful of stubborn diseases out of existence.\n\nAfter the thrill of eradicating smallpox, declared gone from the world in 1980 after a 14-year effort, global health planners dreamed big dreams about the other diseases they would vanquish. But in the years since, eradication efforts stalled. The campaign against Guinea worm has been going since 1980; polio, since 1988; river blindness, in the Americas, since 1992.\n\nSmallpox had been chosen not just because it was a killer, but because it possessed qualities that made eradication plausible. It affected only humans and couldn’t hide in animals or the environment. It produced visible signs of illness, quickly—epidemiologists could easily trace who had infected whom—and its symptoms were unique. And it could be prevented with just one dose of a vaccine.\n\nAs it happens, measles fits those conditions too—more so than the other diseases that have been in public health’s sights since. It has no nonhuman host. It can be detected with a reliable diagnostic test. And it can be prevented with a single vaccine dose (though kids in the United States get two childhood doses, just to be sure).\n\nBut the smallpox vaccine was delivered in a uniquely low-tech way, jabbed into the skin with a forked needle that held a drop of vaccine between its tines. The measles vaccine uses a syringe, which requires trained healthcare personnel and safe sharps disposal. And measles in the 1980s (and even now) was everywhere, a routine disease in most of the world.\n\nSo, instead, global planners chose polio, which then caused about 350,000 cases of paralysis per year. It could be prevented by a simple oral vaccine, and polio had already been eliminated from North and South America, which made global success seem plausible.\n\nBut polio was more complicated than anyone knew. Faults in vaccine transportation, and sometimes quirks in the biology of the gut, where the virus replicates, meant that it could take many more doses than anticipated to create immunity. Then researchers discovered the vaccine’s weakened virus could mutate to regain its strength, causing outbreaks identical to the wild virus.\n\nThe campaign’s 2000 deadline came and went. Other hopeful end dates did too. By last year, there were only 21 cases of wild polio in the world—but there also were 86 cases of vaccine-derived polio.\n\nThe cases caused by wild virus are in Afghanistan and Pakistan, places that everyone always understood would be difficult. But the cases caused by the vaccine move around the map, made possible by wars and unrest that prevent vaccinators getting to children. In 2017, those were Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in 2016, the parts of the Lake Chad basin overlapping northern Nigeria that are controlled by the terrorist group Boko Haram.\n\nAs with smallpox and polio, the Guinea worm campaign presumed the disease it targeted had no nonhuman host. Instead, the infection has found a new niche to hide in.\n\nA dark gift of eradication campaigns is that their intense focus on a disease reveals things that research had never recognized before. It wasn’t until the polio campaign began that vaccine-derived polio was even discovered. Years down the line, scientists have realized the mutated virus can be a long-lasting risk. It can reproduce for years in the guts of people with certain immune system disorders, making them permanent emitters of infectious virus that passes into sewage. That’s driven development of new antiviral drugs to give to those long-term excreters, to prevent them from being the disease’s last refuge.\n\n“It is always the last mile that is so difficult,” says Mark McKinley, who leads a project at the Atlanta-based Task Force for Global Health to develop two polio antivirals. “You learn things you didn’t know and uncover aspects of the problem you didn’t appreciate.”\n\nThat turned out to be true for Guinea worm as well, a parasitic disease that occurs when people unknowingly drink larvae floating in stagnant water. After a year of incubation, the larvae form a yard-long worm and break through the skin. There is no vaccine to prevent it and no drug that kills the larvae; the only treatment is to slowly pull the worm out, which can take months.\n\nThe essence of the campaign against it, which was created by the Carter Center in Atlanta and is now led by Donald Hopkins, a physician and epidemiologist who was in the thick of the smallpox campaign, is to keep infected people from accidentally fouling water sources, and to persuade villages at risk to filter their drinking water. And it has worked. In 2017, there were just 30 cases, down from 3 million in 1980.\n\nBut as with polio, Guinea worm had a surprise in store. As Hopkins told me, the parasite has found a new home in stray dogs, which may have picked it up from eating fish guts dumped by villagers. Infected dogs, wading in for a drink, recontaminate ponds and streams. As with smallpox and polio, the Guinea worm campaign presumed the disease it targeted had no nonhuman host. Instead, the infection has found a new niche to hide in.\n\nThe challenges don’t stop with the diseases’ biological ingenuity. River blindness, a parasitic disease transmitted by flies, has been eliminated in most of the Americas thanks to a donated drug. But it hangs on stubbornly in a pocket on the Brazil-Venezuela border, where illegal mining operations make it impossible to get treatment to the Yanomami tribe. “The challenges are transport, the cost of operating in these remote areas, and frankly political will,” says Frank Richards, a tropical-disease physician who leads the program on river blindness at the Carter Center. “Brazil and Venezuela both have problems that seem a lot bigger to them than river blindness.” In river blindness, in other words, there’s a government failure, and also a civic one.\n\nThough the United States and Western Europe aren’t the Amazonian jungle, those same challenges lie in wait for any measles campaign to come. Even in areas where that disease has been fought to a standstill—endemic cases in the US were eliminated in 2016—it has recurred because the virus can find a foothold in vulnerable populations. In the US, where measles vaccination is mandatory for children, most of that vulnerability has been created by parents refusing the vaccine for their kids.\n\nThat was the main driver in 2014 of 383 measles cases in Amish communities in Ohio, and in 2015 of 147 cases in a multistate outbreak that began at Disneyland. However: Along with unvaccinated children, the Disneyland outbreak included six children who got the measles vaccine, but didn’t develop immunity. That suggests that any future measles campaign will face unpredicted surprises, just as the polio and Guinea worm campaigns did.\n\nThe cost of eradicating measles has been predicted to be $7 billion to $14 billion; the benefits are only realized later. Though they are huge: A study earlier this month by researchers from Harvard, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and elsewhere predicted that fully vaccinating against measles would save more than 22 million lives by 2030, and keep almost 5 million people from falling into poverty.\n\nLong-time campaigners are counting on a measles campaign to ignite a new fervor for public health work. Richards, who was in medical school during the smallpox campaign, remembers being inspired by stories of what it took to eradicate history’s worst killer. “Here we are at 99.99 percent,” he says. “In any other public health program, you would be getting high fives and raises and be on to the next thing.” Instead, they’re continuing on—to ensure the next campaign’s success.\n\nStamping Out Disease\n\nPersonalized medicine promised a cure for rare genetic disorders—and now, patients and families themselves are trying to make up for its failures.\n\nAdvances in AI could let your Apple Watch flag signs of diabetes.\n\nWe're on the verge of a terrifying new era of antibiotic resistance. One scientist is trying to ward off an apocalypse...with dirt.\n\nPhotograph by WIRED/Getty Images",

        "text": "In early 2015, Sen. Ervin Yen, an anaesthesiologist who became Oklahoma’s first Asian American state legislator, introduced a bill to require all schoolchildren to be vaccinated, unless they had a medical reason not to. California had recently debuted similar legislation after an outbreak of measles in Disneyland sickened 147 people and led to the quarantine of more than 500 others. At the time, California’s vaccination rates were below the 94 percent threshold needed to establish community immunity for measles. Oklahoma’s vaccination rates were even lower than California’s. Yen, a moderate Republican, felt like he had to do something.\n\nBut his bill never made it out of committee. The next year, he tried again, modifying the language to allow for religious objections. It failed too. So did the one Yen introduced in 2017. In 2018 he tried yet again, along with a resolution that would have placed the elimination of all non-medical vaccine exemptions on the general election ballot in November.\n\nThose too, were defeated. On Tuesday, Oklahoma voters won’t have the option of checking that particular box. They also won’t have the option of re-electing Yen. In June, the incumbent Senator lost a shocker of a primary to an outsider Republican candidate, Joe Howell.\n\nIf you ask Yen why he lost, he’ll offer a variety of reasons in his soft, Oklahoma City twang. But he suspects the biggest factor was the influence of local anti-vaccination activists. According to campaign finance filings, Oklahomans for Vaccine and Health Choice were the second biggest donor to Howell’s campaign, after only Howell himself. “They weren’t the only reason I lost, but there’s no question the anti-vaxxers were important in my defeat,” says Yen.\n\nIn other hotbeds of anti-vaccine sentiment, centrist conservatives who’ve championed similar bills have also been conspicuously missing from this year’s midterm ballots. Replacing them are candidates backed by well-financed organizations made up of members who either entertain the fraudulent science linking vaccines to autism, who believe their kids have had adverse vaccine reactions, or think the government shouldn’t dictate what goes in their children’s bodies.\n\nParents who have questioned the wisdom of immunizations are not a new phenomenon. In the 1960s and 70s, Christian scientists proved effective lobbyists for exemption clauses in vaccine laws. From the 80s through the early 2000s, that mantle was taken up by a handful of short-lived grassroots groups organizing at the state level. But in the last few years, the modern anti-vaccination movement has evolved into a new chapter: the political action committee. In the 18 states that currently permit parents to send their unvaccinated children to public schools on the grounds of philosophical objections, “Vaccine Freedom” PACs are increasingly flexing political muscle to keep it that way. By making a broader appeal to parental rights, some groups are now pushing agendas that would eliminate vaccine mandates of any kind. And as they shape this year’s election ballots to be more favorable to their cause, the nation creeps ever closer to an infectious disease outbreak as inevitable as it will be tragic.\n\n“I hold my breath every March,” says Peter Hotez, a pediatrician-scientist and Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, who has predicted that a measles epidemic will soon explode in his home state of Texas. (In the pre-vaccine era these outbreaks usually occurred in the late winter or early spring.) He recently published an analysis of US cities with the highest rates of non-medical vaccine exemptions. Four of these urban outbreak hotspots occurred in Texas. “I’m even more worried now because the numbers keep trending the wrong way,” he says.\n\nEarlier this summer, the Texas state health department released data showing that 57,000 kindergarten through 12th grade students during the 2017-18 school year had at least one non-medical exemption on file, up from 53,000 the year before. As the Houston Chronicle reported, it was the first time that number reached more than one percent of all Texas schoolchildren. In three counties, non-medical exemption rates reach as high as nine percent.\n\n“We’ve got kids dying of the flu, an enormous risk of a measles outbreak, over what?” says Hotez, who has been one of the loudest voices to condemn the modern anti-vaccine movement. “Over crap. Over nothing. These phony terms that anti-vaccine groups have claimed like ‘medical freedom’ or ‘parental choice’ ignores the fact that children have a fundamental human right to be protected against deadly diseases.”\n\nHotez, who has an adult daughter who was diagnosed with autism at 19 months, recently wrote a book titled Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism, that he hopes will help reverse some of the trends he finds worrying. And he’s quick to suggest that scientists like himself for too long stood silent on the sidelines of public debate and should shoulder some of the blame for the current situation. But speaking out has come with its own price. Hotez says he now routinely gets harassing emails and messages trying to discredit him on social media, as well as demonstrators who show up at his lectures.\n\nYen says he endured a similar smear campaign; his church parking lot was papered with flyers comparing him to Hitler and Mussolini, and racist mailers portrayed him as a syringe-wielding authoritarian in front of the Imperial Japan rising sun flag (Yen was born in Taiwan). “They’ve been slamming me for four years with this stuff, he says.” Oklahomans for Vaccine and Health Choice did not respond to WIRED’s request for an interview.\n\nRep. Jason Villalba, a three-term Republican state legislator from Dallas, has also experienced some of these intimidation tactics first-hand. In 2015, Villalba filed legislation to end religious and philosophical vaccine exemptions, a loophole in state law dating back to 2007. Like Yen, he was concerned about a potential measles outbreak, especially with a two-month-old son at home.\n\nIn response, a mother named Jackie Schlegel, who says that one of her kids was injured by vaccines, formed a Facebook group of “mad moms in minivans” to kill the bill. The group quickly grew into a political action committee called Texans for Vaccine Choice determined to protect their right to medical freedom.\n\nAfter the bill’s defeat, the group turned its efforts to unseating Villalba, backing primary challengers to his re-election campaign in 2016 that ran largely on the vaccine exemption issue. According to Villalba, every time he’d show up at the polls to greet people, two or three people from TFVC would be there to confront him and yell insults. “They just wanted to ridicule me and make me look foolish,” says Villalba. “I didn’t think that was an effective way to win hearts and minds.”\n\nSchlegel denies having knowledge of any such encounters, saying only that TFVC’s tactics are to protect and advance informed medical consent. “We are the friendly face of vaccine choice and that is what we do,” she says.\n\nDespite their efforts, Villalba won the primaries with 55 percent of the vote. But he’d been rattled. In the House’s last session he told Schlegel he wouldn’t file another vaccine bill unless there was an outbreak in Texas. “I said, ‘if you stand down, I’ll stand down,” says Villalba, recalling the encounter. “I thought we had a truce.” But when he came up for re-election again two years later, Texans for Vaccine Choice found a new candidate to run against him—a far-right challenger named Lisa Luby Ryan. And again they block-walked, poll-watched, and raised money. According to state ethics commission filings, the group has so far spent slightly more than $215,000 on campaign expenditures in 2018, more than five times what it spent in either of the previous two years. Schlegel says TFVC supported candidates friendly to the group’s mission all across the state, not just in Villalba’s district. “It wasn’t personal with him,” she says. “While he didn’t refile the vaccine mandate bill he certainly didn’t stand for informed consent and medical privacy and vaccine choice.”\n\nAt around midnight on March 6th, primary night in Dallas, Ryan sat grinning between Schlegel and Rebecca Hardy, the group’s state policy director. “We just got a call from Representative Villalba, who conceded to us and wished us well,” said Ryan in a Facebook video. “Victory!” shouted Schlegel and Hardy, arms raised high. Three weeks later, a fracking billionaire named Farris Wilks, one of the state’s biggest political donors, cut a check to Texans for Vaccine Choice for $90,000.\n\nAlthough the group was swift to take credit for his loss, Villalba thinks that storyline is a bit oversold. More important to his defeat, he believes, was a different kind of outbreak in Texas: Beto Fever. In his wealthy, educated district, which Clinton won by 14 points in 2016, about a fifth of the district’s Republicans switched over to vote Democratic in this year’s primaries. “That left all the residual voters who hail from the farthest of the far right fringes,” he says.\n\nBut the two phenomena are far from unrelated. They’re both a consequence of Trump’s tumultuous, anti-establishment presidency that from its earliest days welcomed the antivax perspective into its fold. Candidates with previously untenable politics are now finding a place for themselves on major party tickets. Democratic candidates are hoping to use that to their advantage, to flip seats wherever moderate Republican voters are looking to course-correct GOP primary voters who swung too far to the right.\n\nOn Tuesday, Americans will head to the polls to cast their votes in what may be the most consequential midterm elections in modern US history. While all eyes will be on the national races that could shift power in Washington, just as crucial are the state legislative elections taking place further down the ballot. States are the battlefields where the Trump administration’s war on science, regulations, the environment, and the rights of minorities are increasingly being fought. They are where decisions about vaccines as a cornerstone of 21st-century public health policy get made.\n\nThe good news is that laws work. When California got rid of personal belief exemptions in 2015, only 90.4 percent of kindergartners in public schools were fully immunized. In the 2017-18 school year, 95.1 percent of kindergartners had all their immunizations, according to the California Department of Health. The bad news is, California is one of only three states to have such strict requirements.\n\nAs vaccine freedom PACs move from the margins to mainstream, more and more kids are going to school unvaccinated. Data released in October from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that while national exemption rates remain low at 2.2 percent, this is the third year that exemptions have increased. At least where vaccinations are concerned, where California goes, the nation does not seem to be following.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories",

        "text": "In recent years, the United States has been confronting a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases—most notably, a measles outbreak that began in California's Disneyland in December, spurred on by the state's low vaccination rates. Fed up with the altogether avoidable outbreaks, several states have introduced legislation to eliminate the philosophical opt-out, a way for parents to get around public schools' vaccine requirements for their kids. As early as Tuesday, the California State Assembly will vote on SB-277, a law that would ban the so-called personal belief exemption. School boards, medical associations, and community leaders support the law.\n\nBut a small group of vocal anti-vaxxers is fighting hard to keep it from passing. This group, which leverages the power of social media, has launched a full-scale attack on the bill as it travels through the legislature. Each day, leaders craft tweets and instruct followers to disseminate them. Several senators who voted in favor of the California legislation have found themselves receiving extensive attention from the group—one, Senator Hannah Beth Jackson, has been @-mentioned (often unfavorably) in a particular Twitter hashtag more than 2,000 times since casting her vote in favor of the legislation.\n\nOne small, vocal group can have a disproportionate impact on public sentiment and legislation. Welcome to Anti-Vax Twitter.\n\nThis anti-vax activity might seem like low-stakes, juvenile propaganda. But social networking has the potential to significantly impact public perception of events—and the power to influence opinions increasingly lies with those who can most widely and effectively disseminate a message. One small, vocal group can have a disproportionate impact on public sentiment and legislation. Welcome to \"Anti-Vax Twitter.\"\n\nSince anti-vax activists lose on the science and are small in number, they have increasingly begun to rely on social media to inflate their presence. Twitter hashtags are particularly powerful because they transcend organized groups and the standard friend or follower relationships. More than any other social network, Twitter helps citizens to connect and organize in the real world even if they aren’t part of the same physical communities—anyone can participate in a conversation simply by following and using a hashtag.\n\nA network graph showing the relationship between anti-vax, conservative, and autism clusters on Twitter. Scale Model\n\nTo take a closer look at how anti-vax Twitter organizes its attacks, specifically against the California legislation, we analyzed the hashtags used by people in the network. In network graphs like the one above, circular nodes are Twitter handles; larger nodes indicate accounts with more followers within the network, making their tweets more likely to be seen and acted upon. That's called \"high centrality.\" The lines between the nodes represent follower relationships. Different colors represent communities of people who are sharing a similar message, and the distance between regions is based on common ties—the closer a colored group is to another, the more shared connections its members have, and the more likely information is to spread amongst the groups.\n\nMuch like any other group with a message, anti-vaxxers have leveraged Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for quite some time. In the early days, the majority of their activism focused on propagating the myth of the autism-vaccination connection. In August of 2014, anti-vax activity began to coalesce into one primary hashtag: #cdcwhistleblower, a reference to an anti-vaxxer conspiracy theory that claims the CDC is concealing information that proves a link between the MMR vaccine and autism in African American children.\n\nWithin two days, autism-vaccine proponents had looped in celebrity sympathizers such as Donald Trump and Rob Schneider to amplify their message. Andrew Wakefield, author of the original fraudulent study linking MMR and autism, got involved. CDC scientists responded, but the idea of the conspiracy—and the hashtag—continued to grow in popularity. There were 250,000 #cdcwhistleblower tweets between August 18 and December 1 of 2014. A whopping 63,555 of these came from 10 prominent anti-vax accounts.\n\nLike any good brand, that messaging has evolved to tie to current events, including legislation to increase vaccination rates.\n\nIn terms of massive events and national conversations, 250,000 tweets is rather small (there were 19.1 million tweets sent in a 12 hour period about the Oscars). But it became apparent to anti-vax leaders that this Twitter hashtag had attracted a loyal following among true believers. And so, in December 2014, “hashtag organizers” began to publish nightly “Trends and Tips” (TaTips) instruction videos on YouTube, containing instructions on what to tweet to advance the cause, and to improve the SEO of “vaccine questioning” websites. There are over 150 of these videos now—a testament to how much the anti-vax movement prioritizes Twitter.\n\nLike any good brand, that messaging has evolved to tie to current events—including legislation to increase vaccination rates. As the California personal exemption bill progressed, tweets with the #cdcwhistleblower hashtag started to shift to include #sb277, the number of the bill.\n\nWhen we dig into the activity in the #sb277 hashtag over time, trends and ties emerge. If you look at the first network graph, several distinct clusters emerge based on the hashtags and topics tweeted by each account. In other words, we didn't search for the group labels deliberately; they revealed themselves. Pink is tweeters focused on anti-vax content; orange is the autism community. These groups tweet about many of the same topics, but don't share the exact same material or use the same hashtags. Blue are social conservatives, many of whom use popular Tea Party hashtags. The long strands between the blue groups and the anti-vaxxer group indicates minimal overlap among accounts following each other; the networks are not tightly connected.\n\nA network graph showing the emergence of the “parental choice,” or “vaccine choice” subset from within the anti-vax cluster. This messaging appeared after anti-vaxxers lost a legislative committee vote. Scale Model\n\nBut as you look at this second network graph, you can see how antivax political strategy has shifted. A new group emerges in the space between “Antivax Twitter” and “Conservative Twitter”—we call it “vaccine choice” Twitter. The tweeters are the same individuals who have long been active in the autism-vaccine #cdcwhistleblower network. And originally, much of the content shared in #sb277 focused on the same anti-vax pseudoscience underlying #cdcwhistleblower. However, as bad science and conspiracies repeatedly lost in legislative votes, anti-vaxxers updated their marketing: They are now “pro-SAFE vaccine” parental rights advocates. Instructions to the group now focus on hammering home traditionally conservative “parental choice” and “health freedom” messaging rather than tweeting about autism and toxins.\n\nTwitter activity around #sb277 is part of a multipronged strategy that takes place alongside phone, email, and fax campaigns, coordinated by well-funded groups including the Canary Party and the NVIC. The net effect is that legislators and staffers feel besieged on all fronts. In one unfortunate video, a movement leader encouraged supporters to use Twitter to harass and stalk a lobbyist, who has since filed police reports. In a very recent creation, that same leader excoriates her “Twitter army” for diluting the power of the #cdcwhistleblower movement by creating their own hashtags rather than using the ones they’ve been assigned. She also requests that the entire network tweet at Assembly representatives to inform them that their political careers will be over if they vote in favor of SB277. Much like Food Babe leverages her #foodbabearmy to flood corporations with demands for change, the goal of anti-vax twitter is to dominate the conversation and make it look as if all parents are vehemently opposed to the legislation.\n\nA zoomed-in view of the online antivax community, which includes @DrWakefield, author of the original fraudulent study linking MMR and autism. Scale Model\n\nThe other finding from observing anti-vax network graphs is that despite the vast majority vaccinating—national vaccination rates remain above 90 percent—there is no offsetting pro-vaccine Twitter machine; most parents simply vaccinate and move on with their lives. People don't organize in groups around everyday life-saving measures; there is no pro-seatbelt activist community on Twitter. The recent emergence, lack of central coordination, and weak connections seen among pro-vaccine Twitter users, who often use the hashtag #vaccineswork, means that the pro-vax message (in green) is not amplified to the same degree.\n\n“Tweetiatrician” doctors, lawyers, and pro-vaccine parents often do attempt to join the conversation around the antivax hashtags. Unfortunately, many of the most active accounts experience the same attention received by the legislators: They become the target of harassment that includes phone calls to their places of employment, tweets posting identifying information or photos of their children, or warnings that they are being watched. Pro-vaccine activists and legislators alike often encounter paranoia when they attempt to engage the anti-vax community. They face accusations of being shills paid by Big Pharma to sway the narrative and keep “vaccine choice” activists from spreading The Truth.\n\nThe broader public health implications of propagating these memes and articles make anti-vax activities more than a bizarre online curiosity.\n\nLike many fringe communities, while the group is extremely well-organized and passionate they are largely tweeting into an echo chamber. Twitter users who don’t look for these hashtags would likely not know that they exist. Besides occasional celebrity amplification, very little percolates out to a mainstream audience or trends at a meaningful level. And even theoretically-sympathetic affinity groups that they occasionally reach out to, such as anti-GMO, conservative, and autism groups, are not amplifying their hashtags.\n\nHowever, the broader public health implications of propagating these memes and articles make anti-vax activities more than a bizarre online curiosity. Most of the material that the #cdcwhistleblower accounts tweet are designed to erode confidence in vaccination. The goal is to make new parents question everything, says anti-vax leader Dana Gorman in one of her instructional videos. Public health officials are concerned. \"It is important to remember that today, the vast majority of people follow the recommended vaccine schedule—they take the advice of their doctors, supported by professional medical bodies and the WHO,\" says Gary Finnegan, editor of Vaccines Today. \"However, it is essential that when people go online for information they are left with the clear impression that vaccines are safe and effective.\" If that's going to change, the people fighting misinformation need to understand how it gets spread in the first place.\n\nRenee DiResta works in technology in San Francisco and invests in startups.

        "text": "MINNEAPOLIS — On the first Saturday this May, residents of the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood socialized in the shadows of their towering public housing complexes. Chattering men sat for haircuts while head-scarved women shopped the stalls lining the blue-bricked Riverside Mall. At nearby Currie Park, training-wheeled biker boys chased each other, circling a drained wading pool where girls played a game of tag. Their relatives picnicked in the shade.\n\nNot so visible was the fact that this Somali-American community—Minnesota's largest—is currently experiencing the state's worst measles outbreak in nearly three decades. On Thursday, the count rose to 44 confirmed cases across three counties. Public health officials are now scrambling to keep the disease from reaching pockets of unvaccinated kids in other parts of the state. This means advising accelerated shot schedules to doctors and parents, and considering quarantine orders for anyone who has been exposed. The health officials know that once a measles outbreak gets going, it can be very difficult to contain, even if they expected it.\n\nAnd they totally expected it. Over the last decade, anti-vaxxers have fortified this corner of Minneapolis into a bastion for pseudo-science. It all began with higher-than-normal rates of severe autism in the Somali community. And when state and university researchers failed to understand why the disorder hit so hard here, families went looking for answers elsewhere: friends, and the all-knowing internet. In came the anti-vax partisans, whose success with these frightened parents has turned the neighborhood into a beachhead for what should be a preventable disease.\n\nMeasles kills about 10,000 children a year in Somalia. So when the first wave of refugees from that country's civil war brought their kids to Minneapolis in the 1990s, vaccination rates were high—around 90 percent by 2004. Four years later, Somali parents began noticing a rising number of autistic children in their community. They cried out to city officials, who enlisted researchers from the University of Minnesota, CDC, and NIH to launch an investigation. Those epidemiologists found that autism rates in Minneapolis’s Somali community were higher than the national average. But the rate was identical to autism in Minneapolis's white population.\n\nWhat was different was that Somali children didn't just get autism, they consistently got the most extreme version of it. By comparison, only about a third of non-Somali kids with autism were also diagnosed with intellectual disabilities—such as delayed speech or difficulty understanding abstract concepts and social rules. For Somali autistics, it was 100 percent.\n\n“In some ways that finding was very consistent with what we were hearing from the community—that autism hits Somali kids much harder,” says the study’s lead author, Amy Hewitt. But her results only told people what they already suspected, not what they were looking for: What was causing the autism.\n\nNot that it would have mattered much if she had. By the time Hewitt’s study was published in 2013, anti-vaccination activists had already claimed Cedar-Riverside. Andrew Wakefield—the study-falsifying founder of the modern anti-vaxx movement—met with upset Somali families three times between 2010 and 2011. And Minneapolis health officials say it’s not hard to draw a line between this targeted misinformation campaign and the current measles outbreak. Kris Ehresmann, director of the health department's Infectious Disease Division, points to the precipitous drop in vaccination rates in recent years: Today, only four out of every 10 Somali kids in the city are protected against the disease. Even as recently as last Sunday, groups like the Vaccine Safety Council for Minnesota organized a public meeting to help Somali families understand their legal rights to refuse the same vaccinations public health officials are anxiously urging them to get.\n\n“The answer used to be education—the more educated you were on the issue the more likely you were to get vaccinated,” says Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research. Those days are over, he says. In no small part thanks to the proliferation of misleading information on the web. “The challenge is for scientists to be humble and acknowledge that in this day and age facts will not win the day,” he says.\n\nMinnesota’s Health Department has been trying to take a page from that playbook. It has changed up its tactics in the past few years—hiring Somali nurses and outreach workers to pave inroads into the community, and working with imams and other leaders to create a network of trusted individuals who can combat internet-fueled fears. And they’ve begun taking up alternative communication strategies. Rather than use bullet-pointed barrages of facts, they illustrate their points with stories about, say, someone whose child came down with measles.\n\nCatherine Mary Healy, the director of the Center for Vaccine Awareness and Research at Texas Children's Hospital, says this is a better strategy for communities that haven’t been exposed to an outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases. “When they come across misinformation, they interpret it in a different way than you or I might because they’re unable to weight the risk/benefit ratio appropriately,” she says. Healy works with many Latino immigrant groups in Texas, where she says vaccination efforts are highly successful because so many of them have experienced measles firsthand.\n\nThis echoes what officials around Minnesota have been clear about from the beginning of the outbreak: This isn’t an immigrant problem or a Somali problem, it’s an unvaccinated problem. But there is reason to be hopeful that evidence-based information can still win the day. Research shows that the most important factor for parents making the decision whether or not to immunize comes down to their doctors' opinion. And the investments Minnesota has made in providing tailored health care services to Somali families, especially those with autistic children, may be beginning to pay off.\n\nThe Brian Coyle Community Center, which bustles with basketball-crazed kids, is in the middle of the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood—the outbreak's epicenter. And just a few days ago, the community center's walls had been pasted with flyers promoting the connection between the vaccine and autism. But the Somali staff decided to take them down. On request, the man working the front desk Saturday afternoon (who didn't want to share his name) produces a crumpled advertisement for last weekend's anti-vaxx public meeting. \"I don't understand these people,\" he says, shaking his head. \"With my children, if the doctor says to do something, we do it. They know best.\"",

        "text": "Two years ago, a 6-year-old boy playing on his family’s farm in Oregon cut himself. His parents cleaned the wound and stitched it, and everything seemed fine—until, six days later, he began having muscle spasms, arching his back, and clenching his jaw. The boy had tetanus, the first case in a child to occur in Oregon in more than 30 years.\n\nTetanus is rare because a routine childhood vaccine prevents it. The boy’s parents had elected not to vaccinate him. A case report written by a physician who treated him along with staff members at the state health department and published this month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relates what happened next.\n\nMaryn McKenna (@marynmck) is an Ideas contributor for WIRED, a senior fellow at the Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism at Brandeis University, and the author of Big Chicken.\n\nThe boy was airlifted to a university medical center and given immunotherapy and the first dose of the vaccine regimen he had missed. His spasms were so severe he could not open his mouth or breathe, so he was admitted to an intensive care unit, placed in a medical coma, and put on a ventilator. His body couldn’t regulate itself; his heart rate sped up and his temperature soared and dipped, so he had to be pumped full of IV drugs to keep his vital signs under control.\n\nEventually he recovered, but only after 57 days in the hospital and 17 days in a rehab center learning to speak again once his tracheostomy healed and relearning to walk when his muscle tone came back. His parents took him back to the family farm. Before they left, they refused to allow him to receive any other vaccinations, including the second dose of vaccine that would have cemented his immunity to the infection that almost killed him.\n\nThere’s a coda to the story of the boy’s unnecessary endangerment and unlikely survival. The CDC reports that his care, just in the hospital—exclusive of the air ambulance or the more than two weeks in rehab—cost more than $800,000.\n\nWhen we talk about vaccines, we tend to talk about the clinical impact of refusing them, the potentially deadly danger that vaccine-preventable diseases pose to the unvaccinated or the immunocompromised when herd immunity breaks down. Every grave illness and death is an individual tragedy, but the cost of vaccine hesitancy also enforces a shared public toll.\n\nConsider the ongoing measles outbreak in Washington State, which is centered in Clark County, on the Oregon border. In January, when it had racked up 26 cases, the state governor declared a public health emergency. Since then, the case count has almost tripled, to 74.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Subscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.\n\nTo figure out who might have been put at risk, the state health department has interviewed 4,652 people and closely monitored 812 of them. It has reassigned staff from across its divisions, borrowed public health workers from other states, sent people who would normally be at desks out into the field, performed hundreds of lab tests that would not normally be necessary. So far, it has spent $1.6 million.\n\n“It is extremely frustrating,” says John Wiesman, an epidemiologist and the state secretary of health. “To know the financial cost of this but also to know all the work that is not getting done, or getting backlogged.”\n\nIn coverage of the dangers of vaccine hesitancy, cost doesn’t get discussed much. But it’s not unusual for a preventable disease outbreak to rack up a bill as high as Washington’s.\n\nIn 2005, a 17-year-old girl whose family belonged to a church that discouraged vaccination went on a mission trip to Europe. The day after the group arrived home, the church threw a party; 34 attendees caught measles from the teen or from someone she infected. Not including medical care, containing that outbreak cost $167,685. When they analyzed the spending, the CDC and the state health department calculated it had taken 3,650 work hours, 4,800 phone calls, and 5,500 miles of car trips to track the victims down. In 2008, an unvaccinated infected traveler brought measles to a hospital in Tucson; the cost of containing the outbreak, which spread to a second hospital, was almost $800,000.\n\nThe numbers can grow much bigger still. Researchers at the CDC estimated that handling 107 cases of measles that occurred in 2011 cost state and local health departments between $2.7 million and $5.3 million. In 2014, 42 people came down with the disease after passing through Disneyland at the same time as a never-identified person with measles—and subsequently infected 90 additional people in California, 14 more in other states, and a further 159 people in Canada. The cost of controlling the outbreak, just in California, totaled almost $4 million. And in 2017, a five-month outbreak of measles in Minnesota infected 79 people and cost the state $2.3 million.\n\nThe funding to support that work isn’t being conjured out of the air. It’s coming from the budgets of public agencies, which have already been facing years of cuts and have no secret stashes of discretionary money to spend.\n\n“There are substantial public health responses that go into mitigating an outbreak, and we should pursue those, because they prevent larger outbreaks or broader social disruption,” says Saad Omer, a physician and epidemiologist at Emory University and the senior author of a recent paper on the “true cost” of measles outbreaks. “But it does result in a lot of costs that can be pretty substantial. And we don’t measure the further indirect costs to the community.”\n\nIn Washington State, those indirect costs include the other work that doesn’t get done while the outbreak proceeds. The state health department was forced to appropriate a portion of its poison control center’s work hours to handle the calls made by people worried they had been exposed to measles. In Clark County, the local health department reassigned to measles the home-visit nurses who take care of risky pregnancies, and also the investigators who track down victims of sexually transmitted diseases and foodborne illnesses.\n\nMost of the havoc wreaked by outbreaks of otherwise preventable diseases can only be measured qualitatively: a parent’s terror; a child’s loss of weeks at school; a neighborhood or city’s frayed social bonds. (In Clark County, Wiesman says, “People are staying home, afraid to go out, cancelling birthday parties.”)\n\nBut we can quantify the medical and public health response. It is the bottom lines on hospital bills, for medical care that would not otherwise have been necessary. (In the tetanus case, the hospital has declined to say whether the parents or their insurance will pay, or whether the hospital will eat the cost as charity care.) It’s lab work that was never budgeted for, hotel charges and gas for investigators sent out on the road, overtime hours for state police rushing emergency doses of immunotherapy across the state.\n\nThose costs are being paid by state governments, and by federal agencies such as the CDC that give states grants and loan them personnel. State and federal budgets are public money—which means those necessary bills for unnecessary outbreaks are being paid by all of us. The toll of illness may be confined to individuals, but the cost of responding to outbreaks related to vaccine refusal is a bill that we are all being compelled to pay.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories",

        "text": "Vaccination rates among California kindergartners rose last year, and fewer students skipped shots because of their parents' personal beliefs about immunizations, according to state officials. The changes, though slight, suggest that a state law barring parents from refusing to have their kids vaccinated appears to have had some impact even before taking effect later this year.\n\nMore than half a million children attend public or private kindergarten in California. Information collected during the fall for the 2015-2016 school year shows 92.9 percent of children received all of the required vaccinations. That's up from 90.4 percent in 2014 and 90.2 percent in 2013, according to a report by the California Department of Public Health.\n\nThe information tracks the vaccination rates for polio; diptheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTAP); measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR); hepatitis B; and varicella, better known as chicken pox. The data show just 2.38 percent of children entering kindergarten had a personal belief exemption, which parents can use to skirt vaccination requirements. That's slightly fewer than in 2014, when 2.54 percent of children had the exemptions, and 2013, when 3.15 percent had them.\n\nFor years West Virginia and Mississippi have barred personal belief exemptions and required nearly all children attending school to be vaccinated; more recently a number of other states have joined their ranks. Last year California state lawmakers, prompted by a measles outbreak that started at Disneyland and eventually sickened 113 people, passed SB277, eliminating parents' ability to claim that their personal beliefs prohibit them from vaccinating their children. Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill into law on June 30 last year. And although schools don't need to implement the law until July 1 this year, California is already seeing a decline in exemptions.\n\nTransmission of measles is largely, but not entirely, prevented by vaccines like the MMR, a shot administered in two doses—the first around age 1 and the second between 4 and 6. Nationwide, the number of measles cases dropped so dramatically after the vaccine's introduction in 1963 that in 2000 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared the disease eliminated in the United States. But the disease has seen a re-emergence in recent years, due in part to a medical journal article, which was subsequently retracted, that falsely linked autism with the MMR. The disease claimed its first fatality in 12 years last year, killing a woman in Washington. Nearly half of the people who contracted measles in the US in 2015 were not vaccinated, according to the CDC.\n\nBecause SB277 does not take effect for another five months, its impact on childhood vaccination rates won't be known until data for the 2016-2017 school year is released next year. Still, the upward trend is promising. Los Angeles county, which has the state's largest school district and is responsible for educating one-quarter of all California kindergarteners, saw a four-point rise in its vaccination rate, an increase of nearly 9,000 children. The rate among San Francisco kindergartners climbed from 86.4 percent during the last school year to 92.5 percent for the current one.\n\nThat said, more than 13,000 children starting kindergarten in California in 2015 were not vaccinated due to a personal belief exemption. More troubling, half of the state's 58 counties reported that their measles vaccination rate for kindergarteners did not meet the threshold for herd immunity—that is, the level at which transmission of the disease can be most effectively prevented. Trinity county, in northern California, claims the lowest vaccination rate, with just 77.0 percent of enrolled kindergarteners up-to-date on their shots; Nevada county, northwest of Lake Tahoe, is right behind Trinity with 77.1 percent of kids immunized. The award for the county with the highest vaccination rate goes to Alpine, south of Lake Tahoe, though the county reported data for a mere six kindergarteners.\n\nThe state's data isn't foolproof, however. When WIRED reported last year that some day care facilities affiliated with prominent Silicon Valley companies had subpar vaccination rates, some of them claimed their rates were higher than the state's data suggested. There is some evidence to support this. For example, the state reported that 83 percent of the 18 kindergartners enrolled at the San Francisco campus of AltSchool, a chain of private schools founded by former Google executive Max Ventilla, were vaccinated. The remaining 17 percent claimed a personal belief exemption. Yet the school says 83 kindergarteners matriculated in San Francisco this year.\n\n\"We do have a small percentage of students who had existing medical exemptions or personal belief exemptions,\" says Michael Ginty, head of safety and security at the school. \"But we have more than 18 kindergarteners, so this information doesn't seem accurate to me. In the data we reported at the end of October, of all the kindergarteners and seventh graders, we had only one student with a personal belief exemption. All other students were immunized or on track to be immunized.\"\n\nBut Carlos Villatoro of the California Department of Public Health says the state stands by the numbers. \"AltSchool in San Francisco reported data individually on three schools, each with separate addresses and identification numbers,\" says Villatoro. The DPH data refers to one of the school's three San Francisco locations. \"That 83 percent in the spreadsheet refers to 15 out of 18 children who were reported as having received all required immunizations.\"\n\nSome of the companies identified WIRED's report last year promised this year's numbers would be better. That data will be available in February.\n\nUPDATE 01/21/16, 3 pm PST: This story was updated to include a comment from the California Department of Public Health.",

It is safe, it is effective, it is time-tested.”\n\nThe measure follows a spike in measles infections in New York City, where there have been 285 confirmed cases since the outbreak began in the fall; 21 of those cases led to hospitalizations, including five admissions to the intensive care unit.\n\nCity officials conceded that the earlier order in December, which banned unvaccinated students from attending schools in certain sections of Brooklyn, was not effective. Mr. de Blasio said on Tuesday that the city would fine or even temporarily shut down yeshivas that did not abide by the measure.\n\n“There has been some real progress in addressing the issue, but it’s just not working fast enough and it was time to take a more muscular approach,” Mr. de Blasio said.\n\n[What are the religious exemptions to the vaccine?]\n\nTo enforce the order, health officials said they did not intend to perform random spot checks on students; instead, as new measles cases arose, officials would check the vaccination records of any individuals who were in contact with those infected.",
