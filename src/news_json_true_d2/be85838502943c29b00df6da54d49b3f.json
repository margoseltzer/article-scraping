        "text": "Image copyright Science Photo Library\n\nFear of a vaccine's side effects is the top reason for people refusing them, a report from the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) suggests.\n\nAmong parents, this was fuelled by social media, with up to half exposed to negative messages about vaccines.\n\nThe Society's report, sponsored by US pharmaceutical company Merck, called for social media platforms and the media to do more to combat \"fake news\".\n\nVaccines have saved millions of lives, and side effects are rare, it said.\n\n\"The spread of misinformation - if it impacts uptake of vaccines - could severely damage the public's health,\" said Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the RSPH.\n\nEngland's chief medical officer Prof Dame Sally Davies recently said parents should ignore myths spread by anti-vaccine campaigners and get their children vaccinated.\n\nWhat's in the report?\n\nIt contains the findings of surveys of nearly 5,000 people across the UK on their awareness and attitudes towards vaccines, such as MMR, the flu jab and HPV.\n\nThey include 2,600 parents, 2,000 other adults and more than 200 healthcare professionals, such as nurses, pharmacists and GPs.\n\nWhat do parents say?\n\nOn the whole, the report found parents' attitudes to vaccines were largely positive, with 90% getting their children vaccinated routinely.\n\nIn the UK this amounts to 10 or 11 different vaccinations, some with a number of doses.\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library\n\nBut roughly one in 10 parents surveyed said they had chosen not to give their child the MMR jab, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella.\n\nThe main reasons given were concerns over side effects, followed by doubts over whether the vaccine worked.\n\nFor the flu jab, one in five parents chose not to give it to their child while one in 14 refused an HPV jab for their teenage daughter.\n\nAgain, those parents expressed worries over unwanted side effects.\n\nHave they got a point?\n\nAll vaccines have potential side effects, but they are usually mild such as a headache or tiredness, and affect a tiny number of people.\n\nMore serious side effects are extremely rare, equivalent to fewer than one in a million cases, according to the report.\n\nVaccines have dramatically reduced the number of people suffering with infectious diseases around the world.\n\nThey are important right throughout life - from childhood into adulthood and beyond.\n\nWhat part does social media play?\n\nIt can spread misinformation or \"fake news\" about vaccine safety, despite very good evidence to the contrary, the report says.\n\nPeople in all age groups said they were more likely to see negative messages about vaccines on social media than positive ones.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nParents can also be heavily influenced by negative headlines in newspapers and online, and it can take a long time to change people's perceptions.\n\nEven 20 years after Andrew Wakefield published his now discredited paper on an alleged link between the MMR vaccine and autism, \"Europe is still living with the consequences\", the report said.\n\nAnti-vaccine campaigners do not help either. Their messages can lead to misleading discussions around possible side effects and undermine the public's confidence, according to the report.\n\nWhat does the RSPH recommend?\n\nIt wants more education in schools around the value and importance of vaccination, to help bust the myths surrounding vaccines.\n\nIt also wants to see vaccinations being offered in different locations, such as high-street pop-ups, gyms and community centres, to encourage uptake.\n\nAnd it wants the press and social media platforms to clamp down on \"fake news\".",
