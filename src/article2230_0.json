        "text": "By MusicDish\nThursday, September 14, 2017 14:02\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\nMissing Link Music has recently signed a worldwide administration deal with jazz hero Najee. A two-time Grammy-nominated saxophonist and flautist, Najee has made a career following his heart and keen musical intuition by pushing musical boundaries, all of which have made him an international pioneer in the music industry. Having collaborated with Prince, Quincy Jones, Stevie Wonder, Chaka Khan and Herbie Hancock, Najee’s technical agility, grace, and compositional prowess have made him one of the most sought after musicians of his generation.  \"My first love was the tenor saxophone and flute,\" confides Najee. \"It was my brother Fareed who got me to play soprano saxophone.\" As an industrious and hungry young musician, Najee had the good fortune of coming through Dr. Billy Taylor’s now legendary Jazzmobile program. While a student at the New England Conservatory he studied saxophone with Joe Allard, while performing with the George Russell and Jaki Byard Big Bands. After his studies at the conservatory, Najee returned to New York in the early 80s and was lucky to land a gig with Chaka Khan, along with his brother and guitarist Fareed (who is now his manager).  The late '90s were marked by extraordinary international experiences, from performing at Nelson Mandela’s birthday celebration in South Africa to playing as a special guest of President Clinton at the White House for an event honoring President Jerry Rawlings of the Republic of Ghana.  Coming full circle in 2017 with the release of \"You, Me, and Forever\", Najee concludes, \"Making music at this point in my career is still exciting and I am always evolving. As a musician, the love of performing for people whether in studio or live is still a gratifying experience. The best feeling to me is presenting something new to the world!\"  The Missing Link team is honored to work with such a great talent and extremely excited to see what new music Najee will bestow to us in the future.
