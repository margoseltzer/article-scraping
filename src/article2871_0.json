Add your two cents.\nTexans rookie quarterback DeShaun Watson wasn’t looking to be in the public eye with his latest display of charity, but you have to love what he did, taking his first game check and handing it over to three women who lost all of their worldly possession in the Hurricane that impacted much of Houston.\nVery classy of @deshaunwatson to give his first game check to 3 women who work in the team cafeteria and lost everything in the flood.\nWatston is due to make roughly $23,250 a game this season, a great gesture for a young man trying to make an impact in the community and helping others.\n#Texans rookie QB DeShaun Watson donated his first game check to stadium employees recovering from Hurricane Harvey. pic.twitter.com/mfnbC8OfMG\nSupport BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!
