And, we had a very good mayor. But New York City was incredible the way that worked. So, I think that would be one step you could do.\"\nUse of the proactive technique, promoted by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has long angered many civil rights activists. In 2013, a judge in New York ruled that it had been carried out in an unconstitutional, racially discriminatory manner. An appeals court halted that ruling, but while the appeal was pending, the city — under new Mayor Bill de Blasio  —wound up settling the case.\nIn comments Thursday, Trump revised his earlier remarks , insisting he was only advocating the practice in murder-plagued Chicago.\n“I was really referring to Chicago with stop-and-frisk,” he told “Fox and Friends” during a phone interview Thursday morning. “They asked me about Chicago and I was talking about stop-and-frisk for Chicago.”\nChicago has seen a spike in murders and shootings, with over 500 killings in 2016 and three months still to go in the year.\n\"I think Chicago needs stop-and-frisk,” Trump said. “Now, people can criticize me for that or people can say whatever they want, but they asked me about Chicago, and I think stop-and-frisk, with good, strong, you know, good, strong law and order. But you have to do something. It can’t continue the way it’s going.”\nLynch, who spent two stints as chief federal prosecutor in Brooklyn before being nominated as attorney general, said she wasn't opposed to stop-and-frisk techniques under certain circumstances.\n\"As with every police procedure we want to empower law enforcement to be responsive to community needs. We want to empower them to protect the community. We want to give them the training they need in order to do it in a way that is constitutional, safe and effective and promotes trust,\" Lynch said. \"It’s not really a yes or no answer.\"\nUPDATE (Thursday, 4:09 p.m.): This post has been updated to clarify the outcome of the New York City stop-and-frisk litigation.\nJosh Gerstein is a senior reporter for POLITICO.\nThis article tagged under:\n",
