        "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nOn Sunday morning, Donald Trump went off on a Twitter tirade against a member of his own party.\n\nThis, in itself, isn't exactly huge news. It's far from the first time the president has turned his rhetorical cannons on his own ranks.\n\nThis time, however, his attacks were particularly biting and personal. He essentially called Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, the chair of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a coward for not running for re-election.\n\nHe said Mr Corker \"begged\" for the president's endorsement, which he refused to give. He wrongly claimed that Mr Corker's support of the Iranian nuclear agreement was his only political accomplishment.\n\nUnlike some of his colleagues, Mr Corker - free from having to worry about his immediate political future - didn't hold his tongue.\n\nThat wasn't the end of it, though. He then spoke with the New York Times and really let the president have it. Here are four choice quotes from the Tennessee senator's interview with the Times and why they are particularly damning.\n\n\"I don't know why the president tweets out things that are not true. You know he does it, everyone knows he does it, but he does.\"\n\nYou can't really sugarcoat this one. Mr Corker is flat-out saying the president is a liar - and everyone knows it.\n\nThe senator, in particular, is challenging Mr Trump's insistence that he unsuccessfully pleaded for his endorsement, but the accusation is much broader.\n\nMr Corker and the president used to be something akin to allies. The Tennessean was on Mr Trump's short list for vice-president and secretary of state.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Bob Corker at Trump campaign rally in July 2016\n\nThose days are seemingly very much over now - and it's not like Mr Corker is going anywhere anytime soon. Although he's not running for re-election, he'll be in the Senate, chairing a powerful committee, until January 2019.\n\nThe president's margin for success in that chamber is razor-thin. If Democrats can continue to stand together in opposition, he can afford to lose only two votes out of 52 Republican senators. That's why healthcare reform collapsed in July - and it could be bad news for tax efforts.\n\nFrom here on out, Mr Corker isn't going to do the president any favours.\n\n\"Look, except for a few people, the vast majority of our caucus understands what we're dealing with here.\"\n\nFrustration in Congress has been growing over what Republicans feel has been the president's inability to focus on advancing their agenda. Getting a sharply divided party to come together on plans to repeal Obamacare, reform taxes or boost infrastructure spending is challenging enough. Doing so when the president stirs up unrelated controversies on a seemingly daily basis makes things all the harder.\n\nOne of the president's gifts has been his ability to shake off negative stories by quickly moving on to a different subject. That worked brilliantly during his presidential campaign, but it's less effective during the legislative slow grind.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Corker at the confirmation hearing for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\n\nFor months, Republicans in Congress have been grumbling about this in the background and among themselves. Occasionally, someone like Mr McConnell will lament that the president doesn't understand how the Senate works.\n\nMr Corker has now stated it loud and clear. And, what's more, he says almost everyone agrees with him. They've kept silent until now because they still hope to pass conservative legislation that the president can sign or fear Mr Trump's legions will back a primary challenge next year or stay home during the general election.\n\nIf that calculus ever changes - if it becomes riskier to stay silent than speak out - Mr Trump will be in real trouble.\n\n\"A lot of people think that there is some kind of 'good cop, bad cop' act underway, but that's just not true.\"\n\nTime and again, Mr Trump has appeared to undercut Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others in his administration who are attempting to use soft diplomacy to deal with a range of international crises.\n\nThe war against the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran's compliance with the multinational nuclear agreement, the ongoing dispute between Qatar and its Persian Gulf neighbours, the unrest in Venezuela and, most recently, North Korea's continued ballistic missile tests have all been the target of the president's offhand remarks and Twitter invective.\n\nSome administration defenders have said this is all a part of Mr Trump's strategy - an updated version of the Nixon-era \"madman theory\", in which the president forces adversaries to give way because they fear an unpredictable US leader's actions.\n\nMr Corker isn't buying it. There's no strategy, he says, just the possibility of chaos - which he hopes Mr Trump's senior advisers will be able to avoid.\n\n\"I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it's a situation of trying to contain him.\"\n\nThere's now a growing collection of John Kelly face-palm photos that serve as a testament to the chief-of-staff's reported frustration at dealing with the president.\n\nMr Trump goes off-script to praise torch-bearing white nationalists at a rally in Charlottesville, and Mr Kelly is captured closing his eyes and rubbing the arch of his nose, as if attempting to stave off a migraine.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption White House Chief of Staff John Kelly looks on as US President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally\n\nThe president calls North Korean leaders \"criminals\" in a speech to the United Nations, and Mr Kelly straight-up buries his face in his hands.\n\nThe White House communications team is often left scrambling to try to explain or reframe an indelicate presidential \"joke\" or remark that directly contradicts what was until then the official administration line.\n\nEven though Mr Kelly has brought some discipline to the West Wing staff, the president still marches to the beat of his own drum - and continues to have unfettered access to his phone's Twitter app.\n\nBob Corker is only the latest person - politician, journalist, sports star or celebrity - to feel the mercurial president's uncontainable ire.",

        "text": "The turmoil in Charlottesville began with a march Friday night by white nationalists on the campus of the University of Virginia and escalated Saturday morning as demonstrators from both sides gathered in and around the park. Waving Confederate flags, chanting Nazi-era slogans, wearing helmets and carrying shields, the white nationalists converged on the Lee statue inside the park and began chanting phrases like “You will not replace us” and “Jews will not replace us.”\n\nHundreds of counterprotesters — religious leaders, Black Lives Matter activists and anti-fascist groups known as “antifa” — quickly surrounded the park, singing spirituals, chanting and carrying their own signs.\n\nThe morning started peacefully, with the white nationalists gathering in McIntire Park, outside downtown, and the counterdemonstrators — including Cornel R. West, the Harvard University professor and political activist — gathering at the First Baptist Church, a historically African-American church here. Professor West, who addressed the group at a sunrise prayer service, said he had come “bearing witness to love and justice in the face of white supremacy.”\n\nAt McIntire Park, the white nationalists waved Confederate flags and other banners. One of the participants, who gave his name only as Ted because he said he might want to run for political office some day, said he was from Missouri, and added, “I’m tired of seeing white people pushed around.”\n\nBut by 11 a.m., after both sides had made their way to Emancipation Park, the scene had exploded into taunting, shoving and outright brawling. Three people were arrested in connection with the skirmishes.\n\nBarricades encircling the park and separating the two sides began to come down, and the police temporarily retreated. People were seen clubbing one another in the streets, and pepper spray filled the air. One of the white nationalists left the park bleeding, his head wrapped in gauze.",

        "text": "But other than Mr. Corker, few rushed to Mr. Tillerson’s defense in recent days, reflecting a larger disappointment with him.\n\nMr. Tillerson was an unconventional choice for the job in the first place. While he spent 41 years at Exxon Mobil, working his way up to chief executive of the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company, he was the first secretary of state in American history without prior experience in government, politics or the military, working for the nation’s first president also without such a background.\n\nNo matter how often successful business leaders like Mr. Tillerson assume they can master the public sector just as they did the private sector, government rarely submits to the will of the new master. At Exxon Mobil, Mr. Tillerson was the undisputed chief whose orders were not to be ignored and who had no need to engage the public if he chose not to. After 10 years running one of the largest companies on the planet, he was unaccustomed to the role of subordinate. And Mr. Trump does not make it easy for anyone to make that transition.\n\nThe most successful secretaries of state were those with close working relationships with their presidents, like Dean Acheson under Harry Truman, John Foster Dulles under Dwight D. Eisenhower, Henry A. Kissinger under Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, and George P. Shultz under Ronald Reagan. Condoleezza Rice was so close to Mr. Bush that she was seen as the most influential member of the administration in his second term.\n\n“The ideal situation is where there is a direct and close relationship with the president whereby the secretary of state is seen as the primary spokesperson of the president and the administration on foreign policy,” said Edward P. Djerejian, a longtime diplomat and director of Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. “This means the president has to empower the secretary of state in this role.”\n\nNo secretary of state was as close to his president as James A. Baker III, who had been a personal friend of the elder George Bush for decades since their days as tennis doubles partners at the Houston Country Club. “Nobody was going to get between me and my president,” Mr. Baker said repeatedly.\n\nOther secretaries who could not reconcile themselves with their presidents did not fare as well. William Jennings Bryan quit in protest of Woodrow Wilson’s policies leading to entry in World War I, while Cyrus Vance resigned in protest of Jimmy Carter’s decision to mount what was ultimately a failed military operation to rescue American hostages in Iran. Colin L. Powell was boxed out by rivals under the younger Mr. Bush and left unhappily. John Kerry was not close to Barack Obama but ultimately won support from his president for his Iran nuclear deal.",
